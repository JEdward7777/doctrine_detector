## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the ancient Israelite religion, only the High Priest was permitted to enter the 'most holy place' in the Tabernacle or Temple, and that too only on the Day of Atonement. This restriction was important because it symbolized the sacredness and purity of the presence of God. It emphasized the reverence and awe with which the Israelites viewed the divine and highlighted the separation between humanity and the transcendent. By limiting access to the 'most holy place,' it underscored the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement to maintain a harmonious relationship with the divine.
