## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As a scholar, my view is that the term "Son of God" should not necessarily be avoided in translations due to potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures. It is important to accurately convey the religious and cultural concepts present in the original text, while also providing explanations or footnotes to aid in understanding for readers from different cultural backgrounds.

In many monotheistic traditions, including Christianity, the term "Son of God" carries specific theological significance and is not meant to be understood in a literal, biological sense. Explaining this context can help to mitigate misunderstandings and facilitate cross-cultural understanding.

Furthermore, translations should strive to maintain the integrity and nuances of the original text, even if it means risking potential misinterpretations. It is ultimately up to the readers to engage critically with the text and seek further clarification if needed.
