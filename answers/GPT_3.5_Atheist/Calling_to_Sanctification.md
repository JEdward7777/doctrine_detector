## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of personal sanctification is rooted in religious beliefs and practices. However, it can be understood as a way for individuals to strive for moral and ethical development. In a secular context, the "command" for individuals to work towards personal growth and improvement can come from various sources such as societal norms, ethical principles, personal values, and scientific understanding of human behavior. Ultimately, each individual has the autonomy to determine their own path towards personal development and betterment without the need for external divine commands.

## Grade
40.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 40

Comment: The response fails to adequately address the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process, as it focuses more on societal norms and individual autonomy rather than the specific command for believers in Jesus to sanctify themselves to God. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, sanctification is viewed as a process empowered by the Holy Spirit, not solely based on personal values and scientific understanding.
