## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Conscience in a biblical sense is often understood as an inner sense of right and wrong, a moral compass that guides individuals in making decisions. In Christian beliefs, conscience is thought to be shaped by one's understanding of God's moral law as revealed in the Bible and through the teachings of the Church.

The concept of conscience can be found in various passages of the Bible, such as in Romans 2:15, where it is described as bearing witness to the moral law written on people's hearts. According to Christian beliefs, conscience functions as a tool for discerning moral truths and making judgments about one's actions.

Christians believe that a well-formed conscience is essential for living a morally upright life and following God's will. It is seen as a gift from God that should be cultivated through prayer, reflection, and study of scripture. However, conscience is not infallible, and Christians are encouraged to form their consciences in accordance with the teachings of the Church and to seek guidance from religious authorities when faced with moral dilemmas.

Overall, in Christian beliefs, conscience serves as a guide for moral decision-making, helping individuals to discern right from wrong and to act in accordance with God's will.
