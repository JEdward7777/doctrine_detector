In Christianity, the importance of fulfilling promises or vows made before God is emphasized in several biblical teachings. The Bible teaches that making vows or promises before God is a serious matter, and failing to keep them is considered a sin.

In the book of Ecclesiastes 5:4-6, it says, "When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it."

Therefore, Christians are encouraged to be honest and faithful in their commitments, including promises made before God. Breaking a vow or promise is seen as a betrayal of trust and a lack of integrity. Christians believe that honoring their commitments is a reflection of their relationship with God and their obedience to His commandments.

Ultimately, keeping promises and vows made before God is seen as a crucial aspect of demonstrating one's faith and devotion in Christianity.
