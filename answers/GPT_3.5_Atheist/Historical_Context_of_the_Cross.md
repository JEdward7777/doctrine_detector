## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Roman practice of crucifixion certainly played a significant role in shaping the perception of the cross in early Christianity. Crucifixion was a brutal and public form of execution, reserved for slaves, rebels, and criminals. In Roman society, it was a symbol of shame, humiliation, and extreme punishment.

Early Christians, many of whom were familiar with the horrors of crucifixion, embraced the symbol of the cross as central to their faith. They saw in the suffering and death of Jesus on the cross a message of hope, redemption, and salvation. The cross became a powerful symbol of sacrifice, love, and victory over sin and death.

By appropriating the symbol of the cross, early Christians were able to transform a tool of Roman oppression into a symbol of faith and resilience. The cross came to represent the ultimate act of love and selflessness, with Jesus willingly choosing to endure the pain and shame of crucifixion for the sake of humanity.

In this way, the Roman practice of crucifixion helped shape the perception of the cross in early Christianity, turning it from a symbol of death and destruction into a symbol of hope and salvation.
