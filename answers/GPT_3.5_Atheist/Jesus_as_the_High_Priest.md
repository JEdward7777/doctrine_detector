## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, Jesus is often described as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek. This is significant because the traditional Jewish priesthood, descended from Aaron, had strict requirements and limitations. However, the order of Melchizedek, to which Jesus belongs according to the book of Hebrews, is seen as superior and eternal.

This portrayal of Jesus as a high priest highlights his role as a mediator between humanity and God, as well as emphasizing his uniqueness and authority. It is also seen as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, particularly in terms of a new covenant and a new way of approaching God.

Overall, the New Testament presents Jesus as a high priest in a revolutionary and transcendent sense, breaking free from traditional constraints and offering a new way for believers to connect with the divine.
