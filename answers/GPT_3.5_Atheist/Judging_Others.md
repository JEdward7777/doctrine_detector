## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, Christians are advised not to judge one another. The passage most often cited in this regard is from Matthew 7:1-5, which states, "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."

This verse is commonly interpreted to mean that Christians should focus on self-examination and self-improvement rather than passing judgment on others. It is believed that only God has the ultimate authority to judge individuals, and that it is not the place of humans to act as judge over their fellow believers.
