## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Jesus teaches us in the Bible that before we point out the faults of others, we should first take a look at our own faults. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says, "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?" This teaches us that we should first acknowledge and address our own faults before we judge or criticize others.

By focusing on our own faults first, we can approach others with humility and understanding, rather than self-righteousness. Jesus emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and personal growth in order to truly help and support others in their own journey towards improvement.

Therefore, before pointing out the faults of others, we should always consider our own faults and strive to be a better person ourselves. This introspective approach can lead to more compassionate and constructive interactions with others, in line with the teachings of Jesus.
