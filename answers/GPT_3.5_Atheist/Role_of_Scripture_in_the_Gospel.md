## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Bible illustrates the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message through various examples of Jesus and the apostles quoting from the Old Testament to convey key truths about the coming of the Messiah and the salvation he offers. For instance, Jesus often quoted passages from the Hebrew Scriptures to demonstrate how they pointed to Himself as the fulfillment of God's promises.

In addition, we see examples in the New Testament of the apostles using Scripture to explain and proclaim the Gospel message to both Jews and Gentiles. In Acts 17:2-3, we see Paul reasoning with the Jews in the synagogue, explaining and proving that Jesus is the Christ by referring to the Scriptures. Similarly, in Acts 18:28, Apollos vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.

Overall, the Bible shows us that Scripture plays a central role in sharing the Gospel message, as it provides the foundation and authority for proclaiming the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ.
