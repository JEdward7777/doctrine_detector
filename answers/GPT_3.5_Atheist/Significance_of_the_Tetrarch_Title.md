## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The title "tetrarch" was used during the time of Jesus to refer to a ruler who was in charge of a fourth part of a region or territory within the Roman Empire. This governance structure indicated a system of decentralized power where larger regions were subdivided into smaller administrative units, each ruled by a tetrarch.

In the case of Jesus, one of the most well-known tetrarchs was Herod Antipas, who ruled over Galilee and Perea. The presence of tetrarchs like Herod Antipas highlights the complex political landscape of the time, with various rulers exerting authority over different areas under the overall umbrella of Roman control.

The use of the title "tetrarch" underscores the intricate web of power dynamics and hierarchies that characterized governance during Jesus' time, showcasing the blend of Roman imperial administration with local rulers appointed to maintain control and stability in the conquered territories.
