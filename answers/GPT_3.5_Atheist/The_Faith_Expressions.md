In the context of belief in Jesus, the phrase "keep the faith" typically means to maintain a steadfast commitment to one's belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior. It involves continuing to trust in his teachings, following his example, and remaining dedicated to the principles of love, forgiveness, and compassion that he preached.
