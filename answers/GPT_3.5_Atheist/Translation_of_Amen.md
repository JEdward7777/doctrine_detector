When Jesus used the word "truly" in phrases such as "truly I tell you," he was often emphasizing the importance or certainty of what he was about to say. In a culturally retributed way, we could consider alternative translations that capture this sense of solemnity or gravity. Some potential translations could include:

- "Verily" - an older English term that conveys a sense of truth and certainty.
- "Indeed" - emphasizing the truthfulness or validity of the statement.
- "Assuredly" - indicating a strong affirmation or conviction in what is being said.
- "I solemnly say to you" - highlighting the seriousness and significance of the message being imparted.

These translations seek to convey the gravity and certainty with which Jesus spoke, in a culturally retributed manner that reflects the solemnity of his words.
