Comment: The response provided an appropriate suggestion for translating the term "saints" by using inclusive language like "holy believers in Jesus." While this addresses the concern of being inclusive, it falls short of offering alternative translations that avoid specific Christian connotations altogether. Further exploration of culturally respectful terms would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
