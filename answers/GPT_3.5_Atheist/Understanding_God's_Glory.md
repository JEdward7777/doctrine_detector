## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, the concept of God's glory is often linked to his power, holiness, and majesty. It is seen as a transcendent and divine attribute that sets God apart from all worldly sources of glory. God's glory is considered to be eternal and unchanging, reflecting his perfection and sovereignty over all creation.

On the other hand, worldly sources of glory are often temporary, fleeting, and ultimately meaningless in comparison to God's glory. Worldly glory is often associated with human achievements, wealth, fame, and status, which are all subject to change and decay. Unlike God's glory, worldly glory can be shallow, self-centered, and ultimately unsatisfying.

Overall, the concept of God's glory in the Bible emphasizes the supreme and unrivaled nature of God's character, while worldly sources of glory are seen as insignificant and fleeting in comparison.
