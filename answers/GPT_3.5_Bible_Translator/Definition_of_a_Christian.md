The biblical definition of a Christian is someone who believes in and follows Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. In Acts 11:26, it says that the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch, likely because they were known for their strong belief in Jesus Christ. Being a Christian is not just about identifying with a particular religion or culture, but it is a personal and life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ, where one accepts His sacrifice on the cross for their sins, repents of their sins, and seeks to live in obedience to Him. Being a Christian involves faith in Jesus, repentance, and a commitment to following Him in all aspects of life.
