After King Solomon's reign, the kingdom of Israel divided into two separate kingdoms: the northern kingdom of Israel with its capital in Samaria, and the southern kingdom of Judah with its capital in Jerusalem. This division occurred around 930 BC following the reign of Solomon's son, Rehoboam. The northern kingdom of Israel eventually fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC, while the southern kingdom of Judah was later conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BC.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a basic understanding of the division of Israel into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah after King Solomon's reign. It mentions the historical fact of the division but lacks depth in explaining the significance, both historically and spiritually, of this division within the context of the Israelite kingdom and God's plan for His people. More elaboration on the spiritual implications and the reasons behind this division would enhance the response.
