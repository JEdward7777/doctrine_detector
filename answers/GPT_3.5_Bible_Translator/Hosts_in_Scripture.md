## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "hosts" is used in various contexts throughout the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament. In the original Hebrew, the word often translated as "hosts" is "Sabaoth" or "Tzeva'ot," which can mean "armies" or "mighty ones." 

One common usage of the term "hosts" is in reference to the armies of Israel or of other nations. For example, in 1 Samuel 17:45, David declares to Goliath, "You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied." In this context, "hosts" refers to the supernatural army of angels under God's command.

Another common usage of the term "hosts" is in reference to the heavenly armies of angels. In Isaiah 6:3, the seraphim around the throne of God cry out, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" This emphasizes God's sovereignty and majesty over all creation.

In some instances, the term "hosts" is also used to refer to the heavenly bodies, such as the stars and planets. In Genesis 2:1, it says, "Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array," with the term "hosts" indicating the multitude of celestial bodies created by God.

Overall, the term "hosts" in scripture encompasses the armies of angels under God's command, the armies of Israel, and the heavenly bodies created by God, all of which reflect his power, authority, and sovereignty over all creation.
