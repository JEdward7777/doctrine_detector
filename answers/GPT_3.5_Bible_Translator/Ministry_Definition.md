To "minister" to others according to the Bible means to serve, care for, and support others in various ways, especially in the context of sharing God's love, grace, and truth with them. In the New Testament, the concept of ministering to others is closely tied to the idea of serving as Jesus did, with humility and sacrificial love.

Ministering can take many forms, including acts of kindness, encouragement, prayer, teaching, and helping those in need. It often involves meeting both the physical and spiritual needs of others, as seen in passages such as Matthew 25:35-40, where Jesus instructs his followers to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, visit the sick, and care for those in prison.

Ultimately, ministering to others is a way to reflect the love of God and to point people towards Him. It is a privilege and responsibility for all believers to share the good news of Jesus Christ and to live out his teachings in their interactions with others.
