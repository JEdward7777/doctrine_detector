## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, Christians are encouraged to exhort one another in love and with humility. The apostle Paul, for example, often wrote letters to the early churches exhorting them to live in ways that are pleasing to God.

One key aspect of exhortation found in the New Testament is the importance of speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). This means that when we exhort our brothers and sisters in Christ, we should do so with the goal of building them up and encouraging them to grow in their faith, rather than tearing them down or being judgmental.

Another important aspect of exhortation is the need for humility. In Galatians 6:1-2, we are reminded to restore those who have fallen in a spirit of gentleness, considering ourselves lest we also be tempted. This shows that exhortation should be done in a spirit of humility, recognizing that we ourselves are also in need of grace and correction.

Overall, Christians should approach exhortation with a heart of love, humility, and a desire to see others grow in their faith and relationship with God. It should always be done in a spirit of gentleness and with the goal of building up the body of Christ.
