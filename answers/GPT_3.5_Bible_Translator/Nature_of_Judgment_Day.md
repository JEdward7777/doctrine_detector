## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In a Christian context according to the Bible, "judgment day" refers to the final day when God will judge all people according to their deeds and faith. This concept is primarily found in the New Testament, particularly in passages like Matthew 25:31-46 and Revelation 20:11-15.

On judgment day, God will separate the righteous from the unrighteous. The righteous, who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, will inherit eternal life in heaven. The unrighteous, who have rejected God and His salvation, will face eternal punishment in hell.

It is important for Christians to live in a way that is pleasing to God, knowing that one day they will stand before Him to give an account of their lives. Judgment day serves as a reminder of God's righteousness and justice, as well as the importance of living a life of faith and obedience to Him.
