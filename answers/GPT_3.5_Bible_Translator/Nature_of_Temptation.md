## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, our sinful nature and external influences both play significant roles in temptation. Our sinful nature, inherited from the fall of humanity in Adam and Eve's disobedience, makes us prone to selfish desires and disobedience to God's will. This sinful nature creates a natural tendency to prioritize our own interests over God's commands.

External influences, such as the world, Satan, and our peers, can also contribute to temptation by presenting us with opportunities and enticements to sin. The apostle John warns in 1 John 2:16 that "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life" are not of the Father but are of the world, leading us away from God's will.

Therefore, both our sinful nature and external influences can work hand in hand to lead us into temptation, making it crucial for Christians to rely on the power of the Holy Spirit, prayer, and the Word of God to resist temptations and walk in obedience to God.
