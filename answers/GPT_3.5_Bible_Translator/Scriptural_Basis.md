## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Propitiation refers to the act of appeasing God's wrath and satisfying His justice. There are several Bible verses that support this concept:

1. Romans 3:25 - "God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his bloodâ€”to be received by faith."

2. 1 John 2:2 - "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."

3. Hebrews 2:17 - "For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people."

4. 1 John 4:10 - "This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins."

These verses emphasize the central role of Jesus Christ's sacrificial death on the cross as the ultimate propitiation for our sins, reconciling us to God and satisfying His righteous judgment against sin.
