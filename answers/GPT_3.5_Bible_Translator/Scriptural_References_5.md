## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
One key New Testament verse that indicates a shift in the understanding of Hades is found in Luke 16:19-31, particularly in the story of the rich man and Lazarus. In this parable, Jesus describes Hades as a place of torment for the unrighteous, where the rich man is in agony and separated from God, while Lazarus is comforted in the presence of Abraham.

Another important verse that highlights this shift is Revelation 20:13-14, which speaks of the judgment of the dead and the casting of death and Hades into the lake of fire. This imagery portrays Hades as a place associated with the unrighteous and ultimately destined for destruction.

These passages point to a clearer understanding in the New Testament of Hades as a place of punishment and separation from God for the unrighteous, rather than a neutral place for all the dead.
