The term "begotten" in relation to spiritual rebirth is often understood in the context of John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." In this verse, "begotten" refers to the unique relationship between God the Father and Jesus the Son, highlighting Jesus' divine nature and his special status as the Son of God.

In the context of spiritual rebirth, the term "begotten" emphasizes the idea that through faith in Jesus Christ, believers can experience a new birth or spiritual transformation. This spiritual rebirth is made possible through the work of the Holy Spirit, who regenerates and transforms believers, making them new creations in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). It is through this spiritual rebirth that believers become children of God and partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).

Overall, the term "begotten" in relation to spiritual rebirth underscores the intimate and special relationship believers have with God through faith in Jesus Christ, who is the only begotten Son of God. This spiritual rebirth is not a physical birth, but a transformation of the heart and soul that brings about new life and eternal salvation in Christ.
