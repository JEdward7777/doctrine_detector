When translating the term 'saints' in the Bible, it is important to convey the original meaning of the word while also ensuring clarity for the target audience. One common approach is to translate 'saints' as 'holy ones' or 'set apart ones', as this captures the idea of those who are consecrated or dedicated to God. Another option is to use 'believers' or 'God's people' to emphasize the idea of a community of faithful followers of Christ.
