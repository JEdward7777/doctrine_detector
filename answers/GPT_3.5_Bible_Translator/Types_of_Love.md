## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, love is often portrayed in different forms or expressions, such as brotherly love (philia) and romantic love (eros). These different types of love can be understood in the context of the biblical definition of love, which is agape love.

Agape love is selfless, unconditional, and sacrificial love that seeks the well-being and good of others above oneself. It is the highest form of love that is exemplified by God's love for humanity. This kind of love is what Christians are called to emulate in their relationships with others.

Brotherly love (philia) is a type of love based on friendship and camaraderie. It is characterized by loyalty, mutual affection, and care for one another. In the Bible, brotherly love is often emphasized as believers are encouraged to love one another as brothers and sisters in Christ.

Romantic love (eros) is a type of love that involves passion, attraction, and desire. While eros love is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible, the Song of Solomon provides a beautiful depiction of romantic love within the context of marriage. In Christian relationships, romantic love should be grounded in agape love, with a mutual commitment to honor and respect one another.

Overall, all forms of love can be understood within the biblical definition of love as expressed through agape love. Christians are called to love one another in all relationships, whether it be brotherly love, romantic love, or any other form, with a selfless and sacrificial love that reflects the love of God.
