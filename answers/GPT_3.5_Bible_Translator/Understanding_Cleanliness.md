## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of clean and unclean in the Bible is primarily associated with the Old Testament laws given to the Israelites by God. These laws provided guidelines for ceremonial purity and were intended to set the Israelites apart from the surrounding pagan nations.

In terms of moral purity, the distinction between clean and unclean can serve as a metaphor for the internal state of one's heart and the outward expression of one's actions. Just as the Israelites were to avoid physical impurity in order to maintain their holiness before God, believers are called to pursue moral purity in thoughts, words, and deeds.

Jesus also addressed the issue of purity in the New Testament, emphasizing that true purity comes from within, from a heart that is turned towards God and characterized by love, humility, and righteousness. In Matthew 15:10-20, Jesus teaches that it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the heart.

Therefore, while the Old Testament laws on clean and unclean serve as a helpful backdrop for understanding the importance of maintaining moral purity, Christians are ultimately called to a deeper level of purity that stems from a transformed heart and a life lived in obedience to God's commandments.
