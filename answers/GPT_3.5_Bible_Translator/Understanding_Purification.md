In the Old Testament, purification was an important concept related to ceremonial cleansing from ritual impurity. The Israelites were given various laws and rituals to follow in order to maintain purity before God. These laws were meant to remind the people of their need for holiness and separation from sin.

Purification rituals involved various actions such as washing with water, offering sacrifices, and abstaining from certain activities. These practices were designed to symbolize the need for spiritual cleansing and forgiveness of sins.
