## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Christian theology, an "unholy" life is characterized by actions, attitudes, and behaviors that are contrary to the teachings of the Bible and the nature of God. Some common characteristics of an unholy life include:

1. Sinfulness: Engaging in actions that are considered sinful in the eyes of God, such as lying, stealing, cheating, sexual immorality, greed, and hatred.

2. Disobedience to God's commandments: Ignoring or intentionally disobeying the commandments and teachings of God as found in the Bible.

3. Lack of love and compassion: Failing to show love, kindness, and compassion towards others, including the marginalized, the needy, and those who are different from us.

4. Selfishness and pride: Putting oneself above others, seeking personal gain at the expense of others, and refusing to humble oneself before God and others.

5. Idolatry: Placing anything or anyone above God in one's life, such as material possessions, relationships, or personal desires.

6. Unbelief: Rejecting or questioning the truths of the Christian faith, including the belief in God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.

In society, we can identify these characteristics of an unholy life by observing the prevailing attitudes, values, and behaviors that are contrary to the teachings of Christ. This includes widespread injustice, oppression, violence, discrimination, and disregard for human dignity and worth. As Christians, we are called to be salt and light in the world, standing up for truth, justice, and righteousness, and sharing the love and grace of God with others.
