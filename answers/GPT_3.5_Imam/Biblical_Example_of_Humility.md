## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) is seen as a great example of humility. In the Quran, Jesus is described as a humble servant of Allah who preached love, compassion, and humility to his followers. One example of his humility is in Surah Maryam (Chapter 19, verses 30-33) where Jesus, as an infant, speaks to the people, declaring his prophethood and expressing his humility and gratitude towards Allah.

Another example of humility in Islamic teachings is the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Despite being the leader of the Muslim community and receiving revelations from Allah, the Prophet Muhammad remained humble and demonstrated humility in his interactions with others. He would often help the poor, visit the sick, and sit and eat with his companions, regardless of their social status.

These examples highlight the importance of humility in Islam and serve as a guide for Muslims to strive for humility in their own lives.
