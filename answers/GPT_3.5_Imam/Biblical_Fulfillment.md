## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Bible, the title "King of the Jews" is found in the New Testament in reference to Jesus during his crucifixion (Matthew 27:37, Mark 15:26, Luke 23:38, John 19:19). This title reflects Old Testament prophecies concerning the coming of a messianic king from the line of David who would rule over the people of Israel.

One of the key prophecies related to this title is found in the book of Micah, where it states, "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times" (Micah 5:2). This prophecy foretells the coming of a ruler from Bethlehem who will reign over the people of Israel.

Additionally, the title "King of the Jews" is also connected to the promise made to King David in 2 Samuel 7:12-16, where God promises that one of David's descendants will establish a kingdom that will endure forever. This promise is reiterated in Psalm 89:3-4 and Psalm 132:11.

Therefore, when Jesus is referred to as the "King of the Jews" in the New Testament, it is a fulfillment of these Old Testament prophecies that foretold the coming of a ruler from the line of David who would establish an eternal kingdom. This title highlights Jesus' role as the promised Messiah who would bring salvation and redemption to the people of Israel and to all humanity.
