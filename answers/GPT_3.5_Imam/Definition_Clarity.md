## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Christian context, the term 'adultery' is defined as engaging in sexual relations with someone who is not one's spouse. This definition is largely based on the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament, specifically in Matthew 5:27-28 where he says, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

According to the Bible, adultery is considered a serious sin that goes against the sanctity of marriage as established by God. The seventh commandment in the Old Testament prohibits adultery, as seen in Exodus 20:14, "You shall not commit adultery." 

Adultery is viewed as a violation of the marital covenant and has serious consequences within the Christian faith, including damaging the trust between spouses, causing emotional trauma, and undermining the institution of marriage itself. It is seen as a sin that not only brings harm to individuals involved but also offends God. The Bible emphasizes the importance of fidelity and commitment within marriage, and adultery is seen as a betrayal of those values.
