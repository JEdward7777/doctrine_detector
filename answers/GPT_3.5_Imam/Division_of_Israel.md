One major event that occurred in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign is the division of the kingdom into two separate kingdoms - the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south. This division happened around 930 BC following the reign of Solomon's son, Rehoboam. The northern kingdom of Israel was eventually conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BC, while the southern kingdom of Judah fell to the Babylonians in 586 BC.
