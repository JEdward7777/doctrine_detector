## Question [Eternal Nature of the Son](../../questions/Eternal_Nature_of_the_Son.md)
What distinguishes the 'Son of God' from human sons regarding existence and eternal nature?

## Target answer from notes
Unlike human sons, the Son of God has always existed and was active in the creation of the world.

## Concern to grade by
Emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God.

## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the concept of God having a son is considered inconsistent with the oneness of God and is categorically rejected. In Islam, God is unique and incomparable, and the notion of Him having offspring is deemed as a form of shirk or associating partners with God, which is the gravest sin in Islam.

In the Islamic understanding, God is eternal and self-sufficient, with no need for progeny or offspring. Human sons are created by God and are temporal, mortal beings with a beginning and an end. The concept of a 'Son of God' in Christianity suggests a different relationship between God and Jesus than what Islam teaches. It is important to respect differences in belief while upholding one's own faith.
