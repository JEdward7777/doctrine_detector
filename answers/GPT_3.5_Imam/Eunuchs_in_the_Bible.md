## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Matthew 19:12, Jesus speaks about three types of eunuchs: those who were born as eunuchs, those who were made eunuchs by others, and those who chose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. 

The reference to eunuchs in this verse is not necessarily about physical castration, but rather about those who choose to live a celibate life for the sake of serving God wholeheartedly. This concept of celibacy is related to the idea of detaching oneself from worldly desires and dedicating oneself fully to serving God and His kingdom.

In Islamic teachings, celibacy is not encouraged as it is seen as going against the natural inclination of human beings to marry and procreate. However, there are examples of individuals in Islamic history who chose to remain unmarried and dedicate themselves to serving God and the community. Islam emphasizes the importance of marriage and fulfilling one's marital responsibilities, but also recognizes the value of individuals who choose a life of celibacy for the sake of worship and devotion to God.
