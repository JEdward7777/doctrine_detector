As Muslims, we believe that God's mercy and compassion are central to His interactions with His creations, including His people. The term 'zeal of the Lord' can be understood as God's passion and intensity in caring for His followers, ensuring their well-being, and guiding them towards what is good and righteous.

In Islam, it is emphasized that God is Most Merciful and Most Compassionate (Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim), and His actions are based on love and kindness towards His creation. The concept of 'zeal of the Lord' can be seen in the way God continually calls His people to return to Him, to seek forgiveness, and to strive for righteousness. He is always eager for our well-being and guides us towards the best path in this world and the Hereafter.
