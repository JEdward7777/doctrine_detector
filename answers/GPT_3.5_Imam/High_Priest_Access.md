## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic tradition, the Ark of the Covenant is believed to be a sacred relic from the time of Prophet Musa (Moses), peace be upon him. According to the Quran, Prophet Musa was chosen by Allah to lead the Israelites and received the Torah as guidance for his people.

In Islamic teachings, there is no explicit mention of specific guidelines regarding who was allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant. However, the Ark was considered a sacred object and was revered by the Israelites as a symbol of their covenant with Allah.

It was believed that only the appointed priests and prophets of the Israelites were allowed to approach the Ark, and even then, it was under specific circumstances and with great reverence and purity. The Ark was kept in the Tabernacle or the Temple and was treated with utmost respect and care.

As Muslims, we are taught to respect and revere all the Prophets and the sacred relics associated with them, including the Ark of the Covenant. It is important for believers to approach such symbols with humility, reverence, and the intention of seeking guidance and blessings from Allah.
