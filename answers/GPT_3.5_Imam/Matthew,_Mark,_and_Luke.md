Comment: The response correctly identifies where the names of the twelve disciples can be found in the Bible, but it falls short in accurately listing all the relevant books. The concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings is somewhat addressed but could be improved by providing a more comprehensive list of the specific chapters and verses within the books.
