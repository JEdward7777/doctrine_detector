## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The Sadducees were a Jewish sect during the time of Jesus who did not believe in the concept of the resurrection of the dead. They only believed in the written Torah and rejected the oral traditions followed by other Jewish sects, such as the Pharisees. This belief was based on their literal interpretation of the Torah, which did not explicitly mention resurrection.

In contrast, Christian teaching, as understood by mainstream Christian denominations such as Catholics, Orthodox, and most Protestant groups, affirms the belief in the resurrection of the dead. Christians believe in the bodily resurrection of all humans at the end of time, as part of the final judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom. This belief is based on various teachings in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of the Apostle Paul.

Overall, the Sadduceesâ€™ disbelief in the resurrection contrasts with the central Christian belief in the resurrection, which is seen as a fundamental aspect of Christian eschatology and the hope for eternal life in union with God.
