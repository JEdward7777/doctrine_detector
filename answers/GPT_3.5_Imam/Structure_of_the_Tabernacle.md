## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teaching, we do not have a concept of the tabernacle described in the Old Testament. However, based on general knowledge, the tabernacle consisted of two main sections:

1. The Holy Place: In this section, there were three key items located inside the tabernacle. These were the Lampstand, the Table of Showbread, and the Altar of Incense. The Lampstand was a golden lamp that burned continuously, symbolizing the presence of God. The Table of Showbread held 12 loaves of bread, representing the 12 tribes of Israel. The Altar of Incense was where incense was burned daily as a symbol of prayers ascending to God.

2. The Most Holy Place (Holy of Holies): This section was separated by a veil and contained the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark was a wooden chest covered in gold that held the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, and some manna. This was considered the holiest place in the tabernacle, representing the presence of God among His people. Only the High Priest was allowed to enter this section, and that too, only once a year on the Day of Atonement.
