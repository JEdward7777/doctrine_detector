## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Old Testament, the concept of the temple as God's dwelling place is highlighted in several passages. For example, in 1 Kings 8:10-11, it describes how the glory of God filled the temple of Solomon when it was completed. This signified God's presence among His people.

Similarly, in the New Testament, this concept is continued, but with a shift in understanding. In 1 Corinthians 3:16-17, Paul writes that believers are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in them. This reflects a shift from a physical building to the spiritual understanding that God dwells within His people.

Overall, the temple as God's dwelling is a central concept in both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the presence of God among His people and the importance of living lives that reflect His holiness and glory.
