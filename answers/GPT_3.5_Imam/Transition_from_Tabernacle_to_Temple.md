## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle because it served as a temporary place of worship until the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. According to Islamic belief, the tabernacle was a place of worship built by Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) as commanded by Allah. The Tabernacle was used for centuries by the Israelites until the Temple was built by Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him). After the construction of the Temple, the tabernacle was no longer needed for worship purposes.

Comment: The response accurately addresses the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple by stating that the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle when the temple was built by Solomon in Jerusalem. However, there is a concern with the inclusion of Islamic belief and terminology in the explanation, which may not align with a Christian specific worldview. It is important to maintain a consistent perspective rooted in Christianity when discussing religious practices and beliefs related to the tabernacle and temple.
