## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic eschatology, the figure often identified as the ultimate Antichrist is known as Al-Masih ad-Dajjal. Dajjal is described as a false messiah who will appear towards the end of times, spreading corruption and deception on earth. Muslims are warned to be wary of him, as he will possess great powers of deception and will lead many astray. It is believed that before the Day of Judgment, Prophet Jesus (Isa) will return to defeat the Dajjal and establish justice on earth.

Comment: The response provides a clear identification of the ultimate Antichrist figure in Christian eschatology as described in the book of Revelation. The concern for being aware of eschatological figures to help Christians prepare for challenges in faith is addressed. However, there is room for improvement by further explaining the significance of Jesus' defeat of the Antichrist in Christian belief and its implications for believers' faith and ultimate victory.
