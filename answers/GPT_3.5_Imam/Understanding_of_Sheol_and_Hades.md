How do the concepts of Sheol and Hades differ in the context of the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous?

## Target answer from notes
In biblical context, Sheol and Hades refer to a place of the dead but were understood differently over time. Initially, both represented a neutral place where all the dead awaited judgment. However, in the New Testament, Hades becomes associated primarily with the unrighteous, contrasting with 'Abraham's side' or 'paradise' for the righteous.

## Concern to grade by
Understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death.

## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic belief, we do not specifically refer to Sheol and Hades as they are understood in Christian theology. However, we do believe in the concept of the afterlife and the ultimate destination of the righteous and the unrighteous.

In Islamic belief, the righteous are promised paradise (Jannah) where they will be rewarded with eternal bliss and closeness to Allah. On the other hand, the unrighteous will face punishment in Hellfire (Jahannam) as a result of their deeds and rejection of faith.

It is important for Muslims to strive to live a righteous life, following the teachings of Islam, to attain paradise in the afterlife. The concept of accountability, judgment, and the ultimate reward or punishment in the afterlife is a central tenet of Islamic belief.
