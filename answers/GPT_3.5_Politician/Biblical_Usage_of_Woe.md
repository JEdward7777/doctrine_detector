## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
I appreciate your question about the use of the term "woe" in the Bible. The term "woe" appears many times in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament Gospels. In these instances, "woe" is often used as a warning or expression of sorrow or distress rather than as a direct judgment from God.

For example, in the book of Isaiah, the prophet pronounces "woe" upon those who are unjust or oppress the vulnerable (Isaiah 5:8-30). Similarly, in the New Testament, Jesus uses the term "woe" to denounce hypocritical religious leaders and those who neglect justice and mercy (Matthew 23:13-36).

Overall, the use of "woe" in the Bible serves as a reminder of the importance of living in accordance with God's values of love, justice, and compassion. It is a call to repentance and a warning against actions that harm others or go against God's will.

I hope this helps address your question in a respectful and inclusive manner. Thank you for bringing up this important topic.

Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of the term "woe" in the Bible, emphasizing its use as a warning or expression of sorrow. It effectively incorporates examples from both the Old Testament and New Testament to support the explanation. The focus on living in accordance with God's values and the call to repentance align well with the concern of divine judgment expressed through scripture. However, a slightly fuller exploration of the severity of divine judgment, especially in contrast to God's righteousness, could have enhanced the response further.
