The tabernacle had two main sections: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. 

In the Holy Place, you would find the Table of Showbread, the Golden Lampstand, and the Altar of Incense. 

In the Most Holy Place, also known as the Holy of Holies, was the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments.

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 70

Comment: The response provided a good overview of the main sections of the tabernacle and mentioned some significant components. However, it lacked some key details such as the specific items in the Holy Place and the importance of the Ark of the Covenant in the Most Holy Place. Additionally, while the response touched on respecting beliefs and practices, it did not directly address the concern about the significance of the components in worship as viewed through a Christian-specific worldview.
