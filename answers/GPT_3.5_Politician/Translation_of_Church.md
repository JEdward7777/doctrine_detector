Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides appropriate translations that uphold the inclusivity and universality of the Church as a gathering of all believers. However, while the translations are inclusive, there is room for improvement in explicitly connecting them to the concept of the Church being a diverse and unified body of believers, which is a key aspect of the church's inclusive nature from a Christian perspective.
