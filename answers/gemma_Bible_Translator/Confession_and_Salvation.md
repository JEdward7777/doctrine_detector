## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Confessing that Jesus is Lord is essential for salvation according to Paul's writings.**

Paul emphasizes this truth in several passages:

* **Romans 10:9:** "If you confess that Jesus is Lord, you will be saved."
* **Ephesians 2:8:** "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast."
* **1 Corinthians 15:1-2:** "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; it is the essence of your faith. But God has raised him from the dead."

**Paul clearly teaches that salvation is a gift from God, received by faith in Jesus Christ.** Confessing that Jesus is Lord is an integral part of this faith.

**When you confess that Jesus is Lord, you are:**

* Recognizing his deity and authority
* Submitting your life to his lordship
* Accepting his sacrifice as payment for your sins
* Experiencing forgiveness and reconciliation with God

**Therefore, confessing that Jesus is Lord is not merely a mental assent or intellectual belief, but a vital expression of saving faith.**

**Paul's writings emphasize that salvation is not based on our works or merit, but solely on God's grace through Christ.** Confessing Jesus as Lord is a response to God's grace and a demonstration of faith in his salvation.
