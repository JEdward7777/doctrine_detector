Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of what it means to be one of the 'people of God' in the Old Testament, emphasizing the covenant relationship, belonging to God's family, distinct identity, responsibility and privilege, God's protection and guidance, and the fulfillment of God's plan. However, the comment given does not fully address the concern regarding the understanding of the covenant relationship God established with Israel. More specific references to the covenant promises made to Israel, such as the Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants, could further enhance the answer.
