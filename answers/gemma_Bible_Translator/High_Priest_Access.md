## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Only two individuals were ever permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Moses**

* God specifically commanded Moses to approach the ark and consult with it during times of crisis and decision-making (Exodus 24:1-4).

**2. The High Priest**

* In the later prophetic periods, the High Priest was permitted to approach the ark once a year on the Day of Atonement to perform sacrifices and prayers (Leviticus 16:1-3). 

**Neither the common people nor any other individual was permitted to approach the ark without incurring severe punishment.** The proximity of the ark was associated with immense power and glory, and access was strictly limited to those whom God had specifically designated.

Comment: This response is comprehensive and accurate in stating that only the high priest could approach the ark, specifically once a year on the Day of Atonement. It also addresses the concern by recognizing the significance of the high priest in the Israelites' relationship with God and the covenant. The addition of Moses as another individual permitted to approach the ark in specific circumstances adds depth to the understanding of the topic.
