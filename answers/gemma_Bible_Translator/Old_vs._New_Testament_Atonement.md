## Difference between Old Testament and New Testament Understanding of Atonement:

**Old Testament:**

* Emphasis on **sacrifice and atonement through blood** as a temporary covering for sin.
* Focused on the need for **ritual purity and cleansing** of sin.
* Sacrifice was seen as a temporary atoning action, requiring repeated offerings.
* Emphasis on the **prophetic concept of a future perfect sacrifice** that would ultimately atone for sin (e.g., Genesis 3:21, Hebrews 10:1-18).

**New Testament:**

* Emphasis on **Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and complete atonement** for sin.
* Focuses on the idea of **redemption through Christ's blood** as the new and final atoning sacrifice.
* Highlights Christ's sacrifice as a **completed and finished work**, offering forgiveness and reconciliation with God.
* Emphasizes the importance of **grace and forgiveness** in God's redemption plan.

**Key differences:**

* **Nature of atonement:** Old Testament sacrifices were temporary coverings, while the New Testament emphasizes Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and complete atonement.
* **Focus:** Old Testament emphasizes ritual purification, while the New Testament emphasizes forgiveness and reconciliation through Christ's sacrifice.
* **Completion:** Old Testament sacrifices required repeated offerings, while the New Testament views Christ's sacrifice as a completed and finished work.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The Old Testament hints at the future fulfillment of the sacrifice through prophecies like the one in Hebrews 10:1-18.
* The New Testament interpretation of atonement is built upon the foundation of the Old Testament sacrificial system.
* Both testaments point to God's great love for humanity and his desire to reconcile with us through Christ's sacrifice.
