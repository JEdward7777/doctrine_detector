Recognizing historical context and significance of the term 'Christian'.

## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The earliest references to Christians as a group appear in non-canonical sources from the late first century AD. The New Testament itself does not contain the first instances of the term "Christian."

**First known references:**

* **Tacitus (c. 98 AD)**: Roman historian who mentions "Christians, who by their worship of a remarkable savior Christ, are hated by the Jews."
* **Josephus (c. 100 AD)**: Jewish historian who occasionally uses the term "Christians" in his writings.

**Within the New Testament:**

* The term "Christian" is not explicitly used by the apostles or other New Testament writers to describe Jesus' followers.
* Early Christians were primarily referred to as "followers of Christ," "believers," or "brethren."

**Origins of the term:**

* The term "Christian" is believed to derive from the Greek word "christianos," meaning "follower" or "imitator."
* It was likely first used by non-Christians to describe those who adhered to Christ's teachings.

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a well-researched and detailed explanation of the origins and early usage of the term "Christian," citing historical sources such as Tacitus and Josephus. It accurately explains that the term was likely not used by Jesus' followers themselves but was derived from the Greek word "christianos." However, it does not directly address the concern regarding the historical context and significance of the term 'Christian' in relation to Antioch.
