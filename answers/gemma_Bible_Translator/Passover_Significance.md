## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The celebration of Passover signifies for Christians the fulfillment of God's promise of redemption through Christ, who is the ultimate Passover lamb.**

In the Old Testament, Passover commemorates the Israelites' liberation from slavery in Egypt through the sacrifice of a lamb. God instructed them to mark their doors with the blood of the lamb to spare them from the angel of death.

In Christianity, Jesus Christ becomes the ultimate Passover lamb. His sacrifice, once for all, atones for the sins of the world and brings salvation to believers. His blood, shed on the cross, becomes the new and eternal Passover, offering forgiveness and redemption.

**Therefore, celebrating Passover is a reminder for Christians:**

* **Jesus' sacrifice fulfills God's redemptive plan.**
* **He is the true Passover lamb who takes away the sin of the world.**
* **His blood is the source of forgiveness and eternal life.**

The parallels between the Passover celebration and Christ's sacrifice highlight the central message of Christianity: salvation through faith in the Son of God.
