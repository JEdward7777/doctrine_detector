## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Hope in God differs from merely wishing for something in several significant ways:**

**1. Basis and Source:**

* **Hope in God** is founded on God's character and promises. It rests on the reliability of his Word and the steadfastness of his love.
* **Wishing** is based on human desires and expectations, which can be fickle and unreliable.

**2. Duration and Persistence:**

* **Hope in God** is enduring and persistent, regardless of circumstances. It remains even when faced with adversity, trials, and temptations.
* **Wishing** is often temporary and conditional, fading when circumstances change or desires are not met.

**3. Confidence and Assurance:**

* **Hope in God** brings confidence and assurance because it is rooted in God's faithfulness and promises. God never fails those who hope in him.
* **Wishing** often leads to feelings of uncertainty and disappointment because it is based on human efforts and cannot guarantee outcomes.

**4. Action and Obedience:**

* **Hope in God** motivates believers to action and obedience. Knowing God's love compels us to love others and live lives that please him.
* **Wishing** typically leads to passive acceptance of circumstances or wishful thinking without any significant action.

**5. Connection to God:**

* **Hope in God** fosters a deep connection to God. It reveals God's character and purpose for our lives, drawing us closer to him.
* **Wishing** remains focused on our own desires and does not necessarily lead to a deeper understanding or relationship with God.

**Biblical Examples:**

* **Hope in God** is exemplified in the lives of Abraham, who hoped for a promised land, and David, who hoped for God's redemption.
* **Wishing** is evident in the Pharisees' futile attempts to earn salvation through their own efforts.

**Conclusion:**

Hope in God is a supernatural gift from God that transcends human wishing. It is based on God's character, endures through trials, brings confidence, motivates action, and fosters a deep connection to the Almighty.
