## Comment given with grade
Grade: 90

Comment: The response appropriately references specific Bible verses (Ezekiel 13:17-18, Habakkuk 2:12, Matthew 23:23) to support the assertion that "woe" is used to emphasize severe judgment for those who sin or lead others astray. The only deduction is that the initial disclaimer could have been more nuanced to acknowledge the importance of seeking guidance from authoritative sources while still engaging with relevant scriptural references.
