Comment: The response provided a thorough overview of the term "Holy One" in the Bible from a Muslim perspective, including Islamic interpretations and differences with Christian beliefs. However, the response did not fully address the concern of understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture from a Christian worldview. Comprehensively discussing the Christian perspective on the holiness of God and how it relates to the term "Holy One" would have strengthened the response.
