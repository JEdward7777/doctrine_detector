## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The term 'foreordain' is not explicitly mentioned in Islamic teachings.** However, the concept of predetermination is addressed in Islamic theology through various terms such as 'qisma' (predestination) and 'taqdir' (divine decree).

**Both 'qisma' and 'taqdir' suggest that Allah has predetermined the fates of individuals and events.** This means that:

* **Actions have been assigned:** Allah has predetermined what actions will lead to what consequences.
* **Events are fixed:** Certain events, like the rise and fall of empires, are preordained by Allah.
* **Free will exists:** While our actions are predetermined, our intentions and choices remain free.

**The Islamic concept of predetermination differs from the Christian concept of predestination in several ways:**

* **Islamic belief in free will:** Muslims believe that humans have free will, while Christians believe that God has predetermined both our actions and our destinies.
* **Emphasis on human responsibility:** In Islam, the emphasis is on human responsibility for actions and their consequences, while in Christianity, the emphasis is on God's sovereignty and grace.
* **Nature of predetermination:** Islamic teachings suggest that predetermination is related to Allah's wisdom and justice, while Christian teachings often emphasize God's love and mercy.

**In summary, the term 'foreordain' is not directly used in Islamic teachings, but the concept of predetermination is acknowledged through terms like 'qisma' and 'taqdir,' with emphasis on Allah's decree and human responsibility.**
