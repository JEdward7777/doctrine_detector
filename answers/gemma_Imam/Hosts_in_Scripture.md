## Comment given with grade
Grade: 70

Comment: The response provided a solid explanation of the term 'hosts' in the Islamic context, highlighting the different meanings and implications within Islamic scriptures. However, the grade is slightly lower due to not directly addressing the concern raised regarding spiritual warfare and divine authority from a Christian perspective. To improve, it would have been beneficial to connect the discussion on 'hosts' in Islamic scriptures to how an understanding of spiritual warfare and divine authority influences prayer and battles in a Christian worldview.
