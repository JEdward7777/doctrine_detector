Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers by highlighting the practice of believers meeting in someone's home to pray and discuss scripture. The concern is addressed within a Christian worldview of encouraging community and support among believers. The deduction in points is due to the initial response pointing out an inaccurate premise in the question, which is not directly relevant to the concern at hand.
