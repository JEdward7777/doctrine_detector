## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus is not described as the image of God in Islam.**

The Islamic faith believes that Allah is unique and incomparable, and that there is no likeness or image of him. This principle is known as "tawhid" and is a fundamental belief of Islam.

Therefore, the concept of Jesus as the image of God is not recognized or accepted in Islamic theology.
