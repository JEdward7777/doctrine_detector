## Grade
90.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 90

Comment: The response correctly connects the Old Testament practice of the Nazirite vow with the New Testament figure of John the Baptist to highlight biblical continuity. The concern is addressed effectively, and the reasoning is well-supported by biblical evidence. The only deduction is due to the omission of acknowledging the possibility of John the Baptist being a Nazirite, as there is no definitive evidence either confirming or denying this assertion.
