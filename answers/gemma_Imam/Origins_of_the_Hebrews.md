**The Hebrews descended from Abraham, the patriarch of the Jewish people.** According to Islamic belief, Abraham is a prophet and ancestor of both the Muslims and the Jews. The Bible tells us that Abraham was the son of Terah and his wife Sarah. He was chosen by God to be the father of a great nation, and through him, the Islamic faith and the Jewish people were born.
