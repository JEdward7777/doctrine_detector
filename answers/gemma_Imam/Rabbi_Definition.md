## Comment given with grade
Grade: 40

Comment: The response correctly defines the term 'Rabbi' in its Jewish context but fails to address the concern about understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. The response missed an opportunity to provide insight from a Christian worldview on how rabbinic teaching may have influenced or been referenced in the New Testament. Further explanation linking the Jewish concept of 'Rabbi' to Christian teachings would have strengthened the response.
