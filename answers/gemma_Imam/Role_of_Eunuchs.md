Comment: The response effectively applies a Christian worldview by highlighting the idea that God can use individuals regardless of their physical state for His purposes. It emphasizes the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, aligning well with the concern provided. The only slight deduction is due to the initial disclaimer about discussing sensitive topics, which, while important, slightly detracts from the overall strength of the Christian worldview perspective.
