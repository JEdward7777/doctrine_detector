**1. Divine Inspiration:**

* Jesus is seen as the spoken word of God, conveying the will and message of Allah (or God) to humanity.
* His words hold immense significance and authority, as they are believed to be inspired by the Holy Spirit.

**2. Divine Presence:**

* The title 'Word of God' suggests that Jesus is a manifestation or embodiment of the divine essence.
* His presence and words are seen as a tangible manifestation of Allah's love and power.
