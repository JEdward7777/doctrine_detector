Comment: The response effectively connects the theological concept of Jesus as the propitiation for sins with specific biblical references, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective. The only slight deduction is for not directly addressing the concern regarding interpretations of religious texts from other faiths, but the clarity and depth of the explanation of the Christian beliefs still warrant a high grade.
