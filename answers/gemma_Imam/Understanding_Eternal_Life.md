## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Bible, eternal life is primarily understood as a gift from God, not as something that can be inherited through human actions.** The central message of Christianity revolves around the belief that Jesus Christ died on the cross as a perfect sacrifice for our sins, and rose from the dead, offering eternal life to all who believe in him.

**Relevant Biblical passages:**

* **John 3:16:** "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life."
* **Romans 6:23:** "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
* **1 Corinthians 15:20:** "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was raised again for our justification."

**The Bible teaches that:**

* Eternal life is a gift from God, not something that can be earned or achieved through human merit.
* Faith in Jesus Christ is the only way to receive eternal life.
* Eternal life begins the moment a person believes in Jesus Christ.
* Eternal life is not just about avoiding physical death, but about experiencing a new life in Christ with spiritual and eternal significance.

**The Islamic perspective:**

Islam and Christianity share some similarities in their beliefs about God and the afterlife, but there are also significant differences. Islamic teachings emphasize submission to Allah's will and following Islamic laws as a path to salvation. While faith in Jesus Christ is not explicitly accepted in Islam, the concept of believing in God and following his teachings is fundamental to both religions.

It is crucial to have a correct understanding of this central aspect of Christian faith for spiritual assurance and growth.
