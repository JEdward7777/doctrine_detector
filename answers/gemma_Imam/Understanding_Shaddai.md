Comment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the meaning and usage of the Hebrew term 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament. It accurately describes the term as conveying faithfulness and trustworthiness in relation to God, angels, and humans. The examples provided from Psalms further demonstrate the significance of 'Shaddai' in portraying God's unwavering nature. However, the response does not directly address the concern of understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture, which is the main focus of a Christian worldview. A deeper exploration of how 'Shaddai' specifically reflects God's nature and attributes based on biblical passages would have improved the response.
