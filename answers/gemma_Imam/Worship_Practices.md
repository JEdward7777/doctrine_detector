Grade: 95

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the potential modern idols that can distract Christians from prioritizing their relationship with God. It aligns well with the Christian worldview and emphasizes the importance of examining one's life to ensure proper devotion to God. The deductive points are minimal as it does not directly address the concern by refuting any misconceptions outright, but overall the response is strong from a Christian perspective.
