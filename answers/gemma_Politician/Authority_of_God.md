## Comment given with grade
Grade: 20

Comment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of God's authority as signified by the term "Yahweh of hosts." However, the response fails to engage with the concern that understanding God's authority can deepen faith and trust in His omnipotence, which is a significant aspect when discussing theological concepts from a Christian worldview. Adding a reflection on the importance of recognizing and trusting in God's authority would have enhanced the response.
