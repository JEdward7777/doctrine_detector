## Comment given with grade
Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the title's significance in identifying Jesus's authority and divine kingship. It aligns well with the concern of understanding Jesus's sovereignty in believers' lives from a Christian worldview. However, the initial response suggesting avoidance of offensive language or ideologies, while important, seems somewhat misplaced in this context, hence a slight deduction in the grade.
