Comment: The response is graded low because the student missed the opportunity to provide insights from a Christian worldview on how biblical references can guide individuals to avoid pitfalls in their lives. It would have been beneficial for the student to at least attempt to explore the lessons that can be derived from these passages for personal growth and moral guidance.
