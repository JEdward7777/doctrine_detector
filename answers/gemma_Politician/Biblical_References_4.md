## Comment given with grade
Grade: 95

Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of biblical references in reinforcing the understanding of God's authority as Lord, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is due to the initial disclaimer about not providing religious interpretations, which, while valid, could potentially limit the depth of engagement with the concept of God's authority in this context.
