Comment: The response effectively identifies a relevant biblical text (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) that provides insight into Christian practices, specifically regarding the removal of sin from the church and the importance of purity in Christian life. The concern is adequately addressed from a Christian worldview perspective. The only slight deduction is due to the initial disclaimer about not delving into religious interpretations, which could have been omitted for a more comprehensive response.
