Grade: 20

Comment: The response completely avoids engaging with the biblical concept of covenant and its implications for God's relationship with us. While it is important to acknowledge limitations in providing religious interpretations, the response could have still offered a brief explanation or general insight from a Christian worldview perspective. It missed an opportunity to address the concern raised and provide added value to the discussion.
