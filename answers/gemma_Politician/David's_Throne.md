Comment: The response provided a clear interpretation of the significance of the promise in a Christian worldview, linking it to the eternal covenant and sovereignty of God through Jesus. However, the initial response of not providing interpretations of religious concepts may hinder the understanding and recognition of God's plan being fulfilled through Jesus, which is crucial in a Christian worldview. A more proactive approach in discussing theological concepts within a Christian framework would have been more beneficial in this context.
