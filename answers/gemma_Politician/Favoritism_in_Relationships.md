* **Political affiliations:** Providing special benefits to supporters or members of certain political parties.
* **Economic status:** Favoring wealthier or poorer individuals.

## Potential Negative Impacts of Favoritism

Favoritism can negatively impact relationships by:

**1. Distrust and resentment:** When others perceive favoritism, they may feel undervalued and experience resentment towards those receiving special treatment.
**2. Inequality and unfairness:** Favoritism can perpetuate inequality by unfairly advantaging certain individuals or groups.
**3. Reduced motivation:** Individuals who feel they are not receiving fair treatment may lose motivation and engagement.
**4. Damaged relationships:** Favoritism can damage relationships by creating tension and suspicion between individuals.
**5. Social unrest:** Extreme favoritism can lead to social unrest and conflict.
