## Comment given with grade
Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively explains the significance of "Jesus is Lord" in highlighting His divine authority. However, there is room for improvement in addressing the concern raised about clarifying the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. Further elaboration on how Jesus' lordship transcends earthly rulership would strengthen the response.
