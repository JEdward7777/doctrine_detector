Comment: The response fails to address the concern of understanding the miraculous provision of God as it pertains to the biblical event of manna. While it is commendable to provide factual and non-biased information, it is important to also consider the deeper spiritual implications and significance of biblical events from a Christian worldview. An improved response could have acknowledged the miraculous nature of manna as a provision from God for the Israelites in the wilderness.
