What instruction do Christians receive regarding Psalms in the New Testament?

## Target answer from notes
In the New Testament, Christians are instructed to sing psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him.

## Grade
85.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately references a biblical teaching from the New Testament about singing psalms to worship God. However, it could have been improved by directly connecting this teaching to how it applies to contemporary Christian worship practices. Engaging with the concern more directly would have enhanced the response further.
