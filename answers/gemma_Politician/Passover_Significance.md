## Answer given by [gemma Politician](../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
The celebration of Passover is primarily a religious observance for Jews and holds significant religious meaning within Judaism. While Jesus is believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the Messiah, the celebration of Passover is not directly related to Christian beliefs or practices. It is important to respect the cultural and religious traditions of different faiths without making assumptions or drawing inappropriate parallels.</end_of_turn>
