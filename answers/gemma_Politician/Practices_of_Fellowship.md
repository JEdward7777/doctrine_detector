## Comment given with grade
Grade: 80

Comment: The response provided a good overview of how early Christians expressed their fellowship, emphasizing the importance of listening to God's Word, praying together, sharing belongings, and eating meals together. However, it did not directly address the concern about how recognizing these practices can help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other. A stronger response would have connected the early Christian practices to the concern and provided insights on how modern Christians can apply similar principles in their own fellowship.
