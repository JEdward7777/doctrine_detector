Comment: The response correctly acknowledges Matthias as the replacement for Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, demonstrating an understanding of the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. This aligns with a Christian worldview perspective on the importance of succession in carrying forward Jesus' teachings and mission. However, the response could have provided more depth or context to strengthen the connection to Christian beliefs.
