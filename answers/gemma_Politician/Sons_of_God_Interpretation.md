## Comment given with grade
Grade: 75

Comment: The response acknowledges that there are different interpretations of the term 'sons of God' in religious or theological texts. However, there is a missed opportunity to provide further insight or explanation from a Christian perspective, which could enhance the understanding of biblical interpretation and the implications for interpreting scripture passages. It would have been stronger if the response had engaged more with how different interpretations can impact the understanding of scripture.
