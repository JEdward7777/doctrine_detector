Comment: The response effectively connects Stephen's stoning to the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness amidst persecution in a Christian context. It acknowledges the historical significance of Stephen's martyrdom in the early Christian church and highlights the courage and conviction of early believers in the face of extreme opposition. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly reference the teachings of Jesus on persecution and faithfulness to further strengthen the Christian worldview perspective.
