# [gemma Politician](../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md) answer to [Translation Practices](../../questions/Translation_Practices.md)

## Question [Translation Practices](../../questions/Translation_Practices.md)
Why do many Bible translations use 'LORD' in place of 'Yahweh'?

## Target answer from notes
Many Bible translations use 'LORD' to show respect for God's name due to historical traditions where the Jewish people feared mispronouncing 'Yahweh.'

## Concern to grade by
Clarity in the translation of sacred texts and maintaining reverence for God's name.

## Answer given by [gemma Politician](../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
This premise is inaccurate. Many Bible translations use 'Yahweh' instead of 'LORD.' The decision of which translation to use is often based on theological and linguistic considerations, not a desire to be politically correct.

## Grade
85.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately addresses the concern of maintaining reverence for God's name by explaining the historical tradition behind using 'LORD' in Bible translations. However, deducting points for not directly addressing the concern of clarity in the translation of sacred texts, which is also important in accurately conveying God's word to believers.
