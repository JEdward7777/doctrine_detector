## Comment given with grade
Grade: 30

Comment: The response did not adequately engage with the concern of exploring different interpretations of biblical terms to deepen understanding. Instead, it emphasized the importance of respecting the specific meaning of theological terms without providing any further insights or analysis. There was a missed opportunity to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concept in question and its implications within a Christian worldview.
