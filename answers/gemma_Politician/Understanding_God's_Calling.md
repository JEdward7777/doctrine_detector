## Comment given with grade
Grade: 65

Comment: The response acknowledging the concept of being 'called' by God is aligned with a Christian worldview that sees individuals as chosen for a higher purpose. However, the initial response that refrains from discussing religious beliefs or interpretations falls short in addressing the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith. It missed an opportunity to elaborate on how this concept of being called by God impacts one's understanding of personal purpose in the Christian faith.
