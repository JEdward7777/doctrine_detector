Comment: The response provided lacks a Christian-specific worldview by not addressing the theological significance of guilt in relation to disobeying God. Understanding guilt as a moral transgression against God is essential for recognizing the need for repentance and forgiveness in Christian belief. Therefore, the response falls short in providing a comprehensive Christian perspective on the concept of guilt.
