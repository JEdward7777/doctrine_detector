## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The biblical account of the Israelites being commanded to celebrate Passover every year is a religious belief and does not reflect historical or archaeological evidence. As an atheist scholar, I do not subscribe to religious doctrines or historical narratives as presented in religious texts.

The celebration of Passover is a cultural and religious tradition that holds significance within Judaism and other religious communities. Its origins and significance should be understood within the context of their religious beliefs and practices, rather than as historical facts verified by secular sources.</end_of_turn>

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 20

Comment: The response completely dismisses the biblical account of Passover and fails to appreciate the significance of remembrance in Christian faith. As a Christian, it is important to recognize the biblical events and their spiritual significance in shaping religious beliefs and practices. This response's atheist perspective does not align with a Christian worldview.
