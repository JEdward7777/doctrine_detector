## Grade
40.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 40

Comment: The response provided a relevant biblical example regarding blessings in Genesis 1:22. However, the concern was about illustrating blessings in scripture, and the response failed to engage with this, instead deflecting to a different approach. It missed the opportunity to analyze or delve deeper into the biblical concept of blessings, thus resulting in a lower grade.
