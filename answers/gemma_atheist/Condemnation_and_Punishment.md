## Impact of Matthew 12:7 on Punishment:

**1. Redefinition of Sin and Condemnation:**

* Matthew 12:7 challenges the culturally-embedded association between punishment and sin as retribution. 
* It emphasizes that the scribes of that time condemned people based on external behavior, while Jesus highlighted the internal motive of the heart. 
* This shift in focus encourages a more holistic understanding of condemnation, encompassing thoughts, intentions, and actions.

**2. Contextualizing Punishment:**

* The passage suggests that punishment should be understood in its social and political context. 
* Jesus' critique of the scribes shows how punishment can be used as a tool of control and oppression rather than as a means of spiritual redemption.

**3. Implications for Modern Justice Systems:**

* The redefinition of sin and condemnation in Matthew 12:7 challenges the traditional retributive model of justice, where punishment is seen as the only appropriate response to wrongdoing. 
* This perspective encourages a more restorative approach to justice that focuses on healing and reconciliation.


## Impact of Psalms 34:22 on Punishment:

**1. Emphasis on Mercy and Forgiveness:**

* Psalm 34:22 emphasizes God's forgiveness and mercy as central to his character. 
* This contradicts the common association between punishment and divine retribution, suggesting that forgiveness and compassion are foundational to God's justice.

**2. Understanding God's Justice:**

* The psalm reveals that God's justice is not synonymous with punishment. 
* It highlights the restoration of the afflicted and the vindication of the oppressed as key aspects of God's justice.

**3. Implications for Understanding God's Actions:**

* By emphasizing forgiveness and mercy, Psalm 34:22 encourages a nuanced understanding of God's actions, suggesting that his justice is not limited to punishment but extends to healing and restoration.

**Conclusion:**

Both Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 offer perspectives that challenge the culturally-retrenched association between punishment and condemnation. They advocate for a more holistic understanding of justice that emphasizes forgiveness, restoration, and compassion alongside retribution.
