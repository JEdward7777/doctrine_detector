## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The Babylonian Captivity (586-539 BCE)**

Following King Solomon's death, Israel experienced a period of political and military decline. Around 586 BCE, the Babylonian Empire conquered Jerusalem and exiled the Jewish population to Babylonia. This event had a profound impact on Israel's history, leading to the Babylonian Captivity and the subsequent diaspora of the Jewish people.

Comment: The response provides a good overview of the division of Israel into two kingdoms after King Solomon's death, setting the stage for the Babylonian Captivity. However, it would have been helpful to elaborate on the spiritual implications of this division, such as how it impacted the relationship between God and His people and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about the consequences of Israel's disobedience.
