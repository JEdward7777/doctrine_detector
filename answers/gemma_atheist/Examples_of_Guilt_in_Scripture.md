Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the Biblical examples provided and how they relate to the concepts of justice and innocence. However, the response falls short in connecting these examples to the need for divine judgment from a Christian worldview perspective. Further elaboration on how these examples highlight the role of divine judgment in the context of guilt and innocence would strengthen the analysis.
