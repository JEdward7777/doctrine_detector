## Grade
20.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 20

Comment: The response received a low grade because it dismisses the Christian belief in the fruits of the Holy Spirit and the concept of godly characteristics without engaging with the topic from a Christian worldview. It is important to consider and respect the beliefs and teachings of Christianity when addressing a concern related to cultivating godly characteristics.
