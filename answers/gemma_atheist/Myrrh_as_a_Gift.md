## Comment given with grade
Grade: 65

Comment: The response accurately conveys the symbolism of myrrh as representing Jesus' future suffering and death, tying it to his role as the Messiah. However, the initial response avoiding commenting on the historical existence of Jesus due to a limitation to secular analysis does not fully engage with the Christian worldview, which emphasizes the importance of acknowledging Jesus as a central figure in history. Engaging with Jesus' historical existence from a Christian perspective would enhance the understanding of the symbolism of the gifts given to Him.
