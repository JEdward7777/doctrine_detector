## Question [Origin of the Term](../../questions/Origin_of_the_Term.md)
Where were Jesus' followers first called 'Christians'?

## Target answer from notes
Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in the city of Antioch.

## Concern to grade by
Recognizing historical context and significance of the term 'Christian'.

## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The earliest reference to Christians as a collective appears in non-canonical writings around 100 AD, several decades after Jesus' death and resurrection. The term likely emerged as a way to describe the followers of Jesus within the Roman Empire, and its usage was likely influenced by the existing political and cultural landscape.

The first known instances of the term "Christian" in historical records come from non-Christian sources such as the Roman historian Tacitus and the Jewish historian Josephus. These early references suggest that the term was used to describe the followers of Jesus as a distinct group with a unique identity.

## Grade
60.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 60

Comment: The response accurately recognizes that Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in the city of Antioch. However, it lacks depth in exploring the historical context and significance of the term 'Christian' beyond this specific event. A stronger response would have provided more historical context and delved into the cultural and religious implications of being called a "Christian" in the early Christian community.
