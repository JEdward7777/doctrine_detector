Comment: The response acknowledges the Christian belief that God can use anyone, regardless of their physical state, to fulfill His purposes. It aligns with the concern of understanding the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, emphasizing that God's plans are not limited by physical or social status. However, the initial response shows a reluctance to engage in discussions involving divine plans or religious beliefs, which may limit the depth of the theological analysis.
