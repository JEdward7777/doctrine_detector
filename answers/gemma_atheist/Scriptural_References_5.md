## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**New Testament verses indicating a shift in understanding of Hades:**

**1. 1 Corinthians 15:55:** "Flesh is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory."

* This verse suggests that Hades is not a neutral place for all the dead, but rather a state of corruption and dishonor.

**2. Revelation 2:11:** "Whoever overcomes the fear of death will judge the dead."

* This verse implies that those who are not victorious over death are condemned to judge alongside the unrighteous.

**3. Revelation 20:14-15:** "Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony to Jesus, and the souls of the martyrs, who had not worshipped the beast or its image. They had reigned with Christ a thousand years. The sea was turned to blood, and the stars were fallen from heaven to the earth because of the abomination of those who dwell in Hades."

* This passage depicts Hades as a place of punishment and rebellion.

**4. 2 Peter 2:4:** "For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell (Hades), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be kept until judgment."

* This verse suggests that Hades is a place of punishment for those who have sinned.

**Cultural Considerations:**

* These verses must be interpreted within their cultural and literary contexts. The ancient Greek understanding of Hades was influenced by pagan beliefs and practices.
* Early Christian writers may have borrowed and adapted these pagan ideas to fit their own theological frameworks.
* It is important to avoid making ethnocentric assumptions about the afterlife based on these verses.
