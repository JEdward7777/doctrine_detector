## Comment given with grade
Grade: 40

Comment: The response correctly states that Jesus did not give in to Satan's temptations and highlights the importance of his obedience to God. However, the responder's refusal to comment on Jesus' historical existence from a secular perspective limits their understanding of the significance of Jesus' actions in resisting temptation. Understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation is not solely a moral or spiritual model but also a historical event with broader implications for faith and worldview.
