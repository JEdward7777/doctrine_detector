Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides appropriate translations for 'saints' that align with the concern of using inclusive language by suggesting terms like 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus' that encompass all believers without specifying particular Christian groups. It also takes into consideration the ethical values associated with sainthood and emphasizes the importance of accurate and culturally sensitive translation. However, it could have further expanded on how to convey the broader ethical principles and values of sainthood to a diverse audience while maintaining a Christian worldview.
