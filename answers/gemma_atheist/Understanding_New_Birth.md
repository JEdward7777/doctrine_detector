## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**According to the Bible, "born again" refers to a spiritual transformation that occurs through faith in Jesus Christ.** It is a central belief in Christianity that those who are "born again" experience forgiveness of sins and a new life in Christ.

**Biblical passages that discuss being "born again":**

* "Whoever is born of the Spirit is born anew." - John 3:5
* "I tell you, unless you are born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God." - John 3:3
* "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come." - 2 Corinthians 5:17

**Cultural Considerations:**

* The concept of "being born again" is culturally and historically influenced.
* Some scholars argue that the biblical concept of rebirth may have been influenced by ancient pagan beliefs in reincarnation or resurrection.
* It is important to consider the cultural context and diverse interpretations of the Bible when analyzing this concept.

**Potential Interpretations:**

* **Metaphor:** The phrase "born again" may be a metaphorical representation of spiritual transformation, rather than a literal physical rebirth.
* **Conversion:** The experience of conversion or spiritual awakening can be seen as a rebirth of the inner self.
* **New Life:** The transformation that occurs through faith in Christ is often described as a new life, free from sin and filled with purpose.

**My Perspective as an Atheist Scholar:**

* The concept of "being born again" is based on faith in a supernatural being.
* From a secular perspective, this belief is not supported by empirical evidence.
* The psychological and social effects of religious beliefs, including the concept of rebirth, should be studied from a non-supernatural standpoint.
