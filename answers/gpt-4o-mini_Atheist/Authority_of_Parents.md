## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The biblical basis for parental authority over children is found in several scriptures that emphasize the roles and responsibilities of parents and the expected behavior of children. Here are key passages that articulate this relationship:

1. **Ephesians 6:1-4** - "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—which is the first commandment with a promise—'so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.' Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord." This passage highlights both the obligation of children to obey their parents and the responsibility of parents to guide and nurture their children.

2. **Proverbs 22:6** - "Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it." This verse underscores the importance of parental guidance and discipline in shaping a child's future.

3. **Colossians 3:20-21** - "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged." Similar to the passage in Ephesians, this emphasizes obedience and parental care.

4. **Deuteronomy 6:6-7** - "These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up." This passage illustrates the responsibility of parents to teach their children about faith and morals.

5. **Exodus 20:12** - "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you." This commandment places a strong emphasis on honoring parental authority, linking it to well-being and longevity.

Overall, these passages convey that parental authority is not only recognized but also established as a fundamental aspect of family structure in biblical texts. Parents are tasked with the duty of nurturing and guiding their children in a manner that reflects religious values and societal norms. This authority is balanced by the responsibility to care for and not to provoke children, promoting a healthy and respectful familial relationship.
