## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Pharisees, a prominent Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, held beliefs that significantly influenced later Jewish and Christian thought. Regarding life after death, the Pharisees believed in a form of resurrection. They held that the righteous would be resurrected to eternal life, while the wicked might face punishment. This belief in resurrection distinguishes them from some other Jewish groups of the time, such as the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection and the existence of an afterlife.

In terms of spiritual beings, the Pharisees acknowledged the existence of angels and demons, viewing them as part of the spiritual realm that interacted with the physical world. They believed that these beings played a role in the workings of divine providence and the moral order of the universe.

Overall, the Pharisaic worldview was characterized by a strong belief in an afterlife and a system of moral judgment based on one's actions in this life. Their teachings laid important groundwork for later theological developments in Judaism and Christianity.
