## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Certainly! The term "woe" appears frequently in the Bible, often signaling a lament, warning, or proclamation of judgment. Here are a few notable examples, along with their implications regarding God's judgment:

1. **Matthew 23:13-16** - In this passage, Jesus pronounces woes upon the Pharisees and scribes for their hypocrisy and for obstructing others from entering the Kingdom of Heaven. He calls them "blind guides" and points to their failure to lead the people righteously. This indicates that God's judgment is directed at spiritual leaders who mislead others.

2. **Isaiah 5:8-23** - The prophet Isaiah uses the term "woe" multiple times in this chapter to pronounce judgment against various social injustices, such as greed, corruption, and the perversion of justice. Each woe serves as a warning against oppressive behaviors, reinforcing the idea that God's judgment is concerned with ethical conduct and social justice.

3. **Luke 6:24-26** - Here, Jesus contrasts blessings with woes. He pronounces a woe on the rich, those who are well-fed and laughing, implying that their current state may lead to future judgment. This highlights a theme of reversal in God's judgment, suggesting that earthly success does not equate to divine favor.

4. **Revelation 18:10-19** - In this passage about the fall of Babylon, the term "woe" is used to express sorrow over the destruction of a great city that symbolizes moral decay. The use of "woe" emphasizes the finality of Godâ€™s judgment against sin and the consequences of turning away from His ways.

These examples collectively reveal that the term "woe" serves as a harbinger of divine displeasure and impending judgment. It underscores the seriousness of both personal and communal sins, serving as a call to repentance and a reminder of the moral order that God upholds. The usage of "woe" emphasizes the care with which God observes human behavior and the seriousness of moral accountability.
