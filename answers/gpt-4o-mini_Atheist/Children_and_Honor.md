## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible addresses the concept of children honoring their parents primarily in the book of Exodus and in the New Testament. One of the most direct references is found in the Ten Commandments, specifically in Exodus 20:12, which states, "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you." This directive emphasizes respect, obedience, and care for one's parents.

In the New Testament, Ephesians 6:1-3 reiterates this command, saying, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—this is the first commandment with a promise—that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth." 

These verses suggest that honoring parents involves respect, obedience, and a commitment to family well-being. It's also important to see this contextually, as the cultural expectations around familial roles and respect might influence interpretations and practices regarding this command across different communities and times.
