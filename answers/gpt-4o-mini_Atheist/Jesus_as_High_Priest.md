## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In Christian theology, Jesus is often referred to as the "High Priest," particularly in the context of the book of Hebrews in the New Testament. This concept is rooted in the understanding of a priest as a mediator between God and humanity. Jesus is seen as fulfilling and transcending the role of the Levitical priests of the Old Testament.

1. **High Priest According to Order of Melchizedek**: Hebrews describes Jesus as a High Priest not in the traditional lineage of the Levites, but in the order of Melchizedek, a figure from Genesis who was both a king and a priest. This emphasizes Jesusâ€™ unique and eternal priesthood, which differs from the temporary nature of the Levitical priesthood.

2. **Sacrifice of Jesus**: Unlike human priests who offered sacrifices of animals to atone for the sins of the people, Jesus is believed to have offered himself as the ultimate sacrificial lamb. This act is seen as once and for all, bringing a new covenant and thereby rendering the old sacrificial system obsolete.

3. **Implications for Human Priests**: If Jesus is viewed as the fulfillment of the sacrificial system, it implies that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer necessary for atonement of sins. Instead, human priests (in traditions that retain a priestly structure) may focus on guiding the community, administering sacraments, or performing rituals, but not in a sacrificial context in the same way as in the past.

4. **Mediation**: Jesus as the High Priest serves as the ultimate mediator, making direct access to God available to believers. This shifts the understanding of priesthood from a ceremonial practice requiring sacrifices to a more relational and spiritual framework, where individuals can approach God through faith in Christ.

In summary, Jesus' reference as the High Priest signifies a transformation in the understanding of sacrifice and mediation in relation to the priesthood, emphasizing his unique role as the one-time sacrifice for humanity's sins and establishing a direct relationship between individuals and the divine.
