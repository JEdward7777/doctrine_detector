## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Early Christians expressed their fellowship in a variety of ways, rooted in the communal and spiritual practices of their time. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Shared Meals**: The practice of the communal meal, often referred to as the Agape feast, was central to early Christian fellowship. These gatherings allowed Christians to share food and strengthen community bonds while also reflecting on the teachings of Jesus.

2. **Worship Practices**: Early Christians gathered regularly for worship, which often included singing hymns, prayer, and readings from the Scriptures. These gatherings fostered a sense of unity and collective identity.

3. **Baptism and the Eucharist**: Sacraments such as baptism and the Eucharist (Communion) were important rites that not only marked an individual’s entry into the faith but also reinforced the identity of the community as the body of Christ.

4. **Mutual Support and Care**: Early Christian communities practiced communal living and shared their resources. This included helping those in need, providing for the less fortunate, and caring for widows and orphans, reflecting the teachings of Jesus about loving one’s neighbor.

5. **Evangelism and Mission Work**: Fellowship was also expressed through a shared mission to spread the teachings of Christ. Early Christians worked together to convert others, establishing new communities along the way.

6. **Letters and Communication**: Early church leaders, such as Paul, wrote letters to various communities addressing theological issues, guidance, and encouragement. These letters were read aloud in gatherings, fostering a sense of connection and shared belief.

7. **Community Leadership**: Leadership structures within the communities, often involving elders or deacons, helped to maintain order and provide spiritual guidance, which strengthened the communal ties among believers.

8. **Persecution and Solidarity**: In times of persecution, the shared experience of suffering and the commitment to support one another reinforced the community's bonds. Christians often helped each other through hardships, demonstrating solidarity.

These expressions of fellowship were foundational in shaping the identity and growth of early Christianity, creating a distinct community centered around shared beliefs and practices.
