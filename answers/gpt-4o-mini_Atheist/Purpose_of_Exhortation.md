## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage, instruct, and uplift believers in their faith. Exhortation serves as a means of spiritual encouragement, urging individuals to live in accordance with the teachings of Jesus and the principles of the Christian faith. This can include encouraging moral conduct, reinforcing the importance of community and fellowship, and prompting believers to persevere in the face of difficulties.

Various passages illustrate this purpose. For example, in Hebrews 10:24-25, believers are encouraged to consider how to spur one another on toward love and good deeds, emphasizing the communal aspect of faith. Similarly, 1 Thessalonians 5:11 reflects the call to encourage one another and build each other up, pointing to the supportive nature of the community in the journey of faith.

Exhortation can also involve admonishment or correction, guiding individuals toward spiritual maturity and helping them to align their lives more closely with the teachings of scripture. Overall, it aims to foster growth, strengthen faith, and enhance the overall health of the Christian community.
