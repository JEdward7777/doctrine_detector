After Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and subsequently died, Matthias was chosen to replace him among the twelve apostles. This selection is described in the Book of Acts, specifically Acts 1:15-26, where the remaining apostles cast lots to determine who would take Judas's place. Matthias was then numbered with the eleven apostles, restoring the group back to twelve.
