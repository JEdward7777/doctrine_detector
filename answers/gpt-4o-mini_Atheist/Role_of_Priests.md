## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, priests held significant responsibilities and played a central role in the religious life of the Israelite community. Their main responsibilities included:

1. **Sacrificial Offerings**: Priests were responsible for offering sacrifices to God on behalf of the people. This included burnt offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings, as outlined in the books of Leviticus and Numbers.

2. **Performing Rituals**: They conducted various religious rituals and ceremonies, including those related to festivals, purification rites, and the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).

3. **Teaching the Law**: Priests were tasked with instructing the Israelites in the laws and commandments of God. They served as spiritual leaders and interpreters of the Torah, guiding the people in their adherence to God's will.

4. **Maintaining the Sanctuary**: Priests were charged with the care and maintenance of the Tabernacle (and later the Temple), ensuring that it remained ritually pure and that the sacred items were properly handled.

5. **Intermediary Role**: They acted as intermediaries between God and the people, representing the community in their prayers and offerings, and conveying God's messages to the people.

6. **Divination and Seeking Guidance**: Priests sometimes engaged in practices such as consulting the Urim and Thummim to discern God's will on various matters, particularly in decisions affecting the nation.

These roles were primarily fulfilled by the descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, who were designated as the Levitical priests. The establishment of these roles and practices is detailed in the Pentateuch, particularly in Leviticus and Exodus.
