In the Bible, the primary role of a prophet is to serve as a mediator between God and people. Prophets are often described as individuals who receive divine revelations, messages, or visions, which they are then tasked with communicating to others. This can include warnings, guidance, and encouragement, often aimed at turning people back to proper worship and ethical living according to God's will.

Prophets also serve to interpret events in light of God's covenant with His people, offering commentary on societal and spiritual conditions. They frequently challenge the status quo and call for repentance and justice, emphasizing moral and spiritual integrity. Their role evolves through various biblical texts, but central themes include the proclamation of God's word, the calling for social justice, and the foretelling of future events or consequences based on the current moral and ethical conduct of the people.

Ultimately, the role of a prophet in the biblical context is multifaceted, encompassing both the duties of a teacher and a challenger, with the aim of guiding people toward a closer relationship with the divine.
