The practice of interceding for others, or praying on behalf of others, is well-documented in the Bible. Here are several verses that reflect this theme:

1. **1 Timothy 2:1-2**: "I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone— for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness." This passage emphasizes the importance of interceding for all people, including those in authority.

2. **James 5:16**: "Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." This verse speaks to the power of communal prayer and intercession, highlighting the impact it can have on healing.

3. **Romans 8:26-27**: "In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God." This highlights the divine aspect of intercession, suggesting that the Holy Spirit intercedes on behalf of believers.

4. **Job 42:10**: "After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before." This demonstrates Job’s intercessory prayer for his friends and the subsequent blessings he received as a result.

5. **Exodus 32:11-14**: In this narrative, Moses intercedes with God on behalf of the Israelites after they sin with the golden calf. His plea is a powerful example of intercessory prayer influencing divine action.

6. **Luke 22:32**: Jesus tells Peter, "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail." This shows Jesus' intercession for his disciples, underscoring the importance of support and prayer for others.

These verses provide a foundation for understanding intercession in the context of prayer, community, and divine support, illustrating its significance in the spiritual life described in the Bible.
