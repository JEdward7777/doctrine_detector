## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The shift in the understanding of Hades in the New Testament can be observed through various passages that depict it not merely as a neutral location for the dead, but rather as a place associated with judgment and the unrighteous. Here are some key verses that illustrate this transition:

1. **Luke 16:19-31 (The Rich Man and Lazarus)**: This parable presents Hades as a place of torment for the rich man after his death, contrasting his fate with that of Lazarus, who is comforted. The rich man's suffering and plea for relief signify a departure from the neutral concept of Hades.

2. **Matthew 11:23**: In this verse, Jesus states that Capernaum will be brought down to Hades. This suggests that Hades is associated with judgment and can be seen as a consequence of unrepentant sin, rather than simply a place of waiting for all souls.

3. **Matthew 16:18**: Here, Jesus mentions, "the gates of Hades will not prevail against it," indicating that Hades has a malevolent aspect but also the idea that the Church will ultimately triumph over it. This implies a broader understanding of Hades as a realm associated with opposition to God's kingdom.

4. **Revelation 20:13-14**: This passage describes the final judgment, where Death and Hades are cast into the lake of fire, indicating that Hades contains the unrighteous and is a temporary holding place until the final judgment.

5. **Acts 2:27**: Quoting Psalm 16:10, Peter speaks of Christ not being abandoned to Hades, which implies a distinction between the righteous and the unrighteous in terms of outcomes related to Hades and resurrection.

These verses collectively contribute to a nuanced understanding of Hades in the New Testament, framing it as a place with a dichotomy between the righteous and unrighteous, rather than simply a neutral waiting area for all souls.
