The Bible offers several passages that highlight the characteristics of fools and foolish behavior. Here are some notable examples:

1. **Proverbs 10:23** – "Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool, but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding." This verse suggests that fools do not take wrongdoing seriously, indicating a lack of moral discernment.

2. **Proverbs 12:15** – "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice." This highlights the folly of being overly self-assured and dismissing the wisdom of others.

3. **Proverbs 18:2** – "A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion." This implies that fools prioritize their own viewpoints over seeking knowledge and comprehension.

4. **Ecclesiastes 10:12-13** – "The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him. The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is evil madness." This passage illustrates how foolishness can lead to self-destruction.

5. **Proverbs 26:11** – "Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly." This metaphor illustrates the stubbornness and lack of growth often seen in foolish behavior.

6. **Psalm 14:1** – "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'" This verse addresses the foolishness of denying the divine, framing it as a fundamental flaw in understanding and perspective.

7. **Proverbs 1:7** – "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction." This links foolishness with a rejection of wisdom and guidance.

These passages collectively emphasize that foolish behavior is often characterized by a lack of humility, an aversion to wisdom, a disregard for moral standards, and a tendency to repeat harmful patterns.
