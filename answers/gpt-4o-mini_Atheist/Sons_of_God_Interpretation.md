## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The term "sons of God," particularly in the context of Genesis 6:1-4, has been interpreted in several ways throughout biblical scholarship and among various religious traditions. Here are some of the prominent interpretations:

1. **Fallen Angels Interpretation**: One traditional view is that "sons of God" refers to fallen angels or celestial beings who took human wives, leading to the birth of the Nephilim. This interpretation is often based on the Book of Enoch and other apocryphal texts that elaborate on the idea of angelic beings interacting with humans.

2. **Lineage of Seth**: Another interpretation is that the "sons of God" are the descendants of Seth, Adamâ€™s righteous son, while the "daughters of men" are the descendants of Cain, representing a more sinful lineage. This view emphasizes the theme of righteousness and wickedness intermingling, which leads to moral decline.

3. **Royalty or Nobility**: Some scholars argue that "sons of God" refers to ancient kings or nobility, as the phrase can denote someone in a position of authority or honor. In this interpretation, the narrative is understood to reflect the corruption and moral decay of leaders who take multiple wives.

4. **Human Beings in General**: A more general interpretation suggests that "sons of God" could denote all humans or believers. This view emphasizes the creator's relationship with humanity as a whole rather than focusing on specific lineages or beings.

5. **Ancient Near Eastern Context**: Some scholars consider the phrase within the broader context of Ancient Near Eastern literature, where similar terms are used to describe figures of divine or semi-divine status. Under this perspective, the term might reflect cultural views on divinity and kingship that were prevalent at the time.

6. **Theological Metaphor**: Lastly, some interpretations approach the term metaphorically, representing spiritual truths about humanity's relationship with God. In this view, "sons of God" reflects themes of covenant, creation, and belonging rather than a strictly literal lineage.

Each of these interpretations reveals different aspects of ancient beliefs and theological concepts and reflects a range of understandings that have developed over centuries of biblical interpretation.
