## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The title “Lamb of God” in relation to Jesus has profound roots in the sacrificial system outlined in the Old Testament. In ancient Israel, animals, particularly lambs, were used as offerings to atone for sins and seek favor from God. The lambs were often seen as symbols of innocence and purity, making them suitable for sacrificial purposes.

1. **Passover Lamb**: The most significant reference is the Passover lamb, which was sacrificed during the Exodus from Egypt. In Exodus 12, each family was instructed to select a blemish-free lamb, slaughter it, and spread its blood on their doorposts to protect their households from the plague that struck Egypt. This act of substitution—where the lamb dies so the firstborn sons of the Israelites are spared—serves as a foreshadowing of Jesus’ sacrificial death.

2. **Atonement and Sacrificial System**: In the broader sacrificial system, a lamb could also be used for sin offerings and other types of sacrifices intended to cleanse or restore the relationships between people and God. The role of the lamb in these sacrifices emphasizes the theme of sacrifice as a means to atone for sin and reconcile humanity with the divine.

3. **New Testament Interpretations**: The Gospel writers and early Christians drew connections between Jesus and these sacrificial lambs, notably in the writings of John the Baptist, who identifies Jesus as the “Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). This reflects the belief that Jesus' death serves as a final and ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins, fulfilling and superseding the need for ongoing animal sacrifices in the Old Testament.

4. **Theological Implications**: The title encompasses a theological depth that resonates with themes of redemption, innocence, and sacrifice. It reflects the belief that through Jesus' sacrifice, believers can achieve forgiveness and reconciliation with God, echoing the sentiments of the earlier sacrificial practices.

In essence, Jesus being referred to as the “Lamb of God” powerfully connects him to the sacrificial lambs of the Old Testament, encapsulating the core themes of sacrifice, redemption, and divine love that are foundational to Christian theology.
