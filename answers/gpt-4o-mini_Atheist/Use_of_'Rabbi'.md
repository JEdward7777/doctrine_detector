## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The title 'Rabbi' is traditionally associated with Jewish teachers and scholars. In the New Testament, John the Baptist is not specifically referred to as 'Rabbi,' but he is recognized as a prophetic figure and a teacher, along with having a significant following. He baptized Jesus, and his role was pivotal in preparing the way for Jesus' ministry.

Jesus, on the other hand, is often referred to as 'Rabbi' by his disciples and followers, as he took on the role of a teacher and interpreter of Jewish law. The term 'Rabbi' reflects his position as a respected figure in Jewish tradition, one who provided teachings and guidance within the context of first-century Judaism.

It’s important to note that the use of titles and their implications can differ significantly across cultural and historical contexts. In examining these figures, it’s essential to appreciate the nuances in their roles as teachers in the context of their time.
