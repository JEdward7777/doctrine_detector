Acts 9:13-16 deals with the calling of Saul (who later becomes Paul), highlighting how God chose him to be a vessel for sharing the Gospel to Gentiles. In this passage, Ananias is hesitant to accept Saul because of his past persecution of Christians. However, God reassures Ananias that Saul is His chosen instrument to proclaim the name of Jesus before the Gentiles, kings, and the people of Israel. This indicates an early understanding that the message of Christ will extend beyond the Jewish community to include Gentiles.

Galatians 2:16 emphasizes the theological basis for the inclusion of Gentiles in the faith. It states that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. Paul argues that both Jews and Gentiles are justified by faith, highlighting that the law, which was primarily given to the Jews, does not restrict access to salvation. This underscores the universal nature of the Gospel and affirms that faith in Christ is the means of salvation for all, regardless of their ethnic or cultural background.

In summary, both passages affirm the inclusive nature of the Christian faith, establishing that the Gospel is for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that salvation comes through faith in Christ rather than adherence to the law. This reflects the foundational Christian belief in the universality of the Gospel message.
