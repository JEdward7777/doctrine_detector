## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
A miracle, in a Christian context, is typically understood as an event that occurs outside the natural laws of the universe, demonstrating God's power and authority. Miracles are often seen as acts of divine intervention that reveal God’s presence, compassion, and sovereignty. 

In the Bible, miracles performed by Jesus, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, and controlling nature, serve multiple purposes: they provide evidence of Christ's divine nature, affirm His message, and showcase God's kingdom breaking into the world. For instance, in the Gospel of John, Jesus performs several signs (miracles) that are meant to lead the observers to believe in Him (John 20:30-31).

The relationship between miracles and God's authority is significant. Miracles affirm God’s supreme power over creation, illness, and even death itself. They illustrate the belief that God is not only the creator of the universe but also actively involved in it. The authority of God is exemplified in His ability to intervene in human affairs in ways that transcend ordinary experiences.

In a theological context, miracles invite believers to trust in God’s providence and sovereignty, reinforcing the idea that nothing is impossible for Him (Matthew 19:26). They serve to deepen faith, encourage worship, and call individuals to respond to God’s call. Furthermore, miracles often challenge the natural order, prompting believers to recognize the limitations of human understanding and control, leading to a greater reliance on God's authority and power.
