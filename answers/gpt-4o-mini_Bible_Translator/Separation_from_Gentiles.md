The Pharisees, a prominent religious group in Judaism during the Second Temple period, were concerned about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles for several theological and cultural reasons:

1. **Covenantal Identity**: The Jewish people understood themselves as God's chosen people, set apart by covenant. This identity was deeply rooted in their scriptures and traditions, emphasizing that they were to live according to God's laws and commands, which included being distinct from surrounding nations.

2. **Holiness and Purity Laws**: The Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) contains numerous laws regarding ritual purity, dietary restrictions, and moral conduct. The Pharisees emphasized these laws as essential for maintaining the holiness of the community. Associating with Gentiles could risk ritual impurity and compromise the community’s fidelity to these laws.

3. **Preservation of Faith and Practices**: The intermingling with Gentiles could lead to the assimilation of foreign beliefs and practices, potentially diluting Jewish faith and traditions. The Pharisees aimed to preserve Jewish law and customs, which they viewed as vital for the community’s survival and identity.

4. **Messianic Expectations**: During the time of Jesus, many Jews had messianic expectations. The Pharisees believed that adherence to the law and the maintenance of Jewish identity were crucial for the arrival of the Messiah. Mixing with Gentiles might have been seen as undermining these hopes.

5. **Social and Political Context**: In a time of Roman occupation and diaspora, there was a heightened sense of vulnerability within the Jewish community. Separation from Gentiles was also a way to reinforce a solid, unified Jewish identity in the face of external pressures.

In summary, the Pharisees' concerns about separation were rooted in their desire to maintain Jewish religious identity, obedience to the law, and the community’s spiritual integrity in a complex and often hostile environment.
