In the Bible, "tempting God" refers to testing or challenging God’s authority, faithfulness, or provision, typically in ways that demonstrate a lack of faith or reverence. The concept is often illustrated through specific examples in Scripture, and it's important to understand both the intent behind the behavior and the theological implications.

One of the key passages that addresses this idea is found in **Deuteronomy 6:16**, where the Israelites are warned not to "tempt the Lord your God as you tempted Him in Massah." This refers to the incident in Exodus 17, where the Israelites tested God's patience by doubting His provision of water. They demanded to know if God was truly among them, which implied a lack of faith in His presence and care.

Another significant reference is found in **Matthew 4:7**, where Jesus responds to the devil's temptation to throw Himself from the pinnacle of the temple, saying, “You shall not tempt the Lord your God.” Here, Jesus emphasizes that testing God by putting oneself in danger to see if God will intervene is inappropriate. 

Tempting God can take several forms, including:

1. **Doubting His promises**: When believers question God’s fidelity to His word or His ability to protect and provide.
2. **Presuming on His grace**: Engaging in sinful behavior while expecting God to forgive or shield from consequences without true repentance.
3. **Demanding signs or miracles**: Insisting that God prove Himself through extraordinary acts instead of trusting Him based on His character and previous actions.

The consequences of tempting God can be severe, as seen in various biblical examples. For the Israelites in the wilderness, their lack of faith resulted in a generation that did not enter the Promised Land (Numbers 14:20-23). In the New Testament, Jesus’ admonition to not tempt God underscores the importance of faith that trusts God without needing constant affirmations through testing.

In summary, to 'tempt God' is to place oneself in a position of testing God's character or willingness to act based on doubt or disregard for His commandments. This behavior can lead to significant spiritual consequences, including loss of blessings, judgment, or a hardened heart. Understanding His faithfulness and acting in faith rather than testing Him is an essential part of the biblical teaching on this subject.
