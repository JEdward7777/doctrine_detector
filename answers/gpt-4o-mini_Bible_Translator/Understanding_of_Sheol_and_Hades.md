## Question [Understanding of Sheol and Hades](../../questions/Understanding_of_Sheol_and_Hades.md)
How do the concepts of Sheol and Hades differ in the context of the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous?

## Target answer from notes
In biblical context, Sheol and Hades refer to a place of the dead but were understood differently over time. Initially, both represented a neutral place where all the dead awaited judgment. However, in the New Testament, Hades becomes associated primarily with the unrighteous, contrasting with 'Abraham's side' or 'paradise' for the righteous.

The concepts of Sheol and Hades in the Bible have distinct meanings, especially in relation to the afterlife, though they are sometimes used interchangeably in modern translations. 

**Sheol** is a term found in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and refers to the abode of the dead. It is described as a shadowy place where both the righteous and the unrighteous go after death. In Sheol, there is no distinction between these groups, as it represents a state of existence often characterized by silence and separation from God. For instance, in Psalm 6:5, it says, “For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol, who will give you praise?” Sheol can be seen as a temporary holding place rather than a final destination.

**Hades**, on the other hand, is derived from Greek mythology and appears in the New Testament. Hades is the Greek equivalent to Sheol, but it is often associated more with the concepts of judgment and separation. In the New Testament, particularly in Luke 16:19-31, Jesus tells the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, where Hades is depicted as a place of torment for the unrighteous. The rich man in Hades exhibits suffering and thirst, while Lazarus, representing the righteous, is comforted in "Abraham's bosom." This parable illustrates a greater distinction between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous in the afterlife.

In summary, while Sheol encompasses a broader concept of the afterlife in the Hebrew Scriptures primarily as a place for the dead without specific distinctions, Hades in the New Testament is presented with a clearer division—often associated with judgment and the experiences of the righteous and unrighteous after death. Ultimately, both terms signify a state of being that precedes the final resurrection and the judgment that will determine eternal outcomes. The distinction becomes even clearer when considering eschatological teachings about the final destinations of heaven and hell, which follow from these intermediate states.
