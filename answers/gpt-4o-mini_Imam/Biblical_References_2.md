In the Christian tradition, several Bible verses illustrate the concept of God's majesty. Here are a few key examples:

1. **Psalm 145:3** - "Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; his greatness is unsearchable." This verse highlights the infinite greatness and majesty of God.

2. **Isaiah 6:1-3** - "In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim... 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!'" This passage vividly describes the majestic presence of God in a heavenly vision.

3. **1 Chronicles 29:11-12** - "Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all." This verse expresses God's sovereignty and supreme majesty over all creation.

4. **Job 37:22** - "Out of the north comes golden splendor; God is clothed with awesome majesty." This verse emphasizes the awe-inspiring nature of God's majesty.

5. **Psalm 93:1** - "The Lord reigns; he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved." Here, the majesty of God is linked to His sovereign reign over the world.

These verses reflect the grandeur and exalted nature of God in Christian theology, which can offer insights into the reverence and awe that is often associated with the concept of majesty in the Abrahamic faiths, including Islam.
