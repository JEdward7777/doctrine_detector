The ephod worn by the high priest, as described in the Book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible, was made from specific materials that were both luxurious and symbolic. According to Exodus 28:5-6, the ephod was crafted from:

1. **Gold**: This symbolizes purity and divinity.
2. **Blue**: This color is often associated with the heavens and the divine.
3. **Purple**: This color represents royalty and majesty.
