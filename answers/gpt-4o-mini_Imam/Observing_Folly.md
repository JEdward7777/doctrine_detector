In the context of the Bible, the concept of folly or foolishness is often discussed, particularly in the books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and throughout the wisdom literature. Some actions categorized as folly include:

1. **Rejecting Wisdom**: The Bible often portrays the refusal to seek or listen to wisdom as foolishness. For instance, Proverbs 1:7 states, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction."

2. **Lack of Self-Control**: Engaging in impulsive behavior without considering the consequences can be described as folly. Proverbs 14:29 says, "Whoever is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly."

3. **Dishonesty**: Proverbs 12:15 states, "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice." Acting contrary to integrity and honesty is categorized as foolish.

4. **Pride and Arrogance**: Proverbs 16:18 declares, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." This illustrates how pride can lead to foolish decisions.

5. **Ignoring God’s Commandments**: Ecclesiastes 12:13 advises to fear God and keep His commandments, mentioning that ignoring divine guidance is a form of folly.

6. **Being Unteachable**: Fools often refuse correction or learning, as depicted in Proverbs 9:8, "Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you."

7. **Speaking Carelessly**: Proverbs 18:2 states, "A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion." This highlights the folly in speaking without seeking understanding.

These examples reflect a broader biblical theme that associates wisdom with humility, obedience to God, and the pursuit of understanding, while folly is often linked to pride, impulsiveness, and a disregard for divine guidance.
