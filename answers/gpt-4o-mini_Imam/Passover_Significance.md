## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
Passover, which is primarily a Jewish holiday, commemorates the Exodus of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. For Christians, Passover holds significant importance in relation to Jesus, particularly regarding His crucifixion and resurrection.

The connection lies mainly in the Last Supper, which is believed to have taken place during Passover. During this meal, Jesus instituted the Eucharist (also known as Communion), where He broke bread and shared wine with His disciples, symbolizing His body and blood. This act established a New Covenant, which Christians believe relates to Jesus being the sacrificial Lamb. Just as the lambs were sacrificed during Passover, Christians view Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for the atonement of sins.

Additionally, the timing of Jesus’ crucifixion during Passover highlights the significance of His sacrificial role. In Christian theology, Jesus’ sacrifice is likened to the Passover lamb, whose blood was a sign for the Israelites to be spared from the angel of death.

Thus, for Christians, Passover is a foreshadowing of Jesus’ redemptive work and is deeply intertwined with the themes of salvation and liberation in both the Old and New Testaments.
