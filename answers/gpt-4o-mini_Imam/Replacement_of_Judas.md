## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and subsequently died, the remaining eleven apostles sought to replace him to restore their number to twelve. According to the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 1:15-26), Matthias was chosen by casting lots. The apostles prayed for guidance, and ultimately, Matthias was selected to take Judas's place among the twelve apostles.

## Grade
80.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a correct understanding of Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot. However, the concern about recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension is not fully addressed in the response. More emphasis on how Matthias' appointment ensured the continuity of apostolic leadership would have enhanced the answer.
