## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, the process of sanctification for believers in Jesus is described as a journey of growth in holiness and spiritual maturity. While the New Testament is primarily a Christian text, it emphasizes key concepts that resonate with themes in Islam regarding personal development and connection with God.

1. **Initial Sanctification**: Believers are viewed as sanctified upon their faith in Jesus Christ. This is presented in passages like 1 Corinthians 6:11, where it states that believers are washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus.

2. **Progressive Sanctification**: The New Testament portrays sanctification as an ongoing process. Believers are encouraged to continue growing in their faith, reflecting the character of Christ and living according to God's commandments. Romans 12:1-2 speaks of presenting one’s body as a living sacrifice and being transformed through the renewal of the mind.

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit**: The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in the sanctification process. Believers are guided, empowered, and convicted by the Spirit to lead lives aligned with God's will. Galatians 5:22-23 describes the fruits of the Spirit, which are characteristic of a sanctified life.

4. **Community and Accountability**: The New Testament suggests that the community of believers (the Church) is significant in the process of sanctification. In Hebrews 10:24-25, believers are encouraged to meet together and encourage one another, fostering mutual growth in faith.

5. **Looking toward Perfection**: Sanctification is also described as a goal, where believers strive towards the perfection exemplified by Jesus. Philippians 3:12-14 discusses pressing on toward the goal of the heavenly prize, reflecting a continuous effort towards spiritual maturity.

While the specifics of the process differ in Christianity and Islam, the underlying principle of striving for a closer relationship with God and improving oneself morally and spiritually resonates across both faiths.
