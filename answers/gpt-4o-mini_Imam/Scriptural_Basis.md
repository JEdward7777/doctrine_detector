## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Christian theology, the concept of propitiation refers to the act of appeasing or satisfying the wrath of God, particularly in the context of atonement for sin. This concept is primarily grounded in the New Testament. Here are a few verses that are often cited in relation to propitiation:

1. **Romans 3:25**: "Whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed."

2. **1 John 2:2**: "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world."

3. **1 John 4:10**: "In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins."

These verses highlight the belief that Jesus Christ's sacrifice serves to reconcile humanity with God, emphasizing the importance of His atonement in Christian understanding.

As a Muslim, it's important to note that while we respect the scriptures of other faiths, our beliefs regarding sin, atonement, and the nature of God are different. In Islam, we believe in seeking forgiveness directly from Allah, and that He is merciful and forgiving without the need for a mediator or propitiation through sacrifice.
