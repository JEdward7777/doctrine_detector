The term "El Shaddai" is a Hebrew phrase that is often translated as "God Almighty" in many English Bible translations. This term, which appears in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament, conveys the idea of God's omnipotence and sufficiency.

When translating "El Shaddai" into other languages, the rendering may vary slightly based on cultural and linguistic contexts, but the essence of the term generally remains consistent. Here are a few translations in different languages based on common Bible translations:

1. **Spanish**: "El Shaddai" is often translated as "Dios Todopoderoso."
2. **French**: In French translations, it is typically rendered as "Dieu Tout-Puissant."
3. **German**: The phrase is often translated as "Gott der Allmächtige."
4. **Italian**: In Italian, it is commonly translated as "Dio Onnipotente."
5. **Arabic**: In Arabic translations of the Bible, it is rendered as "الله القدير" (Allah Al-Qadeer), meaning "God the All-Powerful."
6. **Portuguese**: In Portuguese, it is often translated as "Deus Todo-Poderoso."

These translations emphasize God's power and sovereignty, similar to the original Hebrew meaning. If you have a specific language in mind or wish to know more about a particular translation, please feel free to ask!

Comment: The response provides a good overview of how "El Shaddai" is translated into different languages and the general idea of conveying God's omnipotence and sufficiency. However, the concern about ensuring accuracy in representing God's name across cultures and languages could have been addressed more directly. It would have been beneficial to emphasize the importance of maintaining the significance and reverence of God's name in translations, even if the phonetics may vary. Overall, while informative, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of accurately translating divine names in different languages.
