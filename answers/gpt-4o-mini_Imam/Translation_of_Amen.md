## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the phrases used by Jesus, such as "truly I tell you" (often translated from the Greek phrase "ἀμήν ἤμιν λέγω ὑμῖν" or "Amen, amen, I say to you"), the word "truly" can carry several meanings and translations, especially when considered in different languages and contexts. Here are a few potential translations and equivalents in various languages:

1. **Arabic**: The phrase can be translated to "أقول لكم الحق" (aqulu lakum al-haqq), which means "I say to you the truth." The word "حق" (haqq) means truth.

2. **Urdu**: In Urdu, it might be translated as "بیشک" (beshak), meaning "certainly" or "indeed," which conveys a strong affirmation of the statement about to follow.

3. **Farsi (Persian)**: The word "حقیقتاً" (haqtan) or "بی تردید" (bi tardid), which means "truthfully" or "without doubt," could be used in a similar context.

4. **Turkish**: The phrase can be translated as "doğrusu" or "gerçekten," which also convey a sense of certainty or affirmation.

5. **Other Biblical Translations**: In different versions of the Bible, the word "truly" may also appear as "verily," "certainly," or "amen," emphasizing the importance of the statement being made.

In all these translations, the essence remains the same: to signify that what follows is a profound truth or important teaching. The use of "truly" serves to affirm the sincerity and significance of the words spoken by Jesus.
