## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In understanding the nature of God's wrath as described in the Bible, it is essential to note that it is fundamentally different from human anger in several ways.

1. **Righteousness**: God's wrath is portrayed as a righteous response to sin and injustice. It is a reflection of His holy nature and divine justice. According to scripture, God's anger is not capricious or irrational, but is always founded in His perfect morality. For instance, in Romans 1:18, it says, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men..."

2. **Purpose**: The purpose of God's wrath is redemptive rather than merely punitive. It aims to bring about repentance, justice, and ultimately restoration. God desires for people to turn away from sin and return to Him, which is evident in passages like 2 Peter 3:9, where it says that God is patient and does not wish for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.

3. **Control and Restraint**: Human anger is often characterized by a loss of control, driven by emotions such as frustration, jealousy, or resentment. In contrast, God's anger is always measured, fully under His control, and never driven by such impulses. God does not act out of frustration or malice; rather, He acts to fulfill His divine purposes.

4. **Eternity and Scope**: God's wrath encompasses not just individual actions but the broader cosmic implications of sin and evil. It reflects His intention to judge all sin ultimately (as seen in Revelation), whereas human anger tends to be immediate, local, and often transitory, focusing on specific events or people.

5. **As a Part of Love**: Interestingly, God's wrath is also seen as an expression of His love. Just as a parent may feel anger towards behaviors that endanger their child's wellbeing, God's wrath against sin stems from His love for humanity and His desire for their ultimate good.

In summary, while both God's wrath and human anger can manifest as responses to sin or wrongdoing, the nature, purpose, and expression of God's wrath as taught in the Bible highlight divine justice, control, and a longing for reconciliation that significantly distinguishes it from human emotions.
