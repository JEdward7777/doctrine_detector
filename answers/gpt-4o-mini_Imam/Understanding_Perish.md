## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of 'perishing' often refers to spiritual death or separation from God rather than mere physical death. In this context, it signifies a loss of eternal life and communion with God, which is viewed as the ultimate consequence of sin and rejecting God's guidance.

For instance, John 3:16 speaks about God's love for humanity and His desire for everyone to attain eternal life rather than perish: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Here, 'perish' emphasizes the fate of those who do not believe or accept God's mercy and salvation.

Additionally, in Matthew 10:28, Jesus advises not to fear those who can kill the body but not the soul, indicating a distinction between physical existence and the eternal state of one's soul. The perishing of the soul implies a separation from God, which is a state of suffering and despair.

In summary, from a New Testament perspective, to 'perish' spiritually means to face eternal separation from God, losing the opportunity for salvation and life that comes from faith in Jesus Christ.
