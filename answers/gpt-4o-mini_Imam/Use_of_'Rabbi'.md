## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, John the Baptist (known as Yahya in Arabic) and Jesus (known as Isa) are both highly respected prophets. However, their titles and roles differ from the interpretation found in Judaism and Christianity.

In the New Testament, Jesus was often referred to as "Rabbi," which means "teacher" or "master" in Hebrew. This title signified his role as a teacher of the Torah and spiritual leader among the people. John the Baptist, on the other hand, is not commonly referred to with the title "Rabbi" in the same manner, but he is recognized for his role in preparing the way for Jesus and preaching repentance.

In Islam, both prophets are acknowledged for their piety and guidance, but the concept of "Rabbi" as understood in Judaism does not carry the same significance. Instead, they are considered as messengers who conveyed God's message to the people. In Islamic thought, the focus is on their prophethood and the messages they delivered, rather than specific titles they might have held in their respective cultures.

Comment: The response provides a good explanation of how Jesus and John the Baptist were regarded as teachers in the Islamic tradition and further elaborates on their roles compared to Judaism and Christianity. It addresses the concern by recognizing the respect and authority associated with their teachings. However, to improve the grade, a deeper analysis of the unique authority and significance of Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity would have been beneficial from a Christian worldview perspective.
