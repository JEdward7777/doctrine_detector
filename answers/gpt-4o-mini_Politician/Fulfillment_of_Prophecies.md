In Biblical teaching, the fulfillment of a prophecy generally means that a specific message or prediction made by a prophet—often inspired by divine revelation—has come to pass or has been realized in some way. This can involve events, personages, or circumstances that were foretold in the scriptures. 

Fulfilled prophecies are often seen as a demonstration of divine sovereignty and truth, affirming the belief that a higher power is actively involved in human history. Different religious traditions interpret fulfillment in various ways; some may see it as a literal event, while others might understand it more symbolically or contextually.

For example, many Christians point to certain prophecies in the Old Testament that they believe were fulfilled in the New Testament, particularly regarding the life and mission of Jesus. Meanwhile, other groups may have varying interpretations of what constitutes fulfillment. 

Overall, discussions about prophecy and its fulfillment can be nuanced and deeply personal, reflecting one's beliefs and traditions. It’s important to approach such topics with sensitivity and an appreciation for diverse perspectives.
