## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Nazirite vow, as outlined in Numbers 6:1-4 in the Hebrew Bible, involves several key restrictions that individuals take upon themselves during the period of their vow. These restrictions include:

1. **Abstaining from Wine and Grapes**: Nazirites are prohibited from consuming wine, other fermented drinks, or any products derived from grapes. This includes fresh grapes and raisins.

2. **Avoiding Haircuts**: Individuals who take the Nazirite vow must not cut their hair for the duration of their vow. Their hair is allowed to grow freely.

3. **Avoiding Contact with the Dead**: Nazirites must avoid any contact with a dead body, including those of close relatives, as this would render them ritually impure.

These restrictions highlight a commitment to holiness and dedication to God during the period of the vow. The vow could be for a specified time or could be indefinite, depending on the individual's commitment. At the conclusion of the vow, certain rituals are performed to signify the completion of this period of dedication.
