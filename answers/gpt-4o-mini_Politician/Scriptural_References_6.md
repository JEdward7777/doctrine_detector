## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Bible offers several passages that illuminate the characteristics of fools and foolish behavior. Here are some notable examples that illustrate this theme:

1. **Proverbs 12:15**: "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice." This passage emphasizes how foolish individuals often reject external input, believing they are always correct.

2. **Proverbs 13:16**: "Every prudent man acts with knowledge, but a fool flaunts his folly." This highlights the idea that a fool may show off their foolishness without understanding the consequences.

3. **Proverbs 18:2**: "A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion." This suggests that foolishness can stem from a lack of openness to learning and a preference for voicing one’s own views.

4. **Ecclesiastes 10:2-3**: "A wise man’s heart inclines him to the right, but a fool’s heart to the left. Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool." These verses illustrate the foolishness of someone who lacks insight and openly displays their lack of wisdom.

5. **Proverbs 26:11**: "Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly." This vividly portrays the idea that a fool often returns to their mistakes without learning or growing from them.

6. **Proverbs 14:7**: "Leave the presence of a fool, for there you do not meet words of knowledge." This advises individuals to distance themselves from those who display foolish behavior as they may hinder wisdom.

These passages serve as a guide for understanding the contrasting traits between wisdom and folly, encouraging people to seek knowledge, understanding, and sound judgment.
