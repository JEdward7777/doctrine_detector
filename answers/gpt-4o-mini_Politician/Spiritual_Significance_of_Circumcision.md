In a Christian context, the phrase "circumcision of the heart" symbolizes a spiritual transformation and the idea of inner renewal. This concept is derived from biblical texts, particularly in the New Testament, where it is contrasted with physical circumcision. It indicates that what matters most is not outward appearances or rituals, but the state of one's heart and relationship with God.

The phrase emphasizes the importance of spiritual purity, love, and a commitment to following God's will. It invites believers to reflect on their attitudes, intentions, and the sincerity of their faith, suggesting that true devotion comes from an inner change rather than merely adhering to external practices. This metaphor encourages personal growth, humility, and a deeper connection to the values of compassion and grace within Christianity.
