## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In Christian teachings, the term "worldly" often refers to attitudes, behaviors, and values that are more aligned with secular or material pursuits rather than spiritual or divine principles. It can imply a focus on worldly pleasures, possessions, and societal norms that may distract individuals from their spiritual commitments and responsibilities. 

Many Christian teachings encourage followers to seek values such as love, compassion, humility, and service to others, which can sometimes stand in contrast to more materialistic or self-centered views. Being "worldly" may be seen as prioritizing temporary or superficial aspects of life over deeper, eternal values.

It's important to approach discussions around this topic with sensitivity, recognizing that individuals may have diverse interpretations of these values and that not everyone will subscribe to the same beliefs. The aim should be to foster understanding and respect for different perspectives while exploring the concepts of spiritual versus worldly priorities.
