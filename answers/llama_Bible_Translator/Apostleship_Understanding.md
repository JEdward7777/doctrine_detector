## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the gospel cannot be overstated. In fact, it's a pivotal moment in redemptive history that has far-reaching implications for the spread of Christianity.

In Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:15-18, and Luke 24:44-49, we see Jesus' explicit instruction to His apostles (and by extension, their successors) to "make disciples" and "teach them to obey everything I have commanded you." This commissioning is significant for several reasons:

1. **Authority**: By sending the apostles, Jesus delegating His authority to spread His message and establish His church. The apostles are not just mere messengers; they are authorized representatives of Christ, carrying His divine commission.
2. **Empowerment**: In John 20:22-23, Jesus breathed on His disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit." This event signified their empowerment to proclaim His message. With the Holy Spirit's guidance, the apostles were enabled to communicate the truth of Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
3. **Continuity**: The apostles' sending is a continuation of Jesus' own ministry. They are not starting from scratch; they are building upon the foundation laid by Christ Himself. This ensures that the message remains consistent with the original teachings of Jesus.
4. **Unity**: The apostolic commission emphasizes the unity of the church. Jesus instructs His followers to "go and make disciples" in all nations, implying a single, unified mission. This command establishes the apostles as the primary leaders of the early Christian movement, ensuring that the message is transmitted uniformly throughout the known world.
5. **Accountability**: The apostles' commission serves as a reminder that they are accountable to Jesus Christ for their ministry. They must answer to Him for their actions, teaching, and disciple-making efforts.

In summary, the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the gospel lies in:

* Authority: Delegated authority from Jesus to spread His message
* Empowerment: Enabled by the Holy Spirit to proclaim His truth
* Continuity: Building upon Christ's own ministry and teachings
* Unity: Ensuring a single, unified mission for the church
* Accountability: Recognizing their responsibility to answer to Jesus for their work

As Bible translators, we recognize that the apostles' commission is not just a historical event but also a theological framework for understanding the spread of Christianity. It emphasizes the importance of authentic representation, consistent teaching, and accountable leadership in spreading the gospel message.
