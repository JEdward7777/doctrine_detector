## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The biblical basis for parental authority over children can be found in several passages throughout Scripture. Here are some key texts:

1. Deuteronomy 6:20-24: This passage emphasizes that parents have a divine responsibility to teach and guide their children, saying "And when your son asks you in the future, 'What is the meaning of the altars we see?' then tell him this is what the Lord has been doing from the beginning. He chose me to be the father of his people and to raise them up, just as one of us would do." (Deut 6:20-24, NIV).

In this passage, God establishes parents as the primary authorities in teaching children about His laws and commands.

2. Ephesians 6:4: This passage instructs fathers to bring their children "up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord" (Eph 6:4, NKJV). The phrase "in the discipline and instruction of the Lord" implies that parents should teach and train their children according to God's Word.

3. Proverbs 1:8-9: This passage encourages fathers to teach their children wisdom and guidance by saying, "Listen, my son! Listen, Israel! Do not forget what I command." (Prov 1:8-9, NIV). The emphasis is on the importance of parental instruction for children.

4. Genesis 18:19: When God chooses Abraham as the father of His people, He says, "For I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord" (Gen 18:19, NKJV). This passage highlights the responsibility of parents to train their children in righteousness.

5. Psalm 127:3-4: This psalm says, "Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, The fruit of the womb is His reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of oneâ€™s bosom" (Psalm 127:3-4, NKJV). Children are seen as God's gift to parents, and parents have a responsibility to train them for His purposes.

6. Hebrews 13:17: This passage exhorts believers, including parents, "Obey your leaders and submit to their guidance. For they watch over you as men who must give an account" (Heb 13:17, NIV). While this text primarily addresses the relationship between church leaders and their members, it also underscores the importance of submission to authority figures, which can include parents.

These passages collectively support the idea that God has entrusted parents with a significant amount of authority over their children. As Christian parents, we are called to fulfill our God-given responsibility by teaching, guiding, and disciplining our children according to His Word, ultimately preparing them for a life of obedience to Him.
