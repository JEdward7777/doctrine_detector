## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of ransom is an important aspect of biblical theology, particularly in the Old Testament. Here are some key verses that reference the idea of ransom:

1. Exodus 21:30 - "If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies at their hands, he shall be punished if the slave gets up after a few days and finds that the slave has suffered serious injury. As a result, there will be no punishment for him."

In this verse, the concept of ransom is not explicitly mentioned, but it sets the stage for understanding the idea of paying a price to spare someone's life.

2. Leviticus 25:47-49 - "The Israelites are my servants, and they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am your God."

This passage emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and His people, highlighting their status as His servants. This understanding is crucial for grasping the concept of ransom.

3. Job 33:24 - "He stretches out his hand in darkness; he takes hold of someone else and brings him out from the darkness."

Job's friend Elihu mentions this verse to illustrate God's ability to reach into human suffering and bring people to Himself. This idea is closely related to the concept of ransom.

4. Isaiah 53:10-12 - "He will see his offspring and prolong his days; the righteous one, he will get five years more. He will peacefully rest with him in the sight of His joy. His knowledge was pleasing to Him. When He sees His good pleasure, He will make Him wise."

This passage is often interpreted as a prophetic description of Jesus Christ's redemptive work on the cross. Verse 10 says that God's righteousness requires a sacrifice for sin (i.e., the ransom) to be paid.

5. Mark 10:45 - "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."

In this passage, Jesus is quoting from Isaiah 53:12 and explicitly identifies Himself as the one who will provide the ransom for many. This verse is crucial for understanding Jesus' mission and the nature of redemption.

6. Matthew 20:28 - "Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."

This passage echoes Mark 10:45, emphasizing that Jesus came to provide a ransom for many, rather than being served.

7. 1 Timothy 2:5-6 - "For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and human beings, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all—the lettering it states—and then he has been appearing to some people."

In this passage, Paul uses the concept of ransom to describe Jesus' redemptive work on behalf of humanity. He emphasizes that Jesus is the one mediator between God and humans.

These verses contribute to our understanding of redemption by highlighting several key points:

1. The concept of ransom is closely tied to the idea of sacrifice (Exodus 21:30, Leviticus 25:47-49).
2. Jesus is the one who provides the ultimate ransom for humanity's sins (Mark 10:45, Matthew 20:28, 1 Timothy 2:5-6).
3. Redemption is a demonstration of God's love and desire to have a relationship with His people (Isaiah 53:10-12, Job 33:24).

In Christian theology, the concept of ransom serves as a powerful metaphor for understanding the extent of Jesus' redemptive work on our behalf.
