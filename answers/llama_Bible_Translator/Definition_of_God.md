What a wonderful question!

The Bible provides an extensive description of God's character, nature, and attributes throughout its pages. Here are some key aspects that help us understand who God is:

1. **Omni-attributes**: The Bible describes God as:
	* Omnipotent (all-powerful): Isaiah 9:6; Psalm 135:5
	* Omniscient (all-knowing): Psalm 139:4; Hebrews 4:13
	* Omnipresent (present everywhere): Jeremiah 23:23-24; Psalm 139:7-12
2. **Immutable**: God is unchanging and consistent in His character: Malachi 3:6; James 1:17
3. **Love**: God's love is a central theme throughout the Bible: Deuteronomy 6:5; John 3:16; Ephesians 2:4-5
	* This love includes:
		+ Agape (unconditional, selfless love): John 15:13; Romans 8:37-39
		+ Phileo (brotherly love): John 11:5; John 15:19
4. **Wisdom**: God is all-wise and full of understanding: Job 28:23-24; Psalm 104:24; Proverbs 3:19
5. **Just** (righteous, fair): Psalm 99:4; Isaiah 45:21; Romans 9:14
6. **Merciful**: God shows compassion and forgiveness to those who seek Him: Exodus 34:6-7; Psalm 103:12-14; Luke 15:11-32
7. **Gracious** (loving, kind): Psalm 30:5; Isaiah 49:13; John 1:14-17
8. **Spirit**: God is a Spirit, and He operates through the Holy Spirit: Genesis 1:2; Job 33:4; Acts 17:28
9. **Personality**: While often considered an abstract concept, God's personality is described as:
	* Personal (able to relate to humans): Genesis 3:8-10; Psalm 139:1-6
	* Relational (desiring connection with humans): Genesis 1:26-27; Isaiah 63:7-14; Revelation 21:2-4

These characteristics and attributes are woven throughout the Bible, providing a comprehensive understanding of God's nature. While we can't fully comprehend His essence, these descriptions help us navigate our relationship with Him.

Remember, the Bible is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16), and its words are inspired by the Holy Spirit. As Christians, we believe that God has revealed Himself to humanity through Scripture, providing a trustworthy guide for understanding who He is and how we can know Him personally.
