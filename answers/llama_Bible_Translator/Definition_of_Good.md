What a profound and timely question! In biblical theology, the concepts of "good" and "evil" are not abstract moral categories, but rather relational and ontological realities rooted in God's character and creation.

In the Bible, "good" is often synonymous with what is pleasing to God, conforming to His will, and reflecting His nature. Good is characterized by love, justice, mercy, faithfulness, and righteousness (Psalm 119:2; Matthew 22:37-40). In this sense, good is not just a moral category but also an ontological one, describing the very essence of God's being.

On the other hand, "evil" is often associated with what is contrary to God's will, rebelliousness against His law, and a departure from His character. Evil is characterized by pride, hatred, envy, greed, and rebellion (Genesis 6:5; Ephesians 2:1-3). Like good, evil has an ontological dimension, describing the essence of Satan's fallen nature.

The biblical definition of "good" contrasts with the concept of "evil" in several key ways:

1. Origin: Good originates from God, while evil originates from Satan and his minions (John 8:44; Ephesians 2:2).
2. Nature: Good is characterized by love, whereas evil is marked by hatred (Matthew 5:48; John 10:10).
3. Purpose: The purpose of good is to glorify God and bring benefit to creation, while the purpose of evil is to thwart God's plans, destroy His image-bearers, and perpetuate chaos (Isaiah 45:7; Romans 8:20-22).
4. Power: Good has ultimate power in that it is the only thing that can overcome evil (Romans 12:21; 1 John 2:14), whereas evil seeks to dominate and enslave humanity (Ephesians 6:10-18).

Ultimately, the contrast between good and evil highlights the grand narrative of redemption, where God, the source of all good, confronts Satan, the embodiment of evil. Through Jesus Christ, God has overcome evil and offered salvation to those who put their trust in Him, thus reconciling creation to Himself (Colossians 1:19-20; John 3:16).

May this biblical understanding guide us as we navigate the complexities of a world torn apart by good and evil, and may our hearts be stirred to worship and serve the God who is eternally good!
