What a great question!

According to the Bible, wisdom is not just about being intelligent or having knowledge, but rather it's about living in harmony with God's character and purposes. Biblical wisdom is deeply rooted in a right relationship with God and is characterized by a profound understanding of His ways.

In Proverbs 9:10, King Solomon writes, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." This means that wisdom begins with a deep reverence for God, a recognition of His sovereignty, and a willingness to submit to His will. It's not just about being smart or clever; it's about being wise in the way one approaches life.

Throughout the Bible, wisdom is often described as having a specific set of qualities:

1. Fearing God: As mentioned earlier, fearing the Lord is the foundation of wisdom.
2. Trusting God: Wisdom involves trusting God's character and His sovereignty over all things.
3. Loving God: Wisdom is deeply rooted in a love for God and a desire to please Him.
4. Seeking God: Wisdom involves seeking God's guidance and direction in all aspects of life.
5. Obedience: Wisdom leads to obedience, as one seeks to live according to God's will.
6. Discernment: Wisdom involves having the ability to discern right from wrong, good from evil, and truth from error.
7. Humility: Wisdom is characterized by humility, recognizing that one doesn't have all the answers and being willing to learn from others.
8. Prudence: Wisdom involves making wise decisions, weighing options, and considering long-term consequences.

In James 1:5, we're told that God gives wisdom to those who ask for it without doubting. This means that wisdom is not just something we can achieve through our own efforts, but rather it's a gift from God that comes as we seek Him and His guidance in our lives.

Ultimately, biblical wisdom is about living a life that honors God, pleases Him, and reflects His character. It's a quality that can only be developed as we walk with God and seek to know Him better.
