## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of guilt is a vital theme in the Bible, and there are numerous examples that illustrate its importance. Here are a few:

1. The story of Adam and Eve (Genesis 2-3): After they disobeyed God's command not to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they felt guilty for their actions. They tried to hide from God and cover themselves with fig leaves. This passage highlights the concept of guilt as a natural response to sin.

2. The story of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-16): When Cain killed his brother Abel out of jealousy, he was filled with guilt and fear. He became a wanderer on earth, unable to settle down due to his own guilt.

3. King David's confession (Psalm 51:1-19): After David committed adultery with Bathsheba and had her husband Uriah killed in battle, he felt immense guilt before God. In Psalm 51, he pours out his heart to God, asking for forgiveness and cleansing from his sin.

4. The prophet Jeremiah's lamentations (Jeremiah 3:1-5): When the Israelites turned away from God and worshipped other gods, they experienced a deep sense of guilt. They knew they had failed God's trust and were now facing His wrath.

5. Jesus' words to the Pharisees (Matthew 23:13-15, 32; Luke 11:42): In his teachings, Jesus highlighted the importance of recognizing one's own guilt before approaching God. He emphasized that people cannot be righteous in their own eyes but must acknowledge their sinfulness and seek forgiveness.

6. The apostle Paul's writings (Romans 3:23-26; Ephesians 2:1-10): Throughout his epistles, Paul emphasizes the universal nature of human guilt before God. He explains that everyone has sinned and fallen short of God's glory, making us all guilty before Him.

7. The story of Jonah (Jonah 1-4): When Jonah disobeyed God's command to go to Nineveh and instead fled on a ship, he became overwhelmed by his own guilt and ran from it. Eventually, he faced the reality of his sin and repented, just as we must acknowledge our own guilt before seeking forgiveness.

These examples illustrate that guilt is an inherent response to sin, and recognizing one's guilt is essential for seeking true forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ.
