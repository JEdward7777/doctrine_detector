## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, an evangelist (or evangelistos in Greek) is specifically mentioned as someone who spreads the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ (Acts 21:8; Ephesians 4:11). The term "evangelist" comes from the Greek word "euangelion," which means "good news" or "gospel."

What distinguishes an evangelist from other Christians is their primary role and responsibility to proclaim the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. Evangelists are called by God to share the Gospel with others, often in a public setting, such as preaching, teaching, or writing.

Some key characteristics that distinguish evangelists include:

1. Passion for sharing the Gospel: Evangelists have a deep passion for sharing the good news of salvation and are motivated by their love for God and people.
2. Gift of communication: Evangelists possess a unique gift for communicating the Gospel in a clear, concise, and compelling manner, often using various forms of media or public speaking.
3. Ability to connect with others: Evangelists are skilled at connecting with people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and denominations, sharing the message in a way that is relevant and applicable to their lives.
4. Leadership role: As leaders, evangelists often serve as role models, mentors, and spiritual guides for others, inspiring them to follow Jesus and share the Gospel with others.
5. Emphasis on personal testimony: Evangelists typically rely heavily on their own personal experiences of salvation and faith, sharing their testimonies to validate the power and relevance of the Gospel.

In contrast, other Christians may have different roles or responsibilities within the Body of Christ, such as pastors, teachers, apostles, prophets, or disciples. While all believers are called to share the Gospel in some way, evangelists are specifically designated by God to be messengers of the good news, focused on spreading the message beyond their local church and community.

In 2 Timothy 4:5, Paul exhorts Timothy to "engage in proclaiming the gospel, whether going or coming." This verse highlights the importance of sharing the Gospel as a core aspect of an evangelist's ministry.
