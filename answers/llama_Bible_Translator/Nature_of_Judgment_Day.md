## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In a Christian context, "judgment day" refers to the biblical concept of the Day of Judgment or the Final Judgment (Hebrews 9:27; Revelation 20:11-15). It is the day when every person who has ever lived will stand before God to give an account of their deeds and words.

According to Scripture, this judgment will take place at the end of time, after Christ's return and the completion of His work on earth (Matthew 25:31-46; Romans 2:5-11). On that day, all people will be gathered before God's throne, and each person's actions, words, and thoughts will be examined and evaluated based on their relationship with Jesus Christ (John 12:48).

The Bible teaches that the Day of Judgment is a time when:

1. The righteous will receive eternal life and glory in heaven (Revelation 20:4-6).
2. The wicked will face eternal punishment, known as hell or the lake of fire, separated from God's presence forever (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:15).
3. Jesus Christ will judge all people based on their response to His gospel message and their obedience to His commands (John 12:48; Romans 2:16).

As Christians, we believe that the Day of Judgment is a solemn reminder of God's justice and our accountability for our actions. It motivates us to live according to God's will, trust in Jesus Christ as our Savior, and look forward to eternal life with Him.

In Christian tradition, this concept has been referred to as "judgment day" or the "Last Judgment." However, it is essential to note that the Bible does not explicitly use the term "judgment day" in its original languages. The phrase is a translation of various passages that describe the final judgment.
