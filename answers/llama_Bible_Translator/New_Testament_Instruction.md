## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, there is no explicit instruction on how to understand or apply the Psalms. However, we can make some observations and draw some conclusions based on the teachings of Jesus Christ and the apostles.

Firstly, Jesus Christ often quoted from the Old Testament, including the Psalms, in his teachings (e.g., Matthew 21:16; Luke 23:46). This shows that Jesus recognized the authority and inspiration of the Psalter. Additionally, Jesus' teachings on prayer, worship, and devotion to God are often rooted in Psalmic passages (e.g., Matthew 6:9-13; John 17:1).

Secondly, the apostle Paul quotes from the Psalms frequently in his epistles (e.g., Romans 11:9; 1 Corinthians 3:20; Hebrews 2:12). He also uses Psalmic language and allusions to illustrate Christian truths and encourage believers (e.g., Romans 8:31-34; 2 Corinthians 6:18).

Thirdly, the apostle Peter writes that Jesus is the one "who was foreordained through holy prophets beforehand by God himself, who has spoken at his right handâ€” 'My Lord, have I not always served you?'" (Acts 10:36). This allusion to Psalm 16:8-11 and other Old Testament passages highlights the importance of the Psalms as a window into understanding Jesus' identity and mission.

Lastly, the New Testament often uses Psalmic motifs and themes to describe Christian experiences and realities. For example, Psalm 23 is used to describe Jesus' care for his sheep (John 10:11), while Psalm 32 is applied to the experience of justification by faith (Romans 4:7-8).

In summary, while there may not be a specific instruction on Psalms in the New Testament, the teachings and practices of Jesus Christ and the apostles demonstrate a deep respect for the Psalter as an inspired and authoritative source of wisdom.
