## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Bible, specifically Genesis 6-9, the primary purpose of Noah's Ark was to save a remnant of humanity and the animals from the catastrophic judgment of God that would destroy all flesh on earth due to its corruption and violence (Genesis 6:5-7, 13).

The Bible says that God saw the wickedness of humanity and decided to send a flood to wipe out all living things except for Noah and those who were with him in the ark. God gave Noah specific instructions to build an ark that would save his family - Noah, his wife, their three sons, and their wives - as well as two of every kind of animal (Genesis 6:13-22).

The ark was a huge vessel, about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high (Genesis 6:15). It was made of gopher wood, covered in pitch, and had three decks. The ark was designed to withstand the massive floodwaters and provide a safe haven for Noah's family and the animals.

The Bible says that Noah built the ark according to God's specifications, and when it was complete, God gave him instructions on how to enter the ark with his family and the animals (Genesis 7:1-5). After seven days of preparation, the rains came, the floodgates of heaven were opened, and a 40-day rain poured down, causing the floodwaters to rise and cover the earth (Genesis 7:11-12).

The ark floated on the waters for 150 days, and when the floodwaters receded, Noah released a dove, raven, and swallow to check if the ground was dry. When the dove did not return, Noah knew that the ground was dry, and he left the ark with his family and the animals (Genesis 8:6-14).

The purpose of the ark, therefore, was to preserve human life and a remnant of animal species from the destruction caused by the flood, allowing God's plan for humanity to continue through Noah's family.
