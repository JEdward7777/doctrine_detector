The phrase "Son of God" (Hebrew: בֶּן אֱלוֹהִים, ben Elohim; Greek: υἱός τοῦ Θεοῦ, huios tou Theou) is a central concept in Christian theology, but I understand how it can be misunderstood. Clarifying this term requires understanding its biblical and theological context.

In the Old Testament, "son of God" (ben Elohim) refers to a divine being or an angelic being who represents God (Job 1:6; 2:1). This phrase is used to describe Jesus in the New Testament, but it's essential to distinguish between its Old Testament usage and Jesus' unique nature as the Messiah.

In Christian theology, Jesus Christ is not considered the physical offspring of God. Instead, He is understood as the divine Son of God who became human (Incarnation). This is often referred to as the "hypostatic union" or the "union of the divine and human natures in one person."

Here are some key factors to consider when clarifying this term:

1. Biblical usage: In the New Testament, Jesus is explicitly called the Son of God by God Himself (Matthew 3:17; 17:5), by angels (Luke 1:32), and by Jesus Himself (John 10:36). This title emphasizes His divine nature and His role as the Messiah.
2. Contextual understanding: The term "Son of God" in the Old Testament is often used to describe a divine being or an angelic being who represents God. In this sense, it's not about physical offspring but rather about representation or agency.
3. Jesus' unique nature: As the Incarnate Son of God, Jesus possesses both human and divine natures (Philippians 2:5-8; Colossians 1:15-20). He is fully human yet fully divine, making Him a unique entity unlike any physical offspring.
4. Theological framework: Within Christian theology, the concept of "sonship" is often understood in terms of representation and agency rather than physical offspring. This perspective emphasizes Jesus' role as the representative of God (Hebrews 1:3; 5:5-6) and His divine authority to act on behalf of God.
5. Cautions against misunderstanding: When using the term "Son of God," it's essential to avoid creating confusion between its Old Testament usage and Jesus' unique nature as the Incarnate Son of God.

To clarify the term "Son of God" for someone who believes it implies physical offspring, you can:

* Emphasize the biblical context and Jesus' unique nature as the Incarnate Son of God.
* Explain that Jesus is not considered the physical offspring of God but rather the divine Son who became human.
* Highlight the theological framework of representation and agency, which emphasizes Jesus' role as the representative of God.
* Use analogies or illustrations to help clarify the concept, such as comparing Jesus to a king's ambassador or a human being representing God on earth.

By providing this clarification and context, you can help individuals understand that "Son of God" refers to Jesus' divine nature and His role as the Messiah, rather than physical offspring.
