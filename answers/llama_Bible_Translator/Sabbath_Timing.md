## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath begins on Friday evening at sunset and ends on Saturday evening at sunset. This is based on Exodus 20:8-11, where God commands Israel to observe the Sabbath by setting apart the seventh day as a holy convocation.

The Jewish Sabbath is observed from Friday night until Saturday night, which is approximately 25 hours in total. The exact timing of the start and end of the Sabbath can vary slightly depending on the location and the observer's tradition, but generally, it is considered to begin at sunset on Friday and end at sunset on Saturday.

In Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed by refraining from work or creative activities, such as lighting fires, writing, or carrying objects. This allows Israelites to rest and reflect on God's creation and redemption.

It's worth noting that while many Christian denominations observe Sunday worship instead of Saturday, some Christians still honor the seventh-day Sabbath as a reminder of Jesus' Jewish roots and the biblical commandment to keep the Sabbath holy (Exodus 20:8-11).
