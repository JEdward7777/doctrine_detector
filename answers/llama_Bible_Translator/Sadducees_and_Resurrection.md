According to the New Testament, the Sadducees were a Jewish sect that rejected the idea of resurrection. In Mark 12:18-23, the Sadducees ask Jesus a question about the resurrection, pretending to be uncertain about it:

"The Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with one of their number and said: 'Teacher, Moses wrote that if a man's brother dies without leaving a son, the man should marry the widow. The subsequent brothers should treat her as a sister-in-law and marry her in order to provide for the deceased brother's offspring. Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his widow to his brother. The second brother married her and died, but since he did not have any children either, he left his widow to his brother. The third brother also married her and died, and the fourth brother also married her and died. In the same way all seven brothers married her and died, leaving no children. Last of all, the woman's husband died too. So in this life, she had seven husbands who were put to death. In the resurrection whose wife will she be? For they all had her as wife'" (Mark 12:18-23).

This question was meant to challenge Jesus' view on the afterlife and the concept of resurrection. The Sadducees believed that the idea of a physical resurrection, where people would be reunited with their bodies and marry again, was absurd.

In contrast, Christian teaching affirms the bodily resurrection of believers at the end of this age. As Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15:50-54:

"I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changedâ€” in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and mortality with immortality."

Jesus himself taught that believers would have a new, glorious body in the resurrection (John 5:28-29; Philippians 3:20-21). The Sadducees' denial of the resurrection was seen as a rejection of God's plan for humanity, which is to bring creation back into a restored state through Jesus Christ.
