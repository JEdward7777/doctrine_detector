## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
A crucial question! The Bible is clear about what it considers abhorrent and detestable in God's eyes. Let me highlight a few examples:

1. Idolatry (Exodus 20:3-5, Deuteronomy 27:15): Worshiping any gods or objects besides the one true God, Yahweh.
2. Homosexuality (Leviticus 18:22, 20:13; Romans 1:26-27): Sexual behavior outside of God's intended design for marriage between a man and woman.
3. Divorce and remarriage (Malachi 2:16; Matthew 5:32, 19:9): Filing for divorce without biblical grounds or remarrying before one's previous spouse has passed away.
4. Murder (Genesis 9:6; Exodus 20:13; Romans 1:29): Willfully taking an innocent human life.
5. Adultery (Exodus 20:17; Leviticus 18:20; Hebrews 13:4): Engaging in sexual intimacy outside of marriage, as well as marital infidelity.
6. Bestiality and animal sacrifices to false gods (Leviticus 18:23; Deuteronomy 27:15): Engaging in unnatural sexual acts with animals or offering them as sacrifices to other deities.
7. False prophets and divination (Deuteronomy 13:1-5, 18:20; Leviticus 19:31; Acts 17:11): Claiming divine revelation from sources other than God's Word, such as astrology, fortune-telling, or witchcraft.
8. Witchcraft, sorcery, and occult practices (Exodus 22:18; Leviticus 19:31; Deuteronomy 18:10-12; Acts 8:9): Engaging in various forms of supernatural manipulation, magic, or mysticism.

It's essential to note that the Bible's condemnation of these practices is not about personal morality or cultural relativism. Rather, it's rooted in God's holiness and His creation ordinances, which He has established for humanity's well-being and flourishing. These abominations are a rejection of God's sovereignty and a disregard for the sacredness of human life.

As Christians, we must be mindful of these biblical principles and strive to honor God by rejecting such practices and promoting righteousness in our lives and communities.
