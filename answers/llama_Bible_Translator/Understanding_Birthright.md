## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob has significant implications for both brothers in the biblical account.

For Esau:

1. Loss of divine blessing: As the elder son, Esau was expected to receive a double portion of inheritance (Deuteronomy 21:17). By selling his birthright, he gave up this right and the accompanying divine blessing.
2. Consequences for rebellion: Esau's actions were an act of rebellion against God and his family. His decision led to spiritual consequences, which are not explicitly stated in Genesis but can be inferred from his later actions (e.g., marrying non-Hebrew women, Genesis 26:34-35; 27:46).
3. Temporary loss of favor with Abraham: Esau's actions may have temporarily put him out of favor with their father, Abraham, who was looking for Isaac to continue the family line (Genesis 24:2-4).

For Jacob:

1. Righteous inheritance: By purchasing the birthright from Esau, Jacob gained the right to inherit the double portion and the accompanying divine blessing.
2. Spiritual momentum: Jacob's actions demonstrated his faithfulness to God and his willingness to work hard for what was rightfully his (Genesis 25:29-34). This spiritual momentum would later carry over into his interactions with Laban and his return to Canaan.
3. Divine favor: Jacob's righteous actions earned him divine favor, which is evident in the blessings he received from Isaac (Genesis 27:1-40) and the promises God made to him (Genesis 28:10-22).

In summary, Esau's decision to sell his birthright had spiritual and temporal consequences for both brothers. Jacob's righteousness and faithfulness, however, earned him divine favor and a righteous inheritance, while Esau's rebellion ultimately led to spiritual consequences that were not explicitly stated in Genesis but can be inferred from his later actions.
