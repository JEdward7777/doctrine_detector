In a spiritual sense, "to perish" (Greek: ἀπόλλυμι, apollymi) in the New Testament typically means to experience eternal separation from God and His love. This concept is closely tied to the biblical teaching of salvation and judgment.

When Jesus speaks about perishing, He often refers to those who reject Him or fail to follow His teachings. In John 10:28, for example, Jesus says, "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish." Here, perishing means being cut off from the source of eternal life, which is a direct relationship with God.

In contrast, the apostle Paul writes that those who are in Christ will not perish (Romans 8:13). This underscores the idea that believers have a secure salvation and will ultimately be spared from eternal judgment.

The concept of perishing is closely tied to the biblical understanding of sin and its consequences. As Romans 6:23 puts it, "The wages of sin is death" – both physical and spiritual. When we sin, we separate ourselves from God's love and risk experiencing eternal separation (spiritual death).

In this sense, perishing represents a state of being cut off from the life-giving presence of God, which is essential for human flourishing and fulfillment. Those who perish are those who refuse to turn to God or reject His offer of salvation through Jesus Christ.

So, in summary, to perish spiritually means to experience eternal separation from God's love, resulting from rejecting Him or failing to follow His teachings. This concept highlights the importance of a personal relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ as the only way to avoid spiritual perishing and receive eternal life.
