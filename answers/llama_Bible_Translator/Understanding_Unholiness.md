## Question [Understanding Unholiness](../../questions/Understanding_Unholiness.md)
What are some characteristics of an 'unholy' life, and how can we identify them in our actions or society?

## Target answer from notes
An 'unholy' life is marked by rebellion against God, actions that dishonor Him, and practices that are not set apart for His glory. This may manifest in behaviors that are common or profane.

## Concern to grade by
This question encourages self-examination and awareness of how unholiness can influence personal and communal behavior.

## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I must emphasize that the concept of "unholy" is deeply rooted in God's revelation to humanity through Scripture. In 1 John 2:15-17, the apostle John writes, "Do not love the world or any thing in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life—is not from God but is from the world."

## Grade
85.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively connects the concept of "unholy" with behaviors that go against God's will and do not glorify Him, aligning well with Christian teachings. The provided Bible verse supports the explanation given. Connecting unholy behaviors to personal and communal influence aligns with the concern of self-examination and awareness. However, further elaboration on how individuals can strive for holiness and resist unholy influences would enhance the response.
