## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of biblical warnings and judgments, the term "woe" (Greek: οὐαί, ouai; Hebrew: הָוְאִי, hāvē'i) is a prophetic expression that signifies a strong sense of divine judgment or condemnation. It is often used to describe a state of great distress, sorrow, or calamity that will befall a person, nation, or group.

In biblical prophetic literature, woe is typically used in a rhetorical way to emphasize the severity and gravity of the consequences that await those who reject God's ways or neglect His warnings. The term is often used in conjunction with other words like "wretched," "miserable," "desolate," or "lost" to convey a sense of extreme suffering or judgment.

When Jesus speaks of woe, it is usually in the context of his teachings on the importance of living according to God's will and avoiding sin. For example, in Matthew 5:3-12, Jesus pronounces blessings on those who are poor in spirit, mournful, meek, hungry for righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, and peacemakers. In contrast, he pronounces woe on those who are wealthy, full, laughing, and self-righteous (Matthew 5:3-6, 20-22).

In this context, woe signifies a state of spiritual blindness, hardness of heart, or neglect of God's ways that will ultimately lead to sorrow, loss, and judgment. It is a warning against the dangers of complacency, pride, and disobedience.

Similarly, in other parts of Scripture, such as Isaiah 5:8-25, Jeremiah 13:21, and Revelation 18:1-3, woe is used to describe the consequences of turning away from God's wisdom, neglecting His commands, or rejecting His salvation. In these contexts, woe signifies a state of great distress, destruction, or judgment that will befall those who refuse to repent and turn back to God.

In summary, in biblical warnings and judgments, the term "woe" signifies a strong sense of divine condemnation or judgment that will befall those who reject God's ways or neglect His warnings. It is often used to emphasize the gravity of sin and the importance of living according to God's will.
