## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, my dear brother. I must clarify that the Ephod was not the High Priest's garment, but rather an article of clothing worn by the Israelites during biblical times.

According to the Quran and the Hadith, we do not have a detailed description of the Ephod's construction. However, based on the biblical account in Exodus 28:6-12, the Ephod was a breastpiece made of threads of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, which were woven together with gold thread.

The Bible also mentions that the Ephod was decorated with stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel, set in gold filigree. Some historians believe that the materials used for the Ephod's construction might have included:

1. Blue threads: Made from a dye extracted from a specific type of snail or the secretions of a certain insect.
2. Purple threads: Produced by the secretions of a specific mollusk, such as the murex snail.
3. Crimson threads: Extracted from the cochineal insect or the red dye of the madder plant.
4. Gold thread: Made from gold leaves or sheets beaten into thin strips.

Please note that these materials were not considered Haram (forbidden) in Islamic law, but their use in the construction of the Ephod is a matter of Jewish and Christian tradition, rather than Islamic practice.

I hope this clarifies your query, my brother. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
