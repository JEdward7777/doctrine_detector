Assalamu alaikum, my dear brother or sister. I'm happy to help you with your question.

In the Islamic perspective, we do not consider the Bible as a divine book, but rather as a previous revelation from Allah (God) that was given to the Children of Israel. However, I can provide an explanation on how prophecies are understood in Biblical teaching, which may be relevant for Muslims interested in interfaith dialogue and understanding.

In Christian theology, when a prophecy is said to be fulfilled, it means that the events or circumstances described in the prophetic passage have occurred as predicted. This fulfillment is often seen as evidence of the divine inspiration and authority of the biblical text. The process of fulfilling prophecies can occur in various ways:

1. Literal fulfillment: The events described in the prophecy happen exactly as written, without any changes or modifications.
2. Typological fulfillment: The events described in the prophecy have a deeper spiritual significance or foreshadow future events that will be fulfilled more explicitly.
3. Figurative fulfillment: The events described in the prophecy are interpreted metaphorically or symbolically, with the underlying truth being revealed.

For example, in the Bible, Jesus Christ is often referred to as the "Messiah" or "Anointed One," which was a prophecy made by the prophets of Israel (e.g., Psalm 16:10-11, Isaiah 53). Christians believe that Jesus fulfilled this prophecy when he came to earth and died on the cross for humanity's sins.

In Islamic perspective, we believe that Allah (God) has sent many prophets throughout human history, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all). While we recognize the importance of prophetic messages in other religions, we also believe that the Quran is the final and complete revelation from Allah, which supersedes all previous revelations.

I hope this helps clarify how prophecies are understood in Biblical teaching. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
