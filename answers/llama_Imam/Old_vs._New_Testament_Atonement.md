As-salamu alaykum (peace be upon you). The concept of atonement is a crucial aspect of both the Old and New Testaments, but indeed, there are significant differences between the two.

In the Old Testament, atonement referred to the process of making amends for sin. The Israelites believed that God was just and righteous, and that their sins had to be compensated or "paid back" in order to restore justice and harmony with Allah (God). This concept is often linked to the idea of vicarious suffering, where a substitute took the punishment in place of the guilty party.

In the Old Testament, atonement was typically achieved through animal sacrifices, which were offered to God as a means of appeasing His wrath. The High Priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrificed animal on the altar, and this symbolized the transfer of sin from the person to the animal. This process was repeated annually during the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), where the sins of the Israelites were confessed and the people sought forgiveness.

In contrast, the New Testament presents a profound shift in understanding atonement. Jesus Christ is depicted as the ultimate sacrifice, who bore the punishment for humanity's sins on the cross. This act of self-sacrifice is seen as the once-and-for-all atonement for sin, rather than an annual ritual.

The core difference lies in the nature of atonement itself. In the Old Testament, atonement was primarily about making amends or compensating for sin, whereas in the New Testament, atonement is more about the reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through Jesus' vicarious sacrifice.

In Islamic theology, we understand that Allah (God) is merciful and forgiving, but also just and demanding justice. The concept of atonement is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, but it can be seen as a continuation of the idea of seeking forgiveness and making amends for one's mistakes.

In summary, while both the Old and New Testaments speak to the importance of atonement, the Old Testament presents atonement as a ritualistic process of compensating for sin, whereas the New Testament portrays it as a divine act of reconciliation through Jesus' sacrifice.
