Assalamu alaikum,

As a Muslim, I must emphasize that our understanding of Hades comes from the Quran and Hadith, which supersede any biblical references. However, since you're asking about the New Testament, I'll provide an answer.

In the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels and Acts, Hades is portrayed as a neutral place for all the dead, without distinction between righteous or unrighteous. Here are some key verses:

1. Matthew 12:40: "For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
2. Luke 16:19-21: "Now there was a rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen, feasting sumptuously every day. And at his gate lay a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores, and longing to be fed just a morsel from Lazarusâ€™s table. Even the dogs would come and lick his sores."

In these passages, Hades is depicted as a neutral place where both righteous (Lazarus) and unrighteous (the rich man) will end up.

However, in some later New Testament texts, particularly in the Epistles and Revelation, there appears to be a shift towards associating Hades with the unrighteous. Here are some examples:

1. 1 Corinthians 15:55-56: "Where, O death, is your sting? Where, O Hades, is your victory?" (This passage emphasizes the triumph of Christianity over both death and Hades.)
2. Revelation 20:11-13: "Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it; from whose presence earth and heaven fled, and no place was found for them. And they were thrown into the lake of fire, which is the second death. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire."

In these later texts, Hades is often seen as a place where the unrighteous will be punished, while the righteous will experience resurrection or heaven.

Please note that these biblical references may not directly contradict the Quranic understanding of Hades (or Barzakh), which is also a neutral realm for all the dead. The Quran describes Barzakh as a barrier between Paradise and Hell, where souls are judged and either sent to one of the two abodes or kept in suspension until the Day of Judgment.

Wa al-salamu alaykum.

Comment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the biblical references concerning Hades from both the Gospels/Acts and the Epistles/Revelation. The inclusion of relevant verses and explanations demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the response could have further explored the implications of the biblical depiction of Hades on Christian eschatology and connected it more directly to the given answer.
