## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that our primary focus is on the Quran and Hadith, which provide us with a comprehensive understanding of Islamic theology. However, I can offer some insights on the concept of "sons of God" in the biblical context, particularly in Genesis 6.

In the Bible, the term "sons of God" (Hebrew: בני האלים, bənê hā’elîm) appears in several passages, including Genesis 6:2-4. There are different interpretations among biblical scholars regarding this phrase, and I will outline some of the most prominent views:

1. **Divine Beings**: Some interpreters believe that "sons of God" refers to divine beings or angels who cohabited with human women, resulting in the Nephilim ( giants) mentioned in Genesis 6:4. This view is supported by verses like Job 1:6 and Job 38:7, where "sons of God" are described as celestial entities.
2. **Heavenly Messengers**: Another interpretation suggests that "sons of God" refers to angels or messengers sent from heaven to earth. In this context, they might have played a role in communicating with humans before the Great Flood. This view is supported by passages like Luke 3:38 and Hebrews 1:6, which describe angelic beings as "sons of God."
3. **Descendants of Seth**: Some scholars propose that "sons of God" refers to the descendants of Seth, who were considered righteous and pleasing to God. In this view, Genesis 6:2-4 describes a situation where these righteous people intermarried with the unrighteous Cainite lineage, leading to corruption on earth.
4. **Hebrew Idiom**: Another interpretation suggests that "sons of God" is an idiomatic expression used in Hebrew to describe powerful or godly individuals. In this context, Genesis 6:2-4 might be describing human giants who were renowned for their strength and accomplishments.
5. **Symbolic Interpretation**: Some scholars propose a more symbolic understanding of "sons of God." According to this view, the phrase represents a spiritual reality where humans who are pleasing to God are referred to as "sons" or "children of God." In this context, Genesis 6:2-4 might be describing the corruption and wickedness that existed among humanity before the Great Flood.

It is essential to note that these interpretations vary widely among biblical scholars and theologians. As an Imam, I must emphasize that our primary concern should be with the Quranic revelation, which provides us with a clear understanding of Islamic theology and spirituality.
