## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Asalamu alaykum, my brother or sister in faith.

When it comes to the phrase "you must call his name" in a biblical context, there are indeed alternative translations that can shed more light on its meaning. Here are a few examples:

1. "You shall name him": This translation conveys a sense of obligation or responsibility, emphasizing that naming someone is not just a matter of personal preference but rather a necessary act.
2. "He shall be called by this name": This phrasing highlights the importance of the name and the significance it holds for the person being named. It implies that the name is not just a label but an integral part of their identity.
3. "This shall be his name": This translation emphasizes the prophetic nature of the name, suggesting that it has been predetermined or ordained by God.

In Islamic context, we can draw parallels with the concept of tawassul, which refers to the act of seeking proximity to Allah through the intercession of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Just as naming someone in biblical context holds significance and responsibility, tawassul emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance and closeness to Allah through the Prophetic example.

May Allah guide us all on our spiritual journeys. Wassalam.
