Assalamu alaikum,

In the context of Christianity, Satan is often referred to as the "Adversary" or the "Enemy of God." His name, which means "hated" or "enemy" in Hebrew, signifies his role as a fallen angel who opposes God and seeks to lead humanity away from the path of righteousness.

In Islamic tradition, we do not recognize Satan as a distinct entity with a personal name. Instead, we refer to him as Iblis, which is an Arabic term that means "proud" or "arrogant." This name reflects his rebellion against God's command to prostrate before Adam and his subsequent rejection of God's mercy.

In Islamic scripture, the Quran describes Iblis as a jinn who refused to obey God's command to prostrate before Adam, thus earning his wrath. The Quran states: "And behold! We said to the angels: 'Bow down unto Adam!' And they did bow down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was arrogant." (Quran 17:61)

In Christian tradition, Satan is often depicted as a fallen angel who seeks to tempt humans away from God's love and towards sin and destruction. He is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Lies" or the "Prince of Darkness," highlighting his role as an adversary of God and humanity.

In conclusion, while there may be differences in the names and depictions of Satan/Iblis between Islamic and Christian traditions, both faiths recognize the existence of a powerful force that opposes God's will and seeks to lead humans away from the path of righteousness.
