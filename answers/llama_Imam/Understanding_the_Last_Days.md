## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I'd like to clarify that our understanding of the "Last Days" is slightly different from the Christian perspective. In Islam, the Last Days refer to the End Times, which are characterized by signs and events that will occur before the final judgment and the return of Jesus (peace be upon him), also known as 'Isa in Arabic.

In Islamic eschatology, Jesus' first coming refers to his birth and life on earth as a prophet and messenger of Allah. His second coming is mentioned in several Hadiths (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) and is believed to occur before the Day of Judgment.

According to Islamic teachings, when Jesus returns, he will be accompanied by 'Eisa ibn Maryam' (Jesus, son of Mary), who will be sent back to earth to rule with justice and fairness. This event is seen as a sign of the approaching End Times and the final judgment.

In this context, the Last Days signify a period of chaos, turmoil, and moral decay on earth, which will precede Jesus' return. During this time, many people will be misled by false prophets and false deities, leading to further chaos and destruction.

The Last Days are also marked by the appearance of various signs, including:

1. The Dajjal (Antichrist), a false prophet who will claim to be Allah's messenger.
2. The rising of the sun from the west, which is considered a sign of the approaching End Times.
3. The increasing darkness on earth and the decrease in good deeds.

It is important to note that Islam does not believe in predestination or predetermination, unlike some Christian interpretations. Instead, we believe that humanity has free will, and their choices and actions during this period will ultimately determine their fate in the afterlife.

In conclusion, the Last Days in Islamic eschatology signify a period of turmoil and chaos preceding Jesus' return, which is believed to mark the beginning of the end times. During this period, signs and events will occur that will test humanity's faith, morals, and values.
