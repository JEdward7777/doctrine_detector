I'm happy to provide an answer that's inclusive and respectful to all individuals, regardless of their faith or background.

The names of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ can be found in three different books of the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, we find the list in chapter 10, verse 2-4, where it says: "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who was called Peter), then Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot."

## Grade
80.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately provides the names of the twelve apostles as found in the Gospel of Matthew, aligning with the given answer. However, the concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings could have been addressed more explicitly in the response, such as by briefly mentioning the significance of the twelve apostles in the ministry of Jesus.
