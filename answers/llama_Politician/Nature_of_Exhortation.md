## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful topic! *clears throat* As we explore the teachings of the New Testament regarding exhortation, I want to emphasize that we must prioritize sensitivity and compassion in our interactions with one another. After all, as Christians, we are called to be "ambassadors for Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:20).

In regards to exhortation specifically, the New Testament teaches us that it is a vital aspect of Christian community and growth. As Paul writes in Hebrews 3:13, "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 'Today,' so that none of you will be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."

Comment: The response effectively incorporates the concern of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner by emphasizing the importance of prioritizing sensitivity and compassion in interactions. It also references the biblical teaching to encourage one another daily, showcasing a good understanding of exhortation in a Christian context. However, a more direct connection to the provided response about exhorting in love could have been made to strengthen the overall coherence of the response.
