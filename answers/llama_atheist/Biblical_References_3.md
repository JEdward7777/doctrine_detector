## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must emphasize that my responses will be grounded in historical and cultural analysis rather than theological or religious perspectives.

In the Old Testament, the term "Son of Man" (Hebrew: בן אדם, ben adam) appears 14 times in Ezekiel 2:1-3:15. In this context, it refers to a divine figure who is prophesied to appear as a human-like being, often symbolizing God's presence or judgment.

One key reference that contributes to the understanding of the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah is Daniel 7:13-14, which speaks of a divine figure who is given dominion over all nations and peoples. This passage may have influenced Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah, who would be a human-like figure with divine authority.

Another important reference is Psalm 8:4-6, which describes a mortal man being exalted to the level of God's angels. Some interpreters suggest that this psalm may have been seen as a prototype for the concept of the "Son of Man" – a human-like figure who would be elevated to divine status.

Additionally, in Daniel 7:22-28, a divine figure is described who is given authority over all nations and peoples. This passage may have also influenced Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah, who would be a human-like figure with divine authority.

It's essential to note that these references were not necessarily interpreted as referring to a future Messiah in the classical sense during the Old Testament period. Instead, they likely represented various prophetic or apocalyptic themes related to God's presence, judgment, or salvation.

In summary, while the term "Son of Man" is most prominent in Ezekiel, other Old Testament references like Daniel 7 and Psalm 8 may have contributed to the cultural landscape that would later influence Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah.
