## Question [Building Materials](../../questions/Building_Materials.md)
What materials were commonly used to construct altars during biblical times?

## Target answer from notes

## Concern to grade by
Knowing the materials and structure of altars can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship.

## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I'm happy to provide a fact-based response that avoids any value judgments or assumptions about the religious significance of altars.

During biblical times, which roughly spanned from around 1500 BCE to 500 CE, the materials used for constructing altars varied depending on the culture and region. Here are some common materials found in ancient Israelite, Jewish, and Mediterranean cultures:

1. Stone: Natural stone was a popular choice for altar construction. The Israelites, for example, built the altar of stones (Exodus 20:25) and the Temple altar was made of cedar wood overlaid with gold, but had a foundation of stones (1 Kings 5:17).
2. Wood: Wooden altars were common in ancient Mediterranean cultures. In biblical times, wooden altars might have been used for private or family worship.
3. Earth/Clay: Some altars were constructed using the earth or clay. For example, the Israelites built an altar of unhewn stones and earth (Joshua 8:31-32).
4. Brick: Fired bricks made from clay were also used in ancient Mesopotamian and Mediterranean cultures.
5. Marble/Granite: Wealthy civilizations like the Egyptians and Assyrians might have used marble or granite for their altars, as these materials were valued for their durability and aesthetic appeal.

It's essential to note that these materials weren't necessarily used exclusively for religious purposes. Many ancient cultures built structures using these materials for various functions, including practical, ritualistic, and symbolic purposes.

As an atheist, I'm curious about the cultural significance of altars during biblical times. How do you think their construction and use influenced the development of beliefs and practices in those societies?

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a detailed and informative overview of the materials used for constructing altars in biblical times, which aligns well with the concern of deepening a Christian's understanding of biblical practices. However, the initial response being from an atheist perspective and emphasizing a purely historical and cultural context without acknowledging the spiritual significance of altars in Christian worship might not fully resonate with a Christian worldview. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating the spiritual aspects tied to altar construction and usage within the Christian faith.
