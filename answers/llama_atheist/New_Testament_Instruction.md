## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A great question! As an atheist, I must acknowledge that the Christian tradition has a rich and complex relationship with the Psalms. While the Psalms are primarily an Old Testament text, the New Testament does provide some interesting instructions and allusions regarding their interpretation.

One key instruction can be found in the Epistle of Hebrews (13:15). The author writes, "Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name." Here, the author encourages believers to offer spiritual sacrifices, including psalms and hymns (Hebrews 13:15-16), as a means of worshiping and honoring God.

In addition to this explicit instruction, the New Testament also contains several allusions to specific Psalms. For example, Jesus' words on the cross in Luke 23:46 echo Psalm 31:5, "Into thy hand I commit my spirit." Similarly, Paul's declaration in Romans 11:9-10 that God has not cast away his people is a reference to Psalm 94:14.

The New Testament also contains several accounts of early Christian worship practices, which often included the recitation or singing of psalms. For instance, Luke describes the apostles and their companions as "praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people" (Acts 13:52), suggesting that psalm-singing was a common feature of early Christian gatherings.

Overall, while the New Testament does not provide a comprehensive instruction on how to interpret or use the Psalms, it does offer glimpses into the importance of these ancient hymns in Christian worship and devotion.

Comment: The response provides a well-thought-out explanation of how biblical teachings regarding singing psalms apply to contemporary Christian worship. The student effectively references specific instructions and allusions from the New Testament to support their argument. The only area for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or suggestions on how contemporary Christians can incorporate the singing of psalms into their worship practices.
