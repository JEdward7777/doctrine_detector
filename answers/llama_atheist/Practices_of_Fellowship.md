## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A great question! As an atheist, I must approach this inquiry without the constraints of religious doctrine or dogma. Instead, I'll rely on historical records and cultural anthropology to shed light on how early Christians expressed their sense of community.

In the context of ancient Mediterranean cultures, the concept of fellowship was deeply rooted in shared experiences, mutual aid, and social bonding. Early Christian communities inherited this tradition, adapting it to their own unique circumstances.

One significant way early Christians demonstrated fellowship was through communal meals (agape feasts). These gatherings served as a symbol of unity, love, and equality among members. The apostle Paul emphasized the importance of these shared meals in his epistles, highlighting their role in fostering a sense of belonging and social cohesion.

Another aspect of Christian fellowship was the sharing of resources. According to Acts 2:44-45, the early Christian community in Jerusalem sold their possessions and distributed the proceeds among one another, ensuring that no one went without necessities. This practice reflected their commitment to mutual support and care for one another's well-being.

Early Christians also expressed their fellowship through shared worship, prayer, and the breaking of bread (1 Corinthians 10:16-17). These communal rituals served as a focal point for their collective identity and reinforced their sense of belonging to a larger community.

In addition, early Christian communities often gathered in small groups or "house churches" (Acts 2:46; 5:42), which allowed for more intimate connections and informal networks. This decentralized structure enabled Christians to form strong bonds with one another, as they shared life's challenges and celebrated each other's successes.

Lastly, the concept of "brotherly love" (phileo) or "agape" played a crucial role in early Christian fellowship. These terms conveyed a deep affection, compassion, and selfless devotion that characterized the relationships within these communities.

In summary, early Christians expressed their fellowship through communal meals, shared resources, collective worship, small-group gatherings, and a culture of brotherly love. By embracing these practices, they created a strong sense of community that was deeply rooted in shared values, mutual support, and social bonding.
