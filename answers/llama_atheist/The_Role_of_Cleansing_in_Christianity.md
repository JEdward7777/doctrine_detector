## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of biblical interpretation! As a scholar, I approach this topic with a critical eye, seeking to understand the cultural and historical contexts that shape the text.

In the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), "cleansing" or "purification" (Hebrew: tahor) is often associated with removing ritual impurity, which can be contracted through contact with certain substances, people, or activities. This concept was deeply rooted in Israelite culture and was closely tied to their understanding of God's holiness and the need for separation from defilement.

In the New Testament, Jesus' teachings on sin and redemption offer a radical departure from this Old Testament understanding of cleansing. Rather than emphasizing ritual purity, Jesus focuses on the heart and the nature of human relationships with God and others. In this context, "cleansing" takes on a new meaning.

For example, in John 13:1-10, Jesus washes his disciples' feet as an act of service and humility, demonstrating that true cleanliness comes from selfless love and obedience to God's will. Similarly, in Luke 11:37-41, Jesus confronts the Pharisees about their inner uncleanness (i.e., their spiritual state), implying that true cleansing requires a transformation of heart, not just external ritual.

In this New Testament context, sin is no longer primarily viewed as ritual impurity but rather as a fundamental separation from God and His will. Redemption, therefore, is understood as the process by which humans are reconciled to God through faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 3:24-26). This reconciliation involves not just the removal of external impurities but also the transformation of one's inner being.

In this sense, Jesus' teachings on cleansing can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual process of sanctification, where believers are gradually conformed to God's character through the power of the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:29-30). This process is not just about removing external stains but also about cultivating inner purity and righteousness.

In conclusion, while the concept of "cleansing" in the Bible has its roots in Old Testament ritual purity, Jesus' teachings in the New Testament offer a profound recontextualization. For Jesus, true cleansing comes from heart transformation, selfless love, and obedience to God's will, ultimately pointing to the redemptive work of Christ on behalf of humanity.
