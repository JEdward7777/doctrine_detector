What a fascinating question!

As an atheist, I'll approach this inquiry from a historical and cultural perspective, without any theological bias.

In the early Christian era, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles (non-Jews) played a significant role in shaping their relationships with them. The Israelites had a distinct understanding of themselves as God's chosen people, set apart by covenant and tradition. This sense of superiority was deeply rooted in their cultural and religious identity.

In Jewish thought, Gentiles were often viewed as "others" â€“ outsiders who didn't share the same divine revelation or covenantal responsibilities. The concept of "separation" (kasherut) was crucial; Jews believed they had a unique relationship with God, which required them to maintain certain boundaries and distinctions from non-Jews.

This perception influenced Jewish-Christian relationships in several ways:

1. **Initial skepticism**: Many early Christians, including Jewish believers, were hesitant to engage with Gentiles, considering them "uncircumcised" and thus inferior. This attitude was rooted in the belief that salvation was reserved for the Jews, as they had received God's revelation through Moses.
2. **Dichotomy between Jew and Gentile**: The apostle Paul, in particular, struggled with this issue (Galatians 2:11-14). He recognized that Jesus' message was meant for all people, regardless of their ethnic background. However, the early Christian community remained divided along these lines, with some Jews viewing Gentiles as inferior and others embracing them as equals.
3. **Missionary efforts**: As Christianity spread among Gentiles, Jewish believers began to reassess their relationships with non-Jews. Some, like Stephen (Acts 6:1-7), emphasized the universality of Jesus' message, while others, like Peter (Acts 10:1-48), recognized the importance of evangelizing Gentiles.
4. **The apostolic council**: The Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15:1-35) marked a significant turning point in Jewish-Christian relationships. James, the brother of Jesus, and other leaders acknowledged that God had made it possible for Gentiles to receive salvation through faith in Christ, without needing to become Jews first.
5. **Evangelization and inclusion**: As Christianity continued to spread, Jewish believers began to see Gentiles as equals, recognizing that salvation was available to all who placed their trust in Jesus Christ. This shift towards inclusivity laid the groundwork for the early Christian church's expansion beyond its Jewish roots.

In conclusion, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles played a significant role in shaping early Christian relationships. Initially, there was skepticism and division, but as the apostles and other leaders recognized God's universal plan, they began to see Gentiles as equals, paving the way for the spread of Christianity beyond its Jewish origins.

Comment: While the response provides a detailed exploration of the historical and cultural perspectives on Jewish-Gentile relationships in early Christianity, it falls short of addressing the theological implications from a Christian-specific worldview. The answer does not acknowledge the transformative work of Jesus Christ in breaking down barriers between Jews and Gentiles in the early church, which is crucial from a Christian perspective. A more substantial integration of Christian theology and the redemptive work of Christ would have strengthened the response in addressing the concern raised.
