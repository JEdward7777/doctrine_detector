## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The "abomination of desolation" refers to an event prophesied by the Old Testament prophet Daniel (Daniel 9:27, 11:31; 12:11) and fulfilled in Jewish history during the time of the Maccabees (1 Maccabees 1:54-64). However, Jesus in Matthew 24:15 refers to this event as a future sign of the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by the Romans.

In the context of Jesus' teaching in Matthew 24, the "abomination of desolation" is one of several signs that will precede the coming of the Son of Man (Jesus) and the end of the age. When the Jewish people see this abomination, they are to flee to the mountains to escape the impending destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.

The term "abomination" suggests something that is detestable to God, and in this context, it likely refers to a desecration or defilement of the temple, perhaps by an idol being set up within its sacred precincts. The exact nature of the abomination in future fulfillment is still subject to interpretation among scholars.

In summary, the "abomination of desolation" is a significant prophetic sign that marks the imminent destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, as well as the end times for the Christian community. It reminds believers to remain vigilant, faithful, and expectant for the return of Christ.
