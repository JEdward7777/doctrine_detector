## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The significance of Jesus sending the apostles to spread the Gospel is profound and fundamental to Christian theology. In the New Testament, Jesus' commissioning of His disciples to proclaim the Good News has several key implications:

1. **Mission Continuation**: Jesus' death and resurrection were not just personal events but had cosmic significance. The sending of the apostles was a continuation of God's redemptive plan, which began with creation and culminated in Christ.

2. **Authority and Validation**: By sending the apostles, Jesus entrusted them with His authority to teach and act in His name (Matthew 10:7-8, Matthew 28:19-20). This commission validates the apostles' messages and ministry as authentic representatives of Christ.

3. **Universal Reach**: The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) tells us that Jesus commissioned His disciples to make disciples of all nations, signifying that the Gospel was intended for every people group on earth. This global mission is a testament to God's heart for all humanity and the inclusivity of salvation through Christ.

4. **Continuation of Jesus' Ministry**: After His resurrection, Jesus promised His disciples that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit came upon them (Acts 1:8). This empowerment enabled them to carry on Jesus' work and spread the Gospel boldly, even in the face of adversity.

5. **Formation of the Church**: As the apostles preached and established local communities of believers, they laid the foundation for the Christian Church (Ephesians 2:19-20). The Church continues to be God's primary means of sharing the Good News with a lost world.

In summary, the sending of the apostles by Jesus was essential to the continuation of God's redemptive plan, the validation and spread of the Gospel, and the formation of the Church. It demonstrated Christ's love for all people and His desire for everyone to know Him personally.
