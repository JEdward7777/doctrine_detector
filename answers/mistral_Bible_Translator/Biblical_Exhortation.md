## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the New Testament, Jesus gave his apostles a directive regarding the "good news" (Gospel) in Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV):

19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

Here, Jesus commands his apostles to go out and make disciples (teach people to follow him) among all nations (people groups), baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he has commanded. He also assures them that he will always be with them, to the end of the age. This is commonly known as the Great Commission, which underscores the Christian responsibility for evangelism and discipleship.

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a strong explanation of Jesus' directive to the apostles to spread the good news and make disciples, aligning well with the Great Commission. It demonstrates an understanding of evangelism as a key aspect of the Christian faith. The only slight improvement could be adding a bit more emphasis on the call to baptize and teach obedience in addition to spreading the good news.
