 In the Bible, several passages highlight the concept of covenant faithfulness between God and His people. Here are a few examples:

1. Genesis 9:9 - "And I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you." This passage shows God's covenant with Noah, emphasizing His faithfulness to keep His promises.

2. Exodus 6:7 - "I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians." This verse underscores God's faithfulness in keeping His promises to His chosen people, the Israelites.

3. Deuteronomy 7:9 - "Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love Him and keep His commandments, to a thousand generations." This verse emphasizes God's faithfulness to those who are faithful to Him.

4. Jeremiah 31:3 - "I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness I have drawn you." This verse speaks of God's unfailing, covenant love for His people.

5. Luke 22:20 - "And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, 'This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood.'" In this New Testament passage, Jesus establishes a new covenant with His followers, emphasizing God's faithfulness to fulfill His promises.
