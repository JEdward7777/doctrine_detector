## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, there are numerous verses that refer to God as the "Most High," emphasizing His supremacy, sovereignty, and divine nature. Here are some examples:

1. Deuteronomy 32:8 (NIV) - "When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God." This verse underscores God's sovereignty over all nations and His ability to divide and govern them.

2. Psalm 97:9 (NIV) - "For you, LORD, are the Most High over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods." This verse emphasizes God's supremacy over all other gods or deities, affirming His unique and singular position as the one true God.

3. Isaiah 14:14 (NIV) - "I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon." This verse, spoken by Satan in his pride before his fall, contrasts God's supremacy with the rebellion and false claims of other beings.

4. Daniel 4:2 (NIV) - "King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: The Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes." This verse reinforces God's sovereignty over human rulers and nations.

These verses, among many others, reveal that God is the ultimate authority, the highest power, and the one who governs all things according to His will. His character is one of supremacy, sovereignty, wisdom, justice, love, and faithfulness.
