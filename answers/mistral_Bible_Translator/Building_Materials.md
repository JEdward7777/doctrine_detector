## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 During Biblical times, several materials were used to construct altars based on the specific practices and traditions of different cultures and religions described in the Old Testament. Here are some examples:

1. Stone or unhewn stones: The Tabernacle and later Solomon's Temple had bronze altars built on a foundation of unhewn stones (Exodus 20:25, Deuteronomy 27:6). In other instances, altars were constructed from large stones that were stacked or arranged in a specific manner (Genesis 8:20, Genesis 13:4, Joshua 8:30-31).

2. Earth and unbaked bricks: Altar structures made of earth and unbaked bricks were also used (Joshua 8:31, Jeremiah 7:22, Amos 5:25).

3. Wood: On occasion, altars were constructed using wood (Genesis 33:20, Judges 6:26).

4. Metal: Some altars were made from metal, such as the brazen altar built by Bezalel in the Tabernacle (Exodus 37:1-9) and the bronze altar in Solomon's Temple (2 Chronicles 4:1).

5. Ram's horns and bull's horns: Altars made from rams or bulls' horns were also mentioned, though they may have been temporary structures used for specific sacrifices (Exodus 24:4-5, Leviticus 4:7, 9, Numbers 29:8).

It is essential to note that these examples reflect various practices and traditions found in the Old Testament. The use of a particular material might signify a specific cultural or religious context. In Christian theology, we find our focus on the sacrifices made by Jesus Christ rather than the construction of altars themselves (Hebrews 10:1-14).
