## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In ancient Jewish society, as outlined in the Old Testament, the priestly hierarchy was quite structured, with the High Priest serving as the chief religious authority among the Israelites. This role was held by Aaron and his descendants, according to Exodus 28:1. The High Priest's responsibilities included performing various rituals on behalf of the community, entering the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement, and administering religious law.

The ordinary priests, often referred to as Levites (since they were descendants of the tribe of Levi), assisted the High Priest in temple duties. They were responsible for maintaining the tabernacle or temple, offering sacrifices, teaching Torah, and acting as judges during legal proceedings. However, their authority was subordinate to that of the High Priest.

During Jesus's time, the chief priests (specifically the Sadducees) and ordinary priests (often Pharisees) might have had differing interpretations and philosophies on religious matters, contributing to tensions within Jewish society. The Sanhedrin, a supreme council of 71 members, was comprised mainly of high priests and elders from various families who would discuss and decide upon legal matters, making them the ultimate authority in religious law at that time.

In Christian contexts, the priesthood is often seen as a spiritual representation of Jesus Christ's role as our High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16). Ordinary believers are also considered priests, with access to God through Jesus, and each individual plays an essential part in serving and worshipping Him.
