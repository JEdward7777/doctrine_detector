## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Bible, when a Christian is tempted to sin, they should resist the temptation and seek God's help to overcome it. Here are a few biblical passages that provide guidance on this matter:

1. James 4:7 - "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."

2. Matthew 6:13 - "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."

3. 1 Corinthians 10:13 - "No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it."

4. 1 Corinthians 10:14 - "Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry."

5. Ephesians 6:13-18 - "Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."

In summary, a Christian should seek God's help to resist temptation, flee from idolatry, and stand firm in their faith by wearing the armor of God (truth, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation, and the Word of God). They should also pray for deliverance from evil and temptation.

Comment: The response addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of confessing sins and seeking God's forgiveness for strength to fight against sin. However, it could be improved by specifically incorporating the biblical passages provided in the original response as examples of how Christians should resist temptation and acknowledge personal sin in light of God's forgiveness. Integrating the scriptural references would strengthen the Christian worldview perspective in the response.
