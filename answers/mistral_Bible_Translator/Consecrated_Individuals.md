## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, there are several individuals who were consecrated or dedicated to God. Here are a few examples:

1. Samuel (1 Samuel 1): Samuel was born to Hannah, who prayed for a son and promised to dedicate him to the Lord. When he was young, Samuel served in the temple under Eli the priest and eventually became one of the most significant prophets in Israel's history.

2. Nazirites (Numbers 6): The Nazirite vow was a special consecration to God. Individuals who took this vow abstained from wine, grapes, and all other intoxicants, did not cut their hair, and avoided contact with dead bodies. Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist were notable Nazirites in the Bible.

3. Mary (Luke 1): According to Luke's Gospel, when the angel Gabriel announced that Mary would give birth to Jesus, she replied, "Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word." In this way, Mary was consecrated to God as the mother of Jesus.

4. Samuel's sons (1 Samuel 8): Although they did not choose their consecration, Samuel's sons were appointed as priests by their father, but they corrupted their positions through greed and neglect of their duties. This led to the Israelites requesting a king instead of having God's chosen leaders.

5. King David (1 Chronicles 28:9): In this passage, God consecrates King David for building the temple in Jerusalem, even though he was not allowed to actually do the construction work due to being a warrior and unclean.

6. Jesus Christ (Luke 2:22-38): According to Luke's Gospel, Joseph and Mary took Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem to present him to the Lord as required by Jewish law (Leviticus 12:2-8). In addition, Simeon, a devout man, recognized Jesus as the promised Messiah when he saw him in the temple.

These examples demonstrate that consecration to God is a significant theme throughout the Bible and often involves individuals being set apart for special service or roles within God's plan for humanity.
