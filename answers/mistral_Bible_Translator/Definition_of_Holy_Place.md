## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of both the Tabernacle and the Temple in the Old Testament, the "Holy Place" (also known as the "Holy of Holies" in some translations) was a sacred space where God's presence dwelt among the Israelites. This place was part of the larger structure that included the courtyard, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place (or Holy of Holies).

The Holy Place, which is also known as the Hekel in Hebrew, served as a buffer between the profane world outside and the most sacred space within â€“ the Most Holy Place. It was where priests performed their daily duties such as lighting the lamps, placing incense on the altar, and arranging the bread of the Presence (Exodus 26:31-35; 40:5-8).

The significance of the Holy Place lies in its role as a symbol of God's presence among his people. It represented a place where the Israelites could approach and connect with God through the priests who acted as intermediaries. The rituals performed there, such as offering sacrifices, were a way for the Israelites to express repentance, thanksgiving, and dedication to God (Leviticus 1-7).

In Christian theology, the Holy Place in the Old Testament is understood as a foreshadowing of the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence among his people through Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, believers are seen as the temple of God, and Christ himself becomes the true High Priest who offers the perfect sacrifice for all humanity (John 2:19-22; Ephesians 2:20-22; Hebrews 4:14-16).
