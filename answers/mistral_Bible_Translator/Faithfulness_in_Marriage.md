## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible teaches that faithfulness in marriage is a fundamental aspect of God's design for relationships between men and women. Regarding adultery, the Bible presents it as a grave sin. In Exodus 20:14, one of the Ten Commandments states, "You shall not commit adultery."

Adultery is seen as more than just an act of sexual immorality; it undermines the covenantal relationship between a man and a woman. In Matthew 5:27-28, Jesus expands on this idea when He says, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

The Bible also provides guidance for those who may find themselves in situations of infidelity. In the Old Testament book of Hosea, God uses the prophet Hosea to illustrate His love and forgiveness towards Israel, a nation that had been unfaithful to Him. Additionally, in 1 Corinthians 7:10-11, Paul writes, "To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife."

These passages show that while adultery is a serious sin, there is always hope for redemption and restoration when hearts are repentant and commit to faithfulness. The Bible teaches love, forgiveness, and the importance of maintaining the covenantal bond in marriage.
