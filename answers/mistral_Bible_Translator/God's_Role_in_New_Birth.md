## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christianity, the concept of being "born again" is rooted in John 3:3, where Jesus says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." This refers to spiritual rebirth, a transformation that occurs when an individual accepts Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord.

God's role in this process is crucial. It is through His grace and love that He initiates and facilitates the rebirth:

1. Drawing: John 6:44 says, "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him." God draws us to Himself by His irresistible grace.

2. Regeneration (New Birth): Ephesians 2:8-9 explains that we are saved by grace through faith, not by our own works. This new life in Christ is a gift from God and comes about when we put our faith in Him.

3. Conviction: John 16:8 tells us that the Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment. The Holy Spirit convicts us of our need for salvation, revealing to us our sinfulness and God's righteous standard.

4. Repentance and Faith: When we are convicted by the Holy Spirit, we repent (turn away) from our sins and put our faith in Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord. This is our response to God's initiative.

5. Sanctification: After being born again, God continues His work in us, sanctifying us—making us more like Jesus—through the power of the Holy Spirit. This process takes place throughout our lives.

6. Glorification: Upon completion of this earthly life, we will be with Christ, fully conformed to His image and enjoying eternal life in heaven.

So, in summary, God is the initiator and finisher of our spiritual rebirth. He draws us, regenerates us, convicts us, calls us to faith, sanctifies us, and promises to glorify us.
