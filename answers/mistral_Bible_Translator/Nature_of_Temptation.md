## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Christian theology as presented in the Bible, both our sinful nature (often referred to as the flesh) and external influences play significant roles in the process of temptation.

1. Our Sinful Nature: The Apostle Paul writes in Romans 7:23, "But I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members." This suggests that our innate sinful nature (often a result of Adam's original sin) can lead us to be drawn towards temptations. It is this inclination towards sin that Jesus refers to when He says, "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders" (Mark 7:21).

2. External Influences: The Bible also acknowledges that external influences can contribute significantly to temptation. James 1:14 says, "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire." Here, the role of external influences is not so much in directly causing the temptation, but rather in providing opportunities or triggers for our sinful nature to act upon. For example, Jesus warns against the deceitfulness of wealth (Matthew 13:22) and warns His disciples about the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, which represents their teachings that lead people astray (Matthew 16:6,12).

In conclusion, both our sinful nature and external influences play a role in the process of temptation. We are called to resist these temptations by renewing our minds according to God's Word (Romans 12:2) and relying on the power of the Holy Spirit within us (Galatians 5:16).
