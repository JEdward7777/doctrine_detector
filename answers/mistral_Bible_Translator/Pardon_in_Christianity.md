## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, the concept of pardon is closely tied to God's forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ. Pardon refers to the act of absolving or releasing someone from guilt, blame, or punishment. When we speak of God's forgiveness, it signifies His gracious and merciful act of letting go of the debt owed for our sins, and releasing us from their penalty, which is separation from Him.

Throughout the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the message of Jesus Christ emphasizes that God offers pardon for sin through His son's sacrifice on the cross. In John 3:16, it says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life." This verse encapsulates the essence of God's pardonâ€”that through believing in Jesus Christ, sinners can be reconciled with God, their sins being forgiven.

In addition to this, various passages in the New Testament emphasize that repentance and faith in Jesus Christ are essential for receiving God's pardon. Acts 20:21 states, "I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus." This passage shows the importance of turning away from sin (repentance) and putting one's faith in Christ for receiving pardon and forgiveness.

Ultimately, the concept of pardon, as it relates to God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ, underscores the love, grace, and mercy that God extends to sinners, making it possible for them to be restored to a right relationship with Him.
