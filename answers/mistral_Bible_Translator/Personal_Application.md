## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christianity, the concept of purification from sin is deeply rooted in the belief in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ and His sacrificial death on the cross. This process can be understood in several aspects:

1. **Justification**: This is the initial act by which God pardons sinners for their sin, declaring them righteous because of their faith in Jesus Christ. It is a judicial act whereby God imputes (credits) Christ's righteousness to the believer, and declares their sin as forgiven (Romans 3:24-25).

2. **Sanctification**: This is the ongoing process by which God makes us more like Jesus Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. As we yield to the Holy Spirit's leading, we grow in holiness and become less sinful (2 Corinthians 3:18, Philippians 2:12-13).

3. **Metanoia**: This Greek term means a radical change of mind, heart, and life that results in repentance from sin and faithful obedience to God. It involves turning away from sin and turning toward God (Acts 2:38, Acts 17:30).

4. **Purgation**: This term is more commonly associated with Catholic theology but has some relevance in Protestant theology as well. In a broader sense, it refers to the process of purifying the heart from earthly passions and desires so that one may better serve God (1 John 3:3).

In summary, for a Christian to experience purification from sin means undergoing a transformation where sin is removed, and righteousness is cultivated in our lives through faith in Jesus Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, and obedience to God's commands.
