## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Apostle Matthias was chosen by lot (casting of lots) to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, according to Acts 1:23-26. This event occurred after Jesus' ascension and before Pentecost in the early Christian church. However, it is important to note that only Matthias is recorded as being chosen this way, while the other disciple chosen by tradition, often referred to as "the Beloved Disciple" or John, was not among those who chose to be numbered with the twelve apostles.

## Grade
70.0

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 70

Comment: The response accurately identifies Matthias as the apostle chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, and correctly mentions the casting of lots as the method of selection. However, there is a missed opportunity to emphasize the significance of maintaining continuity in apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. Highlighting the importance of this continuity within the early Christian church from a Christian worldview perspective would have strengthened the response.
