## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, specifically in the Book of Acts chapter 2, Peter addresses the crowd who were responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus. He does not directly accuse them all individually, but rather speaks to the collective guilt of the Jewish people in this event.

Peter begins by quoting from the prophet Joel (Acts 2:16-21), explaining that these signs being fulfilled were what had been prophesied to occur before the coming of the Messiah and the pouring out of God's Spirit upon all people. Then, in Acts 2:36-38, Peter directly addresses their role in the crucifixion by saying:

"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah." (NIV)

Peter goes on to tell them that they were involved in the crucifixion but now have the opportunity for forgiveness through repentance and faith in Jesus. He asserts that there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. (Acts 4:12)

In this way, Peter addresses their role in the crucifixion, acknowledging their participation but also offering them a path towards forgiveness and eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ.
