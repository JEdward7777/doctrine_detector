## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a Christian context, the term 'Resurrection' refers to the miraculous event as described in the New Testament of the Bible, where Jesus Christ, after being crucified and buried, rose from the dead on the third day. This belief is central to Christianity and attests to Jesus' divinity, his victory over sin and death, and his promise of eternal life for those who believe in him.

In Christian theology, the Resurrection signifies that Jesus was indeed God Incarnate (God in human form) as he could not die permanently but had to be resurrected, demonstrating his power over death itself. The Resurrection is celebrated by Christians worldwide on Easter Sunday. It's important to note that the specifics of this event may vary slightly among different Christian denominations, yet the core belief remains consistent: Jesus Christ was crucified, died, and rose again three days later.
