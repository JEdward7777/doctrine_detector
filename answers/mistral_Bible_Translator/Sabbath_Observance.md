## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, keeping the Sabbath holy, as commanded to Moses in Exodus 20:8-11 and later expanded upon in Deuteronomy 5:12-15, means setting aside one day each week (Saturday, according to traditional Jewish observance) as a day of rest, worship, and reflection. This day is considered holy because it was the day God rested after creation (Genesis 2:2-3), and it's a reminder that Yahweh, the God of Israel, set apart the children of Israel from other nations.

The commandment states, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your livestock, nor the sojourner who is within your gates." (Exodus 20:8-10)

The intent behind this commandment is to honor God by taking a day off from work, spending time in prayer, worship, and study of God's word. It's also an opportunity for families and communities to come together, share meals, and strengthen relationships.
