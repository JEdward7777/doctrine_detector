## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1. Matthew 10:28 - "And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."

2. Matthew 12:36 - "But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment."

3. Matthew 25:46 - "Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."

4. John 12:48 - "He who rejects Me and does not receive My sayings, has one who judges him; the word I have spoken will judge him on the last day."

5. Acts 17:31 - "Because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead."

6. Romans 2:5-6 - "But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to each person according to his deeds:"

7. Revelation 20:11-15 - "Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged individually, according to their deeds. And death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."

These passages from the Bible support the concept of the day of judgment. They emphasize that everyone will be held accountable for their actions, and God will judge them accordingly on the last day.
