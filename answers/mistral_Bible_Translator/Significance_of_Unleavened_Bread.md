## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of the Old Testament, unleavened bread often symbolizes purity, sincerity, and quickness in obeying God's commands. This is particularly evident during the Passover celebration (Exodus 12:8) when Israelites were instructed to eat unleavened bread as they remembered God delivering them from Egyptian slavery. The use of unleavened bread serves as a reminder that sin, symbolized by leaven or yeast in Scripture (Matthew 16:11-12), should be removed from one's life to live a life pleasing to God.

Furthermore, the Passover story teaches us about redemption and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is the true Passover Lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7). By following in His footsteps and living a life that honors Him, Christians strive for spiritual purity and holiness (1 Peter 1:16) as they remember their own redemption from sin through faith in Christ.
