## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The phrase "El Shaddai" appears multiple times in the Old Testament, most notably in Genesis 17:1 and 28:3. It is a significant name of God in Hebrew and carries deep theological implications. The literal translation of "El Shaddai" is debated among scholars but generally accepted to mean "God Almighty."

Here's how this phrase has been translated into various languages based on local Bible translations:

1. English (King James Version): God Almighty
2. Spanish (Reina-Valera): Dios Todopoderoso
3. French (Louis Segond version): Dieu tout-puissant
4. German (Luther Bible): Gott allein Fürst und Mächtig
5. Italian (Diodati translation): Dio Potentissimo
6. Dutch (Statenvertaling): God Almachtig
7. Arabic (Peshitta): אל שדי, which is phonetically transliterated as "Allāh Qudūs" in modern Standard Arabic Bibles
8. Russian (Synodal Version of the Bible): Бог Вседержительный (Bog Vsesderzhitel'nyy)
9. Chinese (Chinese Union Version): 神之强者, which translates as "Shén zhī Liángzé"
10. Japanese (Tanaka Version): 全能の神, which translates as "Zennō no kami"

It's essential to note that translation is not always straightforward and can vary depending on cultural nuances, the target audience of the Bible translation, and the specific translation method used by the translators. The primary goal remains to accurately convey the meaning and theology intended in the original Hebrew text while also maintaining readability for contemporary audiences in their respective languages.
