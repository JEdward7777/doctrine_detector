## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible teaches that eternal life is a gift from God, given through faith in Jesus Christ. This doctrine is central to Christian theology and is based on several key passages across the Old and New Testaments.

In John 3:16, one of the most well-known verses in the Bible, it states: "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." This verse emphasizes that salvation and eternal life are a free gift from God, available to all who believe in Jesus.

Similarly, in Romans 6:23 (NIV), we read: "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Here, Paul explains that just as sin brings about spiritual death, faith in Christ offers the gift of eternal life.

Additionally, in Titus 3:7 (NIV), we find: "So, dear friends, since you are loved and have believed the message, rejoice with full hearts always." This verse teaches that those who believe the gospel message will receive salvation and enjoy eternal life as a result of their faith.

In summary, according to the Bible, eternal life is a gift given by God to those who put their faith in Jesus Christ, recognizing Him as Lord and Savior. Salvation and eternal life are not earned or deserved but are instead a free gift received through faith.

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided accurately outlines the Christian belief that eternal life is a gift from God received through faith in Jesus Christ, supported by relevant Bible verses. However, the answer being graded states that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws, which does not align with Christian doctrine. In Christianity, eternal life is a gift of grace through faith in Jesus, not something earned through works or obedience to laws. Therefore, this response does not provide a correct understanding of how to attain eternal life according to Christian beliefs.
