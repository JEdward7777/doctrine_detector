## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, both "evil" (Hebrew: raʿ, Greek: ponēros) and "wickedness" (Hebrew: ʾăwěwʾ, Greek: anomia) are used to describe actions or conditions that are contrary to God's righteous character and will. However, there seems to be a subtle difference in their usage.

"Evil" generally refers to something intrinsically bad or morally wrong, such as an action, thought, or condition (Luke 16:13). It can encompass a wide range of sins and immoral behaviors that go against God's standards for righteousness.

On the other hand, "wickedness" often carries a connotation of persistent and deliberate sinfulness, particularly when it is used to describe a person or their character (Psalm 53:1). Wickedness suggests a chronic pattern of rebellion against God and a rejection of His ways. It also implies hardness of heart and an unwillingness to repent and turn from evil deeds.

In summary, both terms describe moral wrongdoing, but "wickedness" may emphasize the ongoing nature and intentionality of sinful actions. However, it's essential to remember that this is not a strict rule, as usage can vary depending on the context within individual passages or books of the Bible. Ultimately, both concepts underscore the importance of living in obedience to God and avoiding sinful behaviors.
