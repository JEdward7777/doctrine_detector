## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In biblical times, myrrh was indeed a significant component in burial practices, as we can see from the accounts of the Old and New Testaments. Myrrh was a resin obtained from several species of small, thorny trees native to Africa and Asia. It was used for various purposes, including embalming, anointing, perfumes, and incense.

In the Old Testament, we find references to myrrh in connection with anointing oil, which was often used in religious ceremonies and the consecration of priests (Exodus 30:23). However, its most notable usage comes in the context of burial practices. For instance, when Joseph died, his sons embalmed him and "the Egyptians wept for him seventy days" (Genesis 50:3). They used myrrh and other spices in the process of embalming Joseph (Genesis 50:11).

In the New Testament, we find the three wise men bringing gifts to baby Jesus, one of which was myrrh (Matthew 2:11). While it is not explicitly stated that myrrh was used in Jesus' burial (John 19:40 states they did not use it because they had a mixture of aloes and myrrh ready for his body), its association with death and embalming may have been symbolic.

The burial practice involving myrrh served both practical and spiritual purposes, symbolizing the bitterness and pain associated with death, as well as offering a fragrant aroma representing hope and purity in the presence of God (Psalm 45:8).

Comment: The response provides a detailed explanation of how myrrh was used in biblical times, particularly in burial practices, highlighting its significance in anointing and respect for the deceased.

The explanation aligns well with the concern raised regarding the importance of understanding cultural customs in Scripture. The only improvement could be to further emphasize the spiritual symbolism of myrrh in addition to its practical applications.
