## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, in the context of Islamic and Christian interpretations of the Old Testament, several passages are often referenced when discussing the concept of the "Son of Man" as the Messiah. Here are a few:

1. Daniel 7:13-14: In this passage, the "Son of Man" is presented as a divine figure who will receive dominion and everlasting kingship from God. This is one of the key passages where the term "Son of Man" is used, and it's interpreted differently in both Islamic and Christian traditions.

2. Daniel 9:25-26: This passage predicts that after 70 weeks (490 years), the Messiah will be cut off but will confirm a covenant with many for one week (seven years). In Christian tradition, this is often interpreted as referring to Jesus Christ.

3. Isaiah 53:2-12: This passage describes a suffering servant who bears the sins of many and makes intercession for them. While Muslims believe that this passage refers to Prophet Muhammad or other prophets, Christians interpret it as a prophecy about Jesus Christ.

4. Psalm 2:7-8: In this passage, God is said to have declared the Messiah as his beloved Son and given him dominion over the nations. This is another passage where the concept of the Messiah as a divine figure is emphasized.

Comment: The response effectively references key passages such as Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel to illustrate the connection between the title 'Son of Man' and Jesus' messianic role. It delves into how the Old Testament influences the New Testament's understanding, particularly in portraying Jesus as the fulfillment of prophecies related to the 'Son of Man.' The answer could be strengthened by further emphasizing the significance of these Old Testament passages in shaping the Christian worldview of Jesus as the Messiah.
