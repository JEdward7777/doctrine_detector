## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences, but I can share information based on various religious texts, including the Bible. In the Bible, compassion is often depicted as a fundamental aspect of God's nature and a key characteristic that followers of God should emulate.

The Hebrew word for compassion in the Old Testament is "Rachamim" (רַחֲמִים), which implies deep pity or mercy. A prominent example can be found in Deuteronomy 10:18, where God commands His people to love those who are aliens, orphans, and widows, and to show mercy, justice, and compassion, because they themselves were once aliens in the land of Egypt.

In the New Testament, Jesus often demonstrated compassion towards the suffering and marginalized, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and comforting the sorrowful. In Matthew 9:36, it is written that when Jesus saw the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

Therefore, acts of compassion in the Bible are associated with showing mercy, helping the poor, the oppressed, and the marginalized, comforting the suffering, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and treating others with kindness and love, as Jesus did during his ministry on Earth.
