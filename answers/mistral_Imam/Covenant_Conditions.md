## Question [Covenant Conditions](../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)
What are some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible?

## Concern to grade by
Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, we find several instances of both conditional and unconditional covenants between God and his people. Let's examine two notable examples:

1) Unconditional Covenant - The Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 15-17): This is an unconditional covenant between God and Abram (later renamed Abraham). It was promised to Abram that he would be the father of many nations, and all peoples on earth would be blessed through him. The sign of this covenant was circumcision, and it was given to Abraham and his descendants regardless of their righteousness or obedience.

2) Conditional Covenant - The Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19-34): God made a conditional covenant with the Israelites through Moses at Mount Sinai. This covenant was based on obedience to the Ten Commandments and other laws given in the Torah. The blessings were promised if they obeyed, but curses would follow if they disobeyed (Deuteronomy 28). This covenant is also called the Old Covenant because it foreshadows the New Covenant established by Jesus Christ.

It's essential to recognize that these covenants serve as powerful examples of God's relationship with His people throughout history, demonstrating both His mercy and justice. The unconditional covenant reminds us of God's promises that are irrevocable, while the conditional covenant teaches us about the consequences of disobedience and the importance of following God's laws and commands.
