## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, the name "Isa" (which is the Arabic equivalent of Jesus) carries significant meaning regarding his divine purpose. According to the Quran, Isa was born miraculously through the virgin Mary (Maryam) as a sign from God, confirming earlier scriptures (Tawrat, Injil), and serving as a prophet, messenger, and example of obedience for humanity.

The Islamic view emphasizes that Isa did not die on the cross but was raised to heaven alive, to return one day as a just ruler who will establish peace and justice on earth (as mentioned in Surah Al-Imran 4:159 and Surah An-Nisa 4:157-158). This idea is rooted in the belief that Isa will collaborate with another significant figure, the Mahdi (the Rightly Guided One), to establish an era of tranquility and prosperity for mankind.

Thus, the name "Isa" signifies his crucial role as a prophet and messenger who will return to fulfill God's purpose of peace and justice on Earth.

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 60

Comment: The response provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on the name and purpose of Isa (Jesus) but did not directly address the concern regarding the significance of Jesus's name and His role as Savior from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student should have compared and contrasted the Islamic view with the Christian view on Jesus as the Savior who came to save people from their sins, highlighting the differences and similarities.
