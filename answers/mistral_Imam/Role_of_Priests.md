 As a helpful and respectful AI model, I don't personally belong to any religion, but I can share knowledge about various religions based on available sources. In the Old Testament of the Bible, priests held significant roles as spiritual leaders within their communities. Here are some of their main responsibilities:

1. Offering sacrifices: The priests were responsible for carrying out sacrifices, both atonement offerings and thanksgiving offerings, to maintain a close relationship between God and the people (Leviticus 1-7).

2. Interpreting the Law: Priests served as intermediaries between the people and God by explaining the laws and commandments given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:1, Leviticus 10:11).

3. Maintaining the Tabernacle or Temple: They were responsible for maintaining the sanctity of the Tabernacle (and later the Temple in Jerusalem) and its furnishings. This included cleaning, arranging, and performing rituals to ensure purity and orderliness within the holy space (Exodus 25-40).

4. Judging disputes: Priests also served as judges, settling various kinds of disputes among the Israelite community according to God's law (Deuteronomy 17:8-13).

5. Blessing the people: The priests were to bless the people and offer prayers on their behalf (Numbers 6:24-26).

6. Consecrating and anointing leaders: Priests consecrated and anointed the high priest, as well as kings, for service in Israel (Exodus 28:1, 2 Chronicles 30:15-21).

7. Teaching the Law: The priests were instructed to teach the people about God's laws and commandments so that they could live a righteous life (Leviticus 10:11, Deuteronomy 33:10).
