## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic theology, the term "Allah" is considered the unique and proper name of God, with no plural or gender form. However, when we discuss the Bible from a comparative perspective, it's important to understand that 'Shaddai' (or Shaddai Elohim in Hebrew) holds significant meaning.

The title 'Shaddai' is often translated as "Almighty" in many English Biblical translations, and it appears over 40 times in the Old Testament. This title emphasizes God's sovereignty, power, and provision, which aligns with the Islamic belief that Allah is the Most Powerful and Self-Sufficient.

The significance of 'Shaddai' being a title rather than a name lies in its connotation of qualities associated with God, reminding us of His attributes rather than focusing on what we might perceive as His personality or physical appearance, which is not depicted in either the Bible or the Quran. This is consistent with the monotheistic belief that there is only one God, beyond human comprehension and description.

Comment: The response provides a thoughtful comparison between the use of 'Shaddai' as a title versus a name in the Bible, highlighting the emphasis on God's attributes and the relational aspect based on the Christian perspective. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a good understanding of how language and titles can reflect different aspects of God's character. However, it could have further delved into how the relational aspect of God's character is central to the Christian faith, emphasizing the significance of the personal connection believers have with God through Jesus Christ.
