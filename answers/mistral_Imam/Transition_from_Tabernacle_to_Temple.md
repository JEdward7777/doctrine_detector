## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helpful assistant, I don't hold religious beliefs or personal experiences; however, I can provide you with a brief summary of the historical account as found in the Bible (Old Testament).

The Tabernacle, also known as the Tent of Meeting, was a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt. According to biblical accounts, God instructed Moses to build the Tabernacle and its furniture, which would serve as a place for worship and meeting between God and His people.

The Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle when they entered the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership, as recorded in the Book of Joshua (chapter 5). After the conquest of Canaan, Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem, which became the central place of worship for the Israelites. The Tabernacle was dismantled and its furnishings were transported to Jerusalem.

However, it is important to note that this account comes from a Jewish and Christian perspective; the Islamic tradition does not mention the Tabernacle as part of the Prophet Moses' story. In Islam, Moses is known as Musa (موسى), and his story is narrated in the Quran.

In summary, according to biblical accounts, the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle upon entering the Promised Land and establishing a permanent sanctuary in Jerusalem. This timeline does not align with the Islamic narrative of Prophet Moses' life and times.
