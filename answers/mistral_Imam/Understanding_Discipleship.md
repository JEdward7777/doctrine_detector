## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, as a Muslim Imam, I should clarify that Muslims do not view themselves as disciples of Jesus in the same way Christians do. Islam respects and reveres Jesus (peace be upon him) as one of the greatest prophets of God, sent with a specific message to the Children of Israel.

According to Islamic teachings, being a disciple of Jesus for Muslims means acknowledging his prophethood, believing in his miracles, and following his moral teachings as outlined in the Quran and authentic hadiths. However, Muslims do not believe that Jesus died on the cross or was divinely crucifixion-substituted by another person (a doctrine known as Crucifixion Denial). Instead, we believe he was raised to heaven alive.

Therefore, being a disciple of Jesus for Muslims is about understanding and emulating his virtues such as love, mercy, and humility, and accepting the message he brought, which is a call to worship One God and submit to His will. This alignment with Jesus' teachings forms an essential part of Islamic faith and practice.
