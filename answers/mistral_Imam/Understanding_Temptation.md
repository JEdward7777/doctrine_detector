## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, it is important to approach this question with respect for all prophets, including Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him), and his life story as recorded in the Quran and authentic Hadith. However, it is also crucial to understand that the Islamic perspective may differ slightly from the New Testament accounts, particularly regarding certain details and interpretations of events.

In the Quran, we find an account of Prophet Jesus' encounter with Satan (Iblis) in Surah Al-Israa (17:61-65). In this passage, Jesus is tested three times while he is still a baby in the cradle. The first two temptations involve turning stones into bread and jumping from the high place to prove his power; both are rejected by Jesus. The third temptation, which comes after his temptation in the wilderness as an adult, involves worshipping Satan instead of Allah (swt) in exchange for ruling all of humanity. Again, Jesus resists this temptation and declares: "Verily, I have been a servant of Allah since my pre-existence."

Here are some strategies that can be gleaned from Prophet Jesus' response to Satan's temptations:

1. Faithful Submission (Iman): Jesus firmly believed in the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed) and never wavered from this fundamental belief, even when confronted with seemingly enticing offers.

2. Patience (Sabr): Prophet Jesus demonstrated immense patience throughout his life, particularly during times of hardship and testing. He was steadfast in his faith despite facing trials and persecutions.

3. Relying on Allah: By acknowledging that he was a servant of Allah since his pre-existence, Jesus showed trust and reliance upon God throughout his life. This unwavering commitment to Allah helped him resist temptations and fulfill his mission.

4. Understanding the nature of worldly temptations: Prophet Jesus understood that worldly pleasures and power were temporary, while obedience to Allah and faithfulness to His commands would yield eternal rewards.

5. Recognizing the true source of power: Instead of seeking temporary power through Satan's offers, Prophet Jesus knew that true power came from God alone. By remaining steadfast in his servitude to Allah, he was able to resist temptations effectively.
