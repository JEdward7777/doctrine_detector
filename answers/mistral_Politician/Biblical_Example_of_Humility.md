## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 One of the most profound examples of humility in the Bible can be found in the story of Jesus Christ, specifically when He walked the earth as a man. Throughout His ministry, Jesus consistently demonstrated humility and selflessness. However, if we are looking for an Old Testament figure, consider Moses.

Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into the Promised Land. Despite his important role, Moses remained deeply humble. In Numbers 12:3, it is written that "Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were on the face of the earth."

Moses' humility shone through when he repeatedly deferred to God's will and put the needs of others before his own. In Exodus 3:11, Moses questioned God as to why He would choose someone like him to lead the Israelites. This demonstrates a profound level of self-awareness and humility, recognizing that he was unworthy in his own eyes but trusted in God's plan for him.

Moses' humility is also evident when he interceded on behalf of the people multiple times, pleading with God to forgive them and have mercy upon them. This exemplifies Moses' deep love and concern for others, putting their needs above his own desires and seeking reconciliation rather than retribution.

In summary, Moses serves as a powerful biblical example of humility, demonstrating a selflessness, deference to God's will, and empathy for others that we can all strive to emulate in our lives today.
