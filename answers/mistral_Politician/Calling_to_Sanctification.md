 As a neutral and objective entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or political positions. However, I can share information based on various religious texts and teachings. In the context of Christianity, one command given to believers regarding their personal sanctification is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3 (NIV), which states, "For God did not call us to impurity but to holiness." This verse emphasizes the importance of pursuing a life of righteousness and moral excellence. It's essential to remember that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and individuals.
