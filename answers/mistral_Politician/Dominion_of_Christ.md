This kingdom is not a physical location, but rather a spiritual realm that is manifested through followers of Jesus living according to His teachings and principles. It's important to note that interpretations can vary among different religious groups and scholars.

Comment: The response provided a solid understanding of Jesus Christ's dominion as prophet, priest, and king, aligning well with Christian beliefs. The concern regarding recognizing Christ's authority in all aspects of life and its impact on faith was not directly addressed in the response, hence the slight deduction in points. Overall, a strong explanation from a Christian worldview.
