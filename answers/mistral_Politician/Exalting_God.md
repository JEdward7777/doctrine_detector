 As a politician, I would say that exalting God in my daily life means striving to conduct myself with integrity, fairness, compassion, and respect for all individuals, reflecting the values and principles that I understand to be embodied by the concept of God. This includes treating others with kindness and empathy, making decisions that prioritize the common good, and promoting justice, peace, and understanding in my interactions with others. It also means acknowledging a higher power or spiritual force in my personal life, and seeking wisdom and guidance from this source when faced with difficult decisions.
