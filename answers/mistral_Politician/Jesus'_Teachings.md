 As a responsible and sensitive communicator, it would be crucial for me to approach religious or historical figures like Jesus with utmost respect. In the context of your question, Jesus often used "Amen" at the end of his teachings to underscore their truthfulness and authenticity. It serves as an affirmation, expressing solemn agreement or assent. Using "Amen" in this manner was a common practice in Jewish tradition during Jesus' time. By employing such terms, Jesus aimed to emphasize the importance and reliability of His teachings, ensuring they resonated with His audience.
