## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 According to the Bible, God instructed the Israelites that on the seventh day, which was the Sabbath, no manna should be gathered (Exodus 16:23-26). Instead, they were supposed to prepare what they needed for that day on the sixth day and rest on the seventh. This rule was given to ensure that everyone would have enough food for six days, but on the Sabbath, they would take a double portion on the day before to avoid working on the Sabbath.

## Grade

## Comment given with grade
Grade: 95

Comment: The response accurately summarizes the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands by highlighting the specific instruction given to the Israelites regarding gathering manna. The reference to Exodus 16:23-26 further solidifies the connection to God's commandment. The only minor improvement would be to elaborate more on the spiritual significance and broader context of Sabbath observance in the Christian faith.
