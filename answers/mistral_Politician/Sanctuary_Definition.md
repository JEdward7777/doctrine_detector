## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the broader context of the Bible, the term "sanctuary" generally refers to a sacred or holy place set apart for religious worship, particularly the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem. However, it's important to note that this is a common interpretation and meanings can vary depending on specific denominations or interpretations.

In more modern contexts, "sanctuary" may be used metaphorically to refer to a safe place or refuge for people fleeing danger, which has been adopted in discussions surrounding immigration policy where "sanctuary cities" are those offering protection to undocumented immigrants facing potential deportation. As a politically correct individual, it's crucial to acknowledge and respect the multiple connotations of this term across cultures, religions, and political discourses.
