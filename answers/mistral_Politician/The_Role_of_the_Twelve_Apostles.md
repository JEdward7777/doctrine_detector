## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician aiming to be inclusive, I would like to highlight that Jesus had numerous followers during his time, but it was the Twelve Apostles who held a special place in his ministry and teaching. This group of twelve disciples were chosen by Jesus for their unique roles in spreading his message and establishing the Christian faith after his death and resurrection.

Each apostle represented a distinctive aspect of the community that formed around Jesus, ensuring diversity within this inner circle. Their significance lies not only in being closely associated with Jesus but also in their vital contributions to early Christianity by acting as witnesses to Jesus' teachings, miracles, and ultimately his crucifixion and resurrection.

It is essential to acknowledge the importance of the Twelve Apostles in Christian tradition without focusing on the specific beliefs or practices that may be controversial or divisive among different groups. Instead, let us appreciate their historical significance and the impact they had on shaping one of the world's major religions, fostering unity and understanding among people from all walks of life.
