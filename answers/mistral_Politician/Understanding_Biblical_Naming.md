 In the context of Biblical naming, when it says "His name is called John," it signifies the formal or official name given to an individual. The name "John" was bestowed upon several important figures in the Bible, such as John the Baptist and John the Apostle, to identify them distinctly. This convention is consistent throughout the Bible, where names often serve as a way to denote the identity of characters within the narrative. It's essential to note that understanding the Biblical context provides insight into the significance behind these names, including the meaning, origin, and any associated symbolism or prophecy.
