 As a neutral entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations, but I can share with you what various Christian denominations interpret from the Bible regarding inheriting eternal life.

In most Christian traditions, they believe that eternal life is a gift of salvation and a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. This belief is based on passages such as John 3:16 (King James Version): "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

Inheriting eternal life is often seen as a journey of faith and obedience to Jesus' teachings. It's important to note that interpretations can vary widely among different denominations and individual Christians.

To provide some more context:
- Romans 6:23 (KJV) states, "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
- John 14:6 (KJV) says, "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
- Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) reads, "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."
