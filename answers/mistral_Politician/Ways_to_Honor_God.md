2. Read and study Scripture: Reading and studying the Bible helps Christians deepen their understanding of God's teachings, principles, and values, which can be applied in daily life.

3. Practice love and compassion: Following Jesus' example, Christians are called to love others as themselves (Matthew 22:39). This includes showing kindness, empathy, and patience towards all people, regardless of their background or circumstances.
