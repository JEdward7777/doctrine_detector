## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian theology, the Bible does not specify a singular "Archangel" but rather refers to two angels as archangels: Michael and Gabriel. The term "archangel" means chief angel or leader of angels.

In Daniel 10:13, an unnamed "archangel" appears before the prophet Daniel to interpret his visions, but this is not explicitly identified as either Michael or Gabriel. In the New Testament, however, the Archangel Michael is mentioned by name in Jude 9 and Revelation 12:7-9, where he contends with the devil over the body of Moses and leads the army of angels against Satan and his fallen angels during the war in heaven.

Archangel Gabriel is most well known for appearing to Zechariah (the father of John the Baptist) and Mary (the mother of Jesus) in the New Testament, delivering crucial messages from God about their respective roles in salvation history (Luke 1:19, 26-38).

It's important to note that interpretations and beliefs can vary among different Christian denominations and traditions.
