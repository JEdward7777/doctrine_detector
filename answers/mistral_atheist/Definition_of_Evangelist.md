## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The term "Evangelist" originates from the Greek language, specifically within the New Testament of the Christian Bible. More precisely, it comes from the noun εὐαγγέλιον (euangélion), which means "good news," and from the verb form εὐαγγέλισα (euangelisas) or εὐαγγέλιστος (euangelistós), meaning "to announce good news" or "herald."

In Christian theology, an Evangelist is one who writes a Gospel account of Jesus' life and teachings. The four canonical New Testament Gospels — Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John — are traditionally attributed to these four evangelists. This usage of the term refers to the specific role as the authors of the sacred texts, rather than a more general sense of spreading the Christian faith as a missionary or preacher.

It is important to note that cultural connotations can vary significantly for words like "evangelist," as they have been used in different contexts throughout history and may still carry various meanings within different religious, political, and societal frameworks.
