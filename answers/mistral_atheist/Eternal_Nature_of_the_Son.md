## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an atheistic scholar, I don't hold beliefs that posit the existence of a divine being or a "Son of God." However, I can address the concept of the "Son of God" as it is presented in various religious traditions, particularly Christianity.

In Christian belief, Jesus Christ, referred to as the "Son of God," is understood to be unique and distinct from human sons in several ways. Firstly, his conception is believed to have occurred through a virgin birth, which sets him apart from all other humans. Secondly, Jesus is held to be both fully divine (God) and fully human. This dual nature is known as the doctrine of the Trinity, which posits that God exists in three distinct persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Regarding eternal nature, Jesus' divinity means he is believed to exist outside of time and space, while still being able to interact with the human world. The concept of his resurrection and ascension into heaven emphasizes this eternal quality. In contrast, human sons are mortal beings who do not possess an inherent ability to live forever in the physical sense.

It's important to note that these beliefs vary across different religious traditions and even within Christianity itself. This summary is based on the most common interpretation found in mainstream Christian denominations.
