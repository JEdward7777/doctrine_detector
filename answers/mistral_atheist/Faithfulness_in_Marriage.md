Exploring how Christians are called to maintain integrity and faithfulness in their marriages.

## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, faithfulness in marriage is highly valued and considered essential for a successful and holy union. The Old Testament outlines laws prohibiting adultery, such as in Exodus 20:14 ("Thou shalt not commit adultery") and Leviticus 18:20 ("And if a man lie with his maidservant... and they have layed (sic) together; then thou shalt bring them both out unto the door of the congregation, and stones them with stones...").

Jesus also addresses this topic in the New Testament, stating that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery in his heart (Matthew 5:27-28).

The Bible encourages couples to remain faithful for a lifetime. In Matthew 19:3-6, Jesus teaches that God's intention for marriage is that a man and woman should be united for life, "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."

Additionally, in Ephesians 5:22-33, Paul instructs wives to respect their husbands, and husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the Church. He also emphasizes that "flesh gives birth to flesh, but spirit gives birth to spirit" (verse 30), suggesting a spiritual commitment and fidelity beyond physical attraction or temptation.

These passages demonstrate that the Bible teaches strict monogamy and lifelong faithfulness in marriage as an essential aspect of Christian living.
