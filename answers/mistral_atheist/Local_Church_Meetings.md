## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In early Christian history, as documented in the New Testament and early Church writings, believers typically met in each other's homes for fellowship, prayer, teaching, and communion. This practice was known as a "house church" or a "domus ecclesia" in Latin.

The Book of Acts (chapter 2) describes the first Christian community meeting together daily in the temple courts for teaching and fellowship, while also breaking bread in their homes. The Apostle Paul also established house churches during his missionary journeys, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles and his epistles.

According to church tradition, the earliest Christian communities were organized in this way until the construction of purpose-built basilicas for worship around the 4th century AD. This communal gathering in homes was a key feature of early Christianity that reflected its emphasis on fellowship, mutual support, and community.
