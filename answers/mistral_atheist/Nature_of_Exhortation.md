 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or affiliations; however, I can certainly help explain how Christians might approach exhoration based on the teachings in the New Testament. Here are some key points:

1. Love and Grace: The foundation for any Christian exhortation is love (1 Corinthians 13) and grace (Ephesians 2:8-9). This means that the motivation behind exhorting others should be rooted in a deep love for them, as well as recognizing that they are saved by God's grace.

2. Humility: Christians should approach others with humility, acknowledging their own shortcomings and not judging others (Matthew 7:1-5). This doesn't mean they shouldn't share the truth, but it does mean they should do so in a loving, gentle, and respectful manner.

3. Truth and Grace: Balancing truth and grace is crucial when exhorting others. While the message must be grounded in biblical truth (2 Timothy 4:2), it should also be delivered with grace, acknowledging that the listener may struggle to understand or accept the message (Galatians 6:1).

4. Encouragement and Consolation: Alongside exhortation, Christians are called to encourage one another (1 Thessalonians 5:11) and console those who are in distress (2 Corinthians 1:3-4). This means that while they may need to challenge others, they should also provide comfort and support.

5. Patience and Perseverance: Exhortation is often a long-term process, requiring patience and perseverance (Galatians 6:9). Christians should expect resistance and be prepared to continue exhorting others over time.

6. Prayer: Ultimately, any exhortation should be accompanied by prayer. Christians are called to pray for one another (James 5:16), asking God to work in the hearts of those they are exhorting.

In summary, Christian exhortation should be characterized by love, humility, truth, grace, encouragement, consolation, patience, perseverance, and prayer. This approach aims to build up others in their faith while maintaining a spirit of gentleness and respect.
