## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian theology, the concept of repentance plays a significant role in understanding the relationship between individuals and the Wrath of God as depicted in the Bible. Repentance involves a sincere regret for past sins, a turning away from them, and a commitment to change one's behavior.

The Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) provides numerous examples of God calling his people to repentance when they have strayed from His laws. For instance, in Jonah 3:10, after the city of Nineveh heard Jonah's message and repented, God relents on the punishment he had threatened them with: "When God saw what they did (and how they stopped their evil ways), He changed His mind and did not carry out the destruction He had threatened."

In the New Testament, Jesus frequently called for repentance. In Matthew 4:17, it is written, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Similarly, in Acts 2:38, Peter tells the crowd on Pentecost, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."

Regarding the Wrath of God, Paul writes in Romans 1:18, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness." However, he also emphasizes that God's wrath can be appeased through repentance. In verses 24-25 of the same chapter, Paul writes, "Therefore God gave them up in the desires of their hearts to sexual impurity, to the degrading practices of their bodies... They exchanged the truth about God for lies and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator." Yet, he also says, "For God did not hold back His wrath forever, but His love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who He has given us."

In summary, the Bible portrays repentance as a way for individuals to turn away from sin and reconcile with God, preventing His wrath from being poured out on them. However, it's important to note that interpretations of these passages can vary greatly among different Christian denominations and scholars.
