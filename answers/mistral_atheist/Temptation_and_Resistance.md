## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Christian narrative, the account of Jesus' response to the temptations by Satan can be found in the Gospel of Matthew (4:1-11), and it also appears in the Gospels of Mark (1:12-13) and Luke (4:1-13).

According to this narrative, after Jesus was baptized, He was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. During this time, Satan presented Jesus with three major tests or temptations.

1. The first temptation involved turning stones into bread, but Jesus replied that man shall not live on bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.
2. The second temptation was for Jesus to jump off a high place and let angels save Him, but He responded that it is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'
3. The third temptation was for Jesus to bow down and worship Satan in exchange for all the kingdoms of the world, but Jesus said that it is written: "Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only."

Jesus' responses to these temptations emphasize His faithfulness to God and the importance of God's word. Instead of succumbing to Satan's manipulations, Jesus demonstrates self-control, reliance on divine guidance, and unwavering commitment to God's will. This account is significant in Christian teachings, as it sets a model for how believers should resist temptation and remain steadfast in their faith.
