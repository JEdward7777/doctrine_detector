## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, the concept of 'fear' often carries a deeper and more complex meaning than its everyday usage in our daily lives. Fear in biblical context can be divided into two main types: fear of God and fear of man (or earthly fear).

1. Fear of God: This is not so much about being scared of God's wrath or retribution but rather an attitude of awe, reverence, and respect for the divine. It refers to understanding the majesty, power, and holiness of God, which leads one to live in accordance with His will. In Proverbs 9:10, it states that "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom," implying a deep understanding and reverence for God that informs one's life choices.

2. Fear of man (or earthly fear): This type of fear involves being overly concerned with human opinions, social norms, and the expectations of others. It can lead to compromise of one's values and principles in an attempt to avoid disapproval or rejection. The Bible often advises against this kind of fear, encouraging believers to trust God instead (Proverbs 29:25).

In contrast, everyday fear commonly refers to feelings of anxiety, apprehension, or worry about specific situations or events in our personal lives. It is not always tied to reverence for a higher power and may not necessarily guide one's actions towards wisdom or away from compromise.
