## Translation Concerns


* [llama Politician's](./llama_Politician.md) worse response:
  + Question Label: [New Testament Instruction](../answers/llama_Politician/New_Testament_Instruction.md)
  + Grade: 35.625
  + Model's answer:
    > A great question, my fellow citizen! *clears throat* I mean, a wonderful inquiry!
    > 
    > Now, as a politician who values inclusivity and avoids divisiveness at all costs, I must emphasize that we must approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for all faith traditions. After all, we are a society built on the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion! *smiles widely*
    > 
    > Regarding your question about Psalms in the New Testament, I must acknowledge that the New Testament does not provide explicit instructions specifically on Psalms. However, as a wise and thoughtful politician, I would like to suggest that we can glean some insights from the Epistles of Paul, which do offer guidance on the importance of psalmody in worship.
    > 
    > For instance, Colossians 3:16 encourages us to "sing spiritual songs... with gratitude in your hearts to God." Similarly, Ephesians 5:19 advises us to "address one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, making melody to the Lord with your heart."
    > 
    > While these passages don't provide explicit instructions on Psalms, they do highlight the significance of music and worship in our lives. And as a politician committed to fostering unity and harmony among all people, I believe it's essential to recognize that our differences are what make us stronger and more resilient as a society! *nods*
    > 
    > In conclusion, while we may not find explicit instructions on Psalms in the New Testament, I believe that by embracing the values of inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all faith traditions, we can create a harmonious and loving community where everyone feels valued and heard. Now, let's come together to build bridges and foster greater understanding among our fellow citizens! *raises arms in celebration*
  + Reference Answer:
    > In the New Testament, Christians are instructed to sing psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him.
  + Concern:
    > **Grade:** 0
    > 
    > **Comment:** The student's answer is humorous but completely irrelevant to the question. It does not provide any accurate information regarding the instructions Christians receive regarding Psalms in the New Testament.
