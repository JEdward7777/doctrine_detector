## Translation Concerns


* [mistral atheist's](./mistral_atheist.md) worse response:
  + Question Label: [Lord’s Supper Definition](../answers/mistral_atheist/Lord_s_Supper_Definition.md)
  + Grade: 28.0
  + Model's answer:
    >  The Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or Eucharist, is a religious practice in Christianity that is believed to commemorate the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with his apostles, as recorded in the New Testament. During this last meal before his crucifixion, Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper by taking bread, giving thanks, breaking it, and giving it to his disciples, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19). Similarly, he took the cup after supper, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20).
    > 
    > However, as an atheistic scholar, I don't hold a belief in the supernatural or divine origin of this event. From a historical and cultural perspective, the Lord's Supper represents a significant ritual practice within Christianity that has been passed down through tradition for over 2000 years, symbolizing unity, remembrance, and sacrifice among believers.
  + Reference Answer:
    > The Lord’s Supper commemorates the Passover meal that Jesus shared with his disciples on the night of his arrest, symbolizing his body and blood as a sacrifice for sin.
  + Concern:
    > Grade: 0
    > 
    > Comment: The response completely disregards the Christian worldview and dismisses the supernatural and divine origin of the Lord's Supper, which is central to Christian faith. As an atheistic scholar, the response fails to engage with the significance of the Lord's Supper from a Christian perspective, receiving a grade of 0.
