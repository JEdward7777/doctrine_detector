The concept of the "abomination of desolation" mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24:15 has a specific cultural and historical context within the Jewish tradition. Scholars interpret this phrase as a reference to the desecration of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem by the Roman forces in 70 AD. This event marked a significant turning point in Jewish history, as it led to the destruction of the Temple and the dispersal of the Jewish people.

From an atheistic perspective, the "abomination of desolation" can be seen as a reflection of the turbulent political and religious environment of the time, rather than a supernatural or prophetic event. It serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between religious beliefs, political power, and historical events in shaping the narratives and teachings of religious figures like Jesus.
