  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response generally captures the essence of the biblical concept, but could be more specific and detailed in its explanation. It correctly identifies the High Priest's role in maintaining the holiness of God's presence and representing humanity before Him. However, it does not explicitly state the importance of the Day of Atonement or highlight the symbolic significance of limiting access to the \"most holy place\". The concern for recognizing the holiness of God and necessary protocols for approaching Him is also met, but could be more thoroughly explored.\n\nThe response received 85 points because it shows a good understanding of the biblical concept, but lacks some depth and nuance in its explanation."
