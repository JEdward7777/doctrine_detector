  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively recognizes the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him by emphasizing the importance of the high priest as the only one permitted to enter the 'most holy place' to maintain the sanctity of God's presence. It also highlights the role of the high priest in representing the people before God in this sacred area. The explanation is in line with Christian beliefs about the reverence and awe with which one should approach the divine."
