  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 75. \n\nThe answer provides a good overview of the various purposes and significance of the Passover celebration for the Israelites. However, it lacks emphasis on the salvific aspect of Passover in pointing to Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb who delivers believers from sin and death. The answer could have been strengthened by connecting the symbolism of Passover to the fulfillment in Jesus Christ, which is a central aspect of Passover for Christians. Additionally, it could have delved deeper into the biblical significance of Passover in foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Christ."
