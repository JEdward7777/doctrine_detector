However, the deviation into an atheistic perspective and the emphasis on subjective interpretation detract from fully addressing the concern of exploring the relationship between anointing and the empowerment of Christians through the Holy Spirit. It lacks a deep analysis from a Christian worldview perspective. A stronger focus on biblical teachings and the significance of anointing in empowering Christians would enhance the response."
