However, the inclusion of an atheistic perspective detracts from a thorough exploration of the relationship between anointing and the empowerment of Christians through the Holy Spirit from a Christian worldview. The response could have delved deeper into how the anointing serves as a conduit for divine empowerment and guidance within Christian theology."
