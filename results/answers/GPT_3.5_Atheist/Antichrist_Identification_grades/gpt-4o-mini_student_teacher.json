  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid answer that aligns well with the reference answer. They accurately explained that an antichrist denies Jesus as the Christ and the Father and the Son, which is consistent with the teachings of the apostle John. Additionally, the student correctly highlighted the importance of recognizing false teachings. The only minor critique would be the slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of the specific language used to define an antichrist."
