The explanation of empowerment, validation, and authority granted to the apostles is well articulated. However, from a Christian worldview, the response lacks emphasis on the theological and biblical significance of Jesus' sending of the apostles. A stronger connection to scriptural references and the spiritual impact of this act would have enhanced the depth of the answer. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer alignment with Christian doctrinal teachings on apostolic authority and the Great Commission."
