However, the response lacks a clear connection to the specific concern of understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission. The answer could benefit from more explicit integration of the biblical mandate given to the apostles by Jesus to go and make disciples of all nations, which is fundamental to understanding their mission and purpose. Additionally, the theological depth and scriptural foundation present in the reference answer are missing in this response."
