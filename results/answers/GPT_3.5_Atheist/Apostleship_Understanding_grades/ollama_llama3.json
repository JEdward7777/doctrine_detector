  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission, providing a clear explanation of the significance of Jesus sending out the apostles and their subsequent empowerment. The response also highlights the validation of authority, legitimacy, and divine authority bestowed upon the apostles through this act.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical context and explored more specific examples from Scripture that support the idea that the apostles were sent with Christ's authority. Additionally, a stronger connection could be made between the sending of the apostles and the Great Commission itself, explicitly explaining how this event relates to Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations.\n\nComment: The response provides a solid foundation for understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission, but could benefit from further biblical analysis and explicit connections to Christ's mission."
