From a culturally retributive perspective, the sending of the apostles by Jesus holds significance in terms of religious power dynamics and authority. In this context, the act of sending the apostles can be seen as a form of empowerment and validation bestowed upon the disciples by Jesus himself. By being sent out to spread the gospel, the apostles were granted authority and legitimacy in the eyes of believers, establishing them as key figures in the early Christian community.

Furthermore, the sending of the apostles can also be interpreted as a symbolic act of entrusting them with a sacred mission and responsibility. This act elevated the status of the apostles and emphasized their role as messengers and representatives of Jesus, imbuing their words and actions with divine authority.

In summary, the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus lies in the validation of their authority, the empowerment for their mission, and the establishment of their role as central figures in the spread of the gospel.
