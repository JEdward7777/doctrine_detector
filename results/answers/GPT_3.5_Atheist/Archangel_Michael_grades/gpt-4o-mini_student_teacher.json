They demonstrated knowledge of the relevant Bible verses supporting this claim. However, the student could have further elaborated on how recognizing Michael's unique position as an archangel influences understanding of spiritual warfare and intercession from a Christian worldview. This additional depth of analysis would have strengthened their response."
