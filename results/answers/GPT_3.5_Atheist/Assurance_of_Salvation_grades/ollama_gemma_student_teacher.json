However, it lacks clarity on the specific biblical basis for such assurance and fails to address the teacher's concern of reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus. While it is appropriate to acknowledge the diverse beliefs and interpretations within different religious traditions, the answer could benefit from a more explicit recognition of the central role of faith in Christianity and its relationship to salvation."
