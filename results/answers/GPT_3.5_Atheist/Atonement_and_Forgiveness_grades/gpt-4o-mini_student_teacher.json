They accurately describe how atonement is the mechanism through which forgiveness is provided and reconciliation is achieved. However, the student could have delved deeper into the concept of atonement as a sacrificial payment for sin, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. A more in-depth exploration of this aspect would have strengthened their response."
