  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid interpretation of Romans 12:9, emphasizing the importance of genuine love and aligning actions with what is good to avoid hypocrisy. The answer effectively captures the essence of the verse and conveys the significance of sincerity and authenticity in demonstrating true love. Some improvement could be made by including a direct reference to abhorring what is evil as part of the characteristics mentioned in the question, but overall, this is a strong and doctrinally sound interpretation."
