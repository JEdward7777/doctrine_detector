  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has accurately captured the essence of Romans 12:9 in emphasizing the importance of sincerity and authenticity in love and actions to avoid hypocrisy. However, there was some slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of depth and precision. The student could have focused more on the aspect of avoiding deceitful or pretentious behavior explicitly mentioned in the reference answer to align more closely with a Christian worldview perspective."
