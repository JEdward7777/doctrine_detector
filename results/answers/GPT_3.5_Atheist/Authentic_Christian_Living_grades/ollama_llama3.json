  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does a good job of capturing the essence of Romans 12:9, highlighting the importance of genuine love and avoiding hypocrisy. It also makes some relevant connections to living out one's faith authentically, which aligns with the concern.\n\nHowever, I docked a few points because the response could be more explicit in its application of this principle to everyday life. While it mentions being \"true to ourselves and our beliefs,\" it would be strengthened by providing specific examples or concrete ways that people can embody love and goodness in their daily actions. Additionally, some minor language adjustments (e.g., using more precise theological terms) could enhance the overall clarity and impact of the response.\n\nOverall, a solid effort that could benefit from some refinement to make its points even more impactful!"
