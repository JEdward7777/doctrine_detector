However, from a Christian worldview, it could be improved by specifically mentioning that divine authority in Christianity comes from God as revealed in the Bible, and that it is the foundation of Christian beliefs, values, and actions. Additionally, emphasizing the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of divine authority for Christians would have further enhanced the answer."
