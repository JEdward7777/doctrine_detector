  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80. \n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive explanation of divine authority and its significance in the life of a believer. They have reflected on how divine authority shapes a believer's worldview, values, behavior, and decision-making process. \n\nHowever, the student's answer lacks a direct mention of the role of divine authority in discerning God's will and maintaining obedience, which was the specified concern. While the student has touched upon related themes, the answer could have been more focused on addressing the concern directly to receive a higher grade."
