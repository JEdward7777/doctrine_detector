## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, there are verses that suggest that governing authorities are established by God and should be obeyed. For example, in Romans 13:1-2, it says, "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves."

However, it is important to note that these verses were written in a specific historical and cultural context where early Christians were living under Roman rule. The Bible does not provide a comprehensive political philosophy or a detailed blueprint for governing, and interpretations of these verses may vary among different Christian denominations.

As an atheistic scholar, it is worth considering the historical and cultural context of these verses and the complex relationship between religion and governance. It is also important to respect diverse perspectives and beliefs on this topic while approaching it with critical inquiry and analysis.
