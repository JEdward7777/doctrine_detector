  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good explanation of the biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers as established by God, referencing Romans 13:1-2. However, deduct points for expressing an atheistic viewpoint and not emphasizing the importance of obeying governing authorities within the Christian worldview. Encouraging critical inquiry is valid, but in a Christian context, obedience to governing authorities as part of God's ordained structure of authority is a key principle."
