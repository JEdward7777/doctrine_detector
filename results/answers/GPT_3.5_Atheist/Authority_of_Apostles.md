## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The authority of the apostles in performing miracles and preaching boldly can be understood within the cultural context of the time. In ancient societies, individuals who claimed a divine connection or authority were often perceived as having special powers or abilities. The apostles, as followers of Jesus Christ, were seen as having a direct connection to the divine and were therefore believed to be able to perform miracles and speak with boldness.

From a scholarly and atheistic perspective, these miraculous abilities and bold preaching can be attributed to a combination of psychological factors, rhetorical skills, the power of suggestion, and potentially even some fraudulent practices. People's beliefs and expectations can play a significant role in how miraculous events are perceived and remembered.

It is important to critically analyze the historical accounts of the apostles' actions and consider the socio-cultural context in which they operated. While the apostles may have been influential figures in the spread of Christianity, their supposed divine authority should be viewed with a skeptical eye and understood within the framework of human psychology and cultural beliefs.
