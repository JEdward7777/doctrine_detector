  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The answer provided does not align with a Christian worldview on the authority of the apostles and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. It dismisses the divine aspect attributed to the apostles and instead presents a purely naturalistic and skeptical view. From a Christian perspective, the authority of the apostles stems from their direct connection to Jesus Christ and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, not merely from cultural perceptions or psychological factors. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and neglects to acknowledge the spiritual foundation of the apostles' authority."
