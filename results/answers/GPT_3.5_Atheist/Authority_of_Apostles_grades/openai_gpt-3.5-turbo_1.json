Instead, it focuses on a purely secular and skeptical perspective, lacking recognition of the spiritual dimension. A Christian worldview would emphasize the importance of faith, divine intervention, and the supernatural aspects of the apostles' ministry, which are essential elements in understanding their authority and actions."
