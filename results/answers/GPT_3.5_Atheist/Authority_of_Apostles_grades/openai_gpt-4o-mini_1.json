  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides a contrasting perspective that focuses more on naturalistic explanations and skepticism rather than exploring the divine empowerment and authority of the apostles as stated in the given answer. It does not adequately address the concern from a Christian worldview and does not give weight to the belief in God's intervention and empowerment of the apostles."
