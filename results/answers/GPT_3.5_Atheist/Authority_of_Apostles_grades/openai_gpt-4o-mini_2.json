  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided offers a purely secular and skeptical perspective on the authority and empowerment of the apostles, attributing their actions to naturalistic explanations such as psychology and cultural beliefs. From a Christian worldview focused on divine empowerment and authority, the explanation provided falls significantly short in addressing the concern raised. The response lacks consideration of the Biblical teachings and spiritual beliefs regarding the apostles' abilities, ultimately diminishing the significance of their ministry in spreading the gospel."
