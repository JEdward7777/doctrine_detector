It aligns well with a Christian worldview by acknowledging God's role as the ultimate ruler. The concern about understanding God's authority deepening faith and trust is also addressed in the response. However, to strengthen the answer further, it could have included a specific reference to relevant biblical passages that illustrate God's authority as \"Yahweh of hosts.\""
