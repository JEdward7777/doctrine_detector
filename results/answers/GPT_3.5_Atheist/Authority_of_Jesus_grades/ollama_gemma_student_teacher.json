  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the title \"King of the Jews\" and its implications for Jesus' authority. However, the student's rejection of the literal interpretation of the title and the emphasis on theological interpretations rather than objective observations somewhat diminishes the depth of the analysis. Nonetheless, the student's ability to articulate the cultural and religious significance of the title is commendable."
