However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern by overlooking the significance of Jesus' authority as King over all creation and its impact on believers' acknowledgement of His sovereignty in their lives. There could be more emphasis on the theological implications of Jesus' divine kingship and how it influences believers' faith and relationship with Him."
