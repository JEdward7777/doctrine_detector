However, it falls short in addressing the concern about understanding Jesus' authority and sovereignty in believers' lives. From a Christian worldview, Jesus' authority as King over all creation is not just a matter of religious belief but a foundational truth that shapes one's understanding of God's sovereignty and lordship. The response should have emphasized this aspect more clearly and connected it to believers' acknowledgement of Jesus' authority in their lives."
