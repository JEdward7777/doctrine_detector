However, the response falls short in fully embracing the divinity and significance of Jesus as the \"King of the Jews\" in a Christian context. It predominantly focuses on secular and atheistic perspectives, downplaying the theological importance of Jesus' title. There is room for a stronger affirmation of Jesus' divine kingship and sovereignty in the response."
