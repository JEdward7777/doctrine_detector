However, the response veered off track by discussing parental authority from a cultural and atheistic perspective, which is not in alignment with a Christian worldview. The student should have focused more on the theological underpinnings of parental authority according to Christian teachings, without diluting it with secular viewpoints. More emphasis on the divine origin and purpose of parental authority as outlined in Scripture would have strengthened the argument from a Christian specific worldview."
