  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student correctly identified some key figures traditionally attributed to writing the Psalms - King David, Solomon, and Asaph, they missed mentioning Moses. Additionally, the student provided good context about these figures being important in ancient Israelite history and the significance of the Book of Psalms in Jewish and Christian traditions. However, providing the information about Moses as one of the key figures would have further enhanced the understanding of the authorship of the Psalms and their messages."
