However, acknowledging the authorship of Psalms is crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of their messages and themes, as it provides insight into the backgrounds and perspectives of the writers. It is important to recognize the full scope of contributors to the Psalms to fully appreciate their significance in Jewish and Christian traditions."
