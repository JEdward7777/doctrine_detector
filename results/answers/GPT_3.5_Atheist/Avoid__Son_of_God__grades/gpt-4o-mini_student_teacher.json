  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of accurately conveying the religious and cultural concepts present in the original text, while also providing explanations to aid in understanding for readers from different cultural backgrounds. They acknowledge the specific theological significance of the term \"Son of God\" in monotheistic traditions and the need for context to prevent misunderstandings. The student's approach to maintaining the integrity and nuances of the original text, even if it may risk misinterpretations, is thoughtful.\n\nOverall, the student's response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer. The only slight deduction could be made for not directly mentioning the importance of teaching the term's meaning through context and explanation, as emphasized in the reference answer."
