  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-reasoned and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological and cultural complexities surrounding the term \"Son of God.\" The student effectively argues that while avoidance may seem like a solution to potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures, it can also lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. The emphasis on providing context and explanations while preserving the integrity of the original text is particularly commendable."
