  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response accurately addresses the concern that avoidance can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. It argues that instead of avoiding the term \"Son of God\", it should be carefully taught through context and explanation, which is in line with the given answer. The response also provides specific examples and justifications for its position, such as explaining the cultural and religious contexts of the original text and providing explanations or footnotes to aid understanding.\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is by being more explicit about the theological significance of Jesus' identity as the Son of God. While the response mentions that this term \"carries specific theological significance\" in monotheistic traditions, it could have gone further to elaborate on what this means and why it's important for Christian theology.\n\nOverall, however, the response provides a thoughtful and well-reasoned argument that effectively addresses the concern about avoidance leading to misunderstandings."
