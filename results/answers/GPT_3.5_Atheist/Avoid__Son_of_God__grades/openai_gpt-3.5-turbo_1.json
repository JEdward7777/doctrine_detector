It addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of teaching and explaining the term's meaning within its theological context to avoid misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. The only minor area for improvement would be to further emphasize the significance of maintaining theological integrity and providing clear explanations for readers to understand the term in its intended context."
