The explanation is clear and touches on the significance of each method. However, there is room for improvement in connecting these methods more directly with specific biblical references and theological considerations within different denominations. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the doctrinal significance of baptism and its connection to Christian beliefs could enhance the response."
