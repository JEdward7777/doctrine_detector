It acknowledges the diversity in practice among Christians while also recognizing the significance of baptism within specific theological and cultural contexts. The response could be strengthened by explicitly referencing specific biblical passages or theological considerations that support the different methods of baptism. Overall, a solid response from a Christian worldview perspective."
