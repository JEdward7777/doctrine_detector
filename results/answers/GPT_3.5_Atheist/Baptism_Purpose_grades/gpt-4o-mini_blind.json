  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: \nThe student provides a solid overview of the significance of baptism in the life of a Christian according to New Testament teachings. They correctly mention the symbolism of cleansing from sin, initiation into the community of believers, outward expression of faith, public declaration of commitment to Jesus, obedience to His command, and identification with His death, burial, and resurrection. However, they could improve by delving deeper into the spiritual significance of baptism as a symbol of dying to self and being raised to new life in Christ. Additionally, incorporating Scriptural references to support the points made would strengthen the answer. Overall, a good understanding is demonstrated, but there is room for more depth and theological grounding."
