  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a clear and detailed explanation of the significance of baptism in the Christian faith according to New Testament teachings. They accurately describe baptism as symbolizing the cleansing of sin, initiation into the community of believers, outward expression of faith, declaration of commitment to follow Jesus, and obedience to Jesus' command. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by emphasizing the core aspect of being cleansed from sin and united with Christ in line with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
