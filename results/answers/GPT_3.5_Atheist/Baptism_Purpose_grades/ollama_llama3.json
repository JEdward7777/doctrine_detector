  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does accurately convey that baptism symbolizes cleansing from sin and union with Christ, which aligns well with the given answer. It also provides additional context about the significance of baptism in the Christian faith, including its connection to Jesus' command and the demonstration of obedience. The mention of different denominations having varying interpretations is also a good nod towards the diversity of Christian practices.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by providing more depth and explanation on the importance of baptism in the Christian faith. For example, it would have been helpful to discuss how baptism is an act of repentance, a declaration of faith, or a public profession of one's commitment to follow Jesus. Additionally, while the response does mention the connection to Jesus' command and death/burial/resurrection, it could be more explicitly linked to salvation and justification.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the basics of baptism in the Christian faith, but could benefit from further development and explanation to truly demonstrate mastery of the concern."
