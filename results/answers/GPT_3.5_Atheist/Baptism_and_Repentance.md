## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Repentance and baptism are closely linked in the New Testament as part of the process of conversion and initiation into the Christian faith. Repentance, or a sincere turning away from sin and towards God, is a fundamental aspect of Christian belief and practice. Baptism, on the other hand, is a symbolic act of purification and rebirth, representing the washing away of sins and the welcoming of the individual into the Christian community.

In the New Testament, repentance is often presented as a prerequisite for baptism. For example, in Acts 2:38, Peter instructs the crowd to "repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins." This suggests that repentance is necessary before one can be baptized and receive the forgiveness of sins.

Additionally, baptism is often understood as a public declaration of one's faith and commitment to following Christ. Through baptism, the individual is symbolically cleansed of their sins and united with Christ in his death and resurrection. This act of initiation marks the beginning of their new life as a Christian.

Overall, repentance and baptism are closely connected in the New Testament as essential components of the Christian conversion experience. Repentance signifies a genuine turning towards God, while baptism symbolizes the cleansing of sin and the beginning of a new life in Christ.
