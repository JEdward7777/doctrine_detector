  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a good understanding of the relationship between repentance and baptism in the New Testament, highlighting how repentance is often presented as a prerequisite for baptism. Their explanation of the symbolic significance of baptism and its role in the initiation into the Christian faith is clear and accurate. However, there is some unnecessary elaboration and repetition in the response that could have been more concise. Overall, a solid explanation from a Christian worldview with room for minor improvements."
