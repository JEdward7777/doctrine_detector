  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of being gracious in interactions with others, emphasizing empathy, respect, and consideration. However, the answer does not directly address the Christian obligation to be forgiving and kind as highlighted in the concern. A Christian-specific worldview would expect the student to focus more on extending forgiveness and kindness, especially towards those who have wronged us. The absence of this vital aspect lowers the grade."
