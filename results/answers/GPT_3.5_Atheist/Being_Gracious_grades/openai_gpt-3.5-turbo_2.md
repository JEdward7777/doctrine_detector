The term "gracious" typically means showing kindness, courtesy, and politeness towards others, often in a generous and understanding manner. When we are gracious in our interactions with others, we are demonstrating empathy, respect, and consideration for their feelings and perspectives. This fosters positive relationships, promotes harmony, and encourages mutual understanding and cooperation.
