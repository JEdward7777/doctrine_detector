  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that accurately explains the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings. The response goes beyond just stating the beliefs and delves into their significance for the Pharisees' worldview. It effectively addresses the concern by enhancing understanding of the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time. The only slight deduction is for the additional details not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer, which could have been more concise."
