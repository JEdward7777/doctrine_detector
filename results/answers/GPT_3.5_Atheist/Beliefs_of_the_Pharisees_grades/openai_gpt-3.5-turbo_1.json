  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the Pharisees' beliefs, focusing on their belief in an afterlife and spiritual beings, which differentiates them from other Jewish groups like the Sadducees. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding these beliefs can enhance our knowledge of the spiritual environment during Jesus' time. Overall, a well-articulated and well-supported response."
