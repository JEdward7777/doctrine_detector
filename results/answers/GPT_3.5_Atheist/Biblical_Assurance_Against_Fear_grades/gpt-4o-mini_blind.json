  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the significance of the phrase \"fear not\" in the Bible in terms of God's assurance to believers. They correctly highlighted the message of God's presence, care, protection, and encouragement to trust in Him. The response effectively conveyed the idea that God is in control and offers comfort and strength. Good job overall, but could have included more specific scriptural references to support their points."
