Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided accurate verses that emphasize the importance of forgiveness among individuals, showing a good understanding of the concept. However, they missed referencing Matthew 6:14-15, which is a key verse on forgiveness. Encouraging the student to include a wider range of verses would strengthen their answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
