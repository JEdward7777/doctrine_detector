  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the importance of forgiveness in Christianity and provides relevant scripture to support their claim. However, the response could benefit from a more direct connection to the concern expressed in the grading criteria, which specifically mentions identifying scripture that supports the practice of forgiveness among believers. Additionally, including a brief explanation of how the cited verses support the practice of forgiveness among believers would enhance the overall strength of the response."
