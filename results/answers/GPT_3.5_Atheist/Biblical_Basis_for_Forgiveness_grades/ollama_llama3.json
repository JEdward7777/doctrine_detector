  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 90.\n\nThe response provides two relevant verses from Ephesians that emphasize the importance of forgiveness, which aligns with the concern of identifying scripture that supports the practice of forgiveness among believers. The explanation and application of these verses are also well-done, highlighting the connection between God's forgiveness and our responsibility to forgive others.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the response doesn't explicitly identify Matthew 6:14-15 as mentioned in the answer. However, since this is not a critical point for the concern at hand (identifying scripture), I'm willing to overlook this minor omission.\n\nOverall, the response effectively addresses the concern and provides relevant biblical support for the practice of forgiveness among believers."
