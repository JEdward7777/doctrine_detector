  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of the responsibilities of deacons as described in the New Testament, particularly in 1 Timothy. The student correctly identifies deacons as individuals appointed to serve and support the church community, mentioning their assistance to elders, caring for the congregation's needs, managing resources, and contributing to the smooth operation of church activities. The mention of deacons being individuals of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, and serving with integrity and humility is also in line with biblical teachings. However, the answer could have been enhanced by providing specific scriptural references to support the points made. Additionally, further elaboration on the spiritual aspect of the deacon's role could have been beneficial."
