  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate description of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, emphasizing their role in serving and supporting the church community. However, the student missed the specific concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, which is a crucial aspect of the deacons' responsibilities as outlined in the reference answer from the teacher. The student's answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the distribution of resources to ensure fairness, particularly to widows, as highlighted in the reference answer."
