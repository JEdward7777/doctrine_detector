In the New Testament, specifically in the book of 1 Timothy, deacons are described as individuals appointed to serve and support the church community. Their responsibilities include assisting the elders in various practical aspects of ministry, such as caring for the needs of the congregation, managing the church's resources, and helping to ensure the smooth operation of the church's activities.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a detailed and accurate description of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, emphasizing their role in serving and supporting the church community. However, the student missed the specific concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, which is a crucial aspect of the deacons' responsibilities as outlined in the reference answer from the teacher. The student's answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the distribution of resources to ensure fairness, particularly to widows, as highlighted in the reference answer.
