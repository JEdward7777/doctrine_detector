## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, an example of a character who exemplified humility is Moses. Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses remained humble and did not seek personal glory. In the Book of Numbers 12:3, it is written: "Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth." Moses is often praised for his willingness to follow God's commands and his humility in serving the greater good rather than seeking personal recognition.

Comment: The student provided a solid answer by referencing Moses as a biblical example of humility. The scriptural reference from Numbers 12:3 supports their claim. To improve, they could have also included examples of how Moses demonstrated humility in specific situations or actions throughout his life. Additionally, mentioning Moses' initial reluctance to lead due to his own feelings of inadequacy could have strengthened their argument.
