  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a strong example of humility in Moses from Numbers 12:3, showcasing his humility in serving God rather than seeking personal recognition. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by using the reference answer provided by the teacher, which specifically mentioned David as an example of humility. By incorporating the reference answer or expanding on biblical examples of humility beyond Moses, the student could have demonstrated a deeper understanding of the concept within a Christian worldview."
