  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical character of Moses and his exemplary humility. The reference to Numbers 12:3 reinforces the notion that Moses was indeed a humble man. The student's explanation of Moses' willingness to serve God and the greater good aligns well with the Christian worldview of humility as a virtue that involves putting the needs of others before oneself. However, the student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on other notable instances of humility displayed by Moses in the Bible."
