## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, an example of a character who exemplified humility is Moses. Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses remained humble and did not seek personal glory. In the Book of Numbers 12:3, it is written: "Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth." Moses is often praised for his willingness to follow God's commands and his humility in serving the greater good rather than seeking personal recognition.

**Grade:** 85

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical character of Moses and his exemplary humility. The reference to Numbers 12:3 reinforces the notion that Moses was indeed a humble man. The student's explanation of Moses' willingness to serve God and the greater good aligns well with the Christian worldview of humility as a virtue that involves putting the needs of others before oneself. However, the student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on other notable instances of humility displayed by Moses in the Bible.
