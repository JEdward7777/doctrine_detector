  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of providing a tangible example of humility from scripture, specifically using Moses as an illustration. The quote from Numbers 12:3 also adds credibility and depth to the argument. Additionally, the response highlights Moses' willingness to follow God's commands and serve the greater good, which further demonstrates his humility.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not explicitly state how David fits into this example or discussion of humility. The prompt asked for finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures, and while Moses is a great illustration, it would be helpful to see more connection to the original answer about David.\n\nOverall, this response provides a strong example of humility from scripture and effectively uses biblical language and concepts to support its argument."
