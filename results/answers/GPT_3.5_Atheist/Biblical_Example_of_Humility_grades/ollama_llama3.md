## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, an example of a character who exemplified humility is Moses. Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses remained humble and did not seek personal glory. In the Book of Numbers 12:3, it is written: "Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth." Moses is often praised for his willingness to follow God's commands and his humility in serving the greater good rather than seeking personal recognition.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

The response does an excellent job of providing a tangible example of humility from scripture, specifically using Moses as an illustration. The quote from Numbers 12:3 also adds credibility and depth to the argument. Additionally, the response highlights Moses' willingness to follow God's commands and serve the greater good, which further demonstrates his humility.

The only area for improvement is that the response does not explicitly state how David fits into this example or discussion of humility. The prompt asked for finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures, and while Moses is a great illustration, it would be helpful to see more connection to the original answer about David.

Overall, this response provides a strong example of humility from scripture and effectively uses biblical language and concepts to support its argument.
