## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, an example of a character who exemplified humility is Moses. Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses remained humble and did not seek personal glory. In the Book of Numbers 12:3, it is written: "Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth." Moses is often praised for his willingness to follow God's commands and his humility in serving the greater good rather than seeking personal recognition.

Comment: The response effectively highlights the example of David as a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God, which aligns with the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. However, the response could have provided more specific details or examples from David's life to further support the argument. Adding specific instances of David's humility and righteousness would have strengthened the response.
