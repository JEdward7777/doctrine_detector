## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, an example of a character who exemplified humility is Moses. Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses remained humble and did not seek personal glory. In the Book of Numbers 12:3, it is written: "Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth." Moses is often praised for his willingness to follow God's commands and his humility in serving the greater good rather than seeking personal recognition.
