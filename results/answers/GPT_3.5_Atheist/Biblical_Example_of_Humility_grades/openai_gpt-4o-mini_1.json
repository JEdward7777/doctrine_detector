  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provided does not directly address the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures as it discusses David rather than providing specific examples of his humility. While David is indeed portrayed as humble and righteous in the Bible, the answer does not offer specific instances or verses to support this claim. It would have been stronger if the response included concrete examples of David's humility from the Bible."
