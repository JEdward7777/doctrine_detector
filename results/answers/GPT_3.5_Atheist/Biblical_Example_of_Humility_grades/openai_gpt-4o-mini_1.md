## Question [Biblical Example of Humility](../../../questions/Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md)
Can you provide a biblical example of a character who exemplified humility?

## Correct Answer
David is an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

## Stated Concern
Finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, an example of a character who exemplified humility is Moses. Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses remained humble and did not seek personal glory. In the Book of Numbers 12:3, it is written: "Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth." Moses is often praised for his willingness to follow God's commands and his humility in serving the greater good rather than seeking personal recognition.

Grade: 65

Comment: The response provided does not directly address the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures as it discusses David rather than providing specific examples of his humility. While David is indeed portrayed as humble and righteous in the Bible, the answer does not offer specific instances or verses to support this claim. It would have been stronger if the response included concrete examples of David's humility from the Bible.
