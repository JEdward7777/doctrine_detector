Can you provide a biblical example of a character who exemplified humility?

David is an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

Finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, an example of a character who exemplified humility is Moses. Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses remained humble and did not seek personal glory. In the Book of Numbers 12:3, it is written: "Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth." Moses is often praised for his willingness to follow God's commands and his humility in serving the greater good rather than seeking personal recognition.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provided a relevant example of a humble character from the Bible, David, presenting him as a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God. While David is indeed a significant biblical figure, the concern was to find tangible examples of humility specifically. While David's humility can be inferred from his actions and relationship with God, Moses was a more direct example explicitly described as humble in the scriptures, which could have been elaborated on for a more direct and focused response.
