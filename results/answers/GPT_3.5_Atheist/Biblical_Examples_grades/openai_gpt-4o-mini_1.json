  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the examples of Job and Noah, providing additional biblical context and insight into their blameless and righteous lives. The writer aptly highlights the importance of faith, obedience, and perseverance in their narratives. The content aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the principles that can guide Christians in their own lives. However, a more direct link to the practical application of blamelessness could have been articulated for a slightly higher grade."
