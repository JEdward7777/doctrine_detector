  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the passage in Genesis 1:28 where God blesses the living creatures. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher suggests that the blessing is found in Genesis 1:22, which refers to the blessing of the sea creatures and birds. While both passages reflect God's blessing on creation, the specific example provided by the student aligns more closely with the question."
