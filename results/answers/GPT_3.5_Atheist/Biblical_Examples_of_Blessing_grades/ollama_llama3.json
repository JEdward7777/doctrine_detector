  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe student correctly references Genesis as the book that contains God's blessing, which shows they understand the importance of biblical context. They also mention the phrase \"be fruitful and increase in number\" which is part of the correct verse (Genesis 1:28). However, their statement that the blessing signifies God's intention for creation to thrive and flourish could be more explicitly connected to the concept of blessings illustrated in scripture.\n\nA perfect score would require the student to demonstrate a clear connection between this specific biblical account and the broader theme of blessings throughout Scripture. For example, they could have discussed how this blessing is similar to others in Scripture that express God's favor and provision (e.g., Joseph's blessing from Pharaoh, or Jesus' blessing on the bread)."
