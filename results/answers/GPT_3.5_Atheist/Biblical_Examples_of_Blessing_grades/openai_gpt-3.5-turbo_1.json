  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response accurately references a specific verse in Genesis where God blesses the creatures of the sea and the birds, instructing them to \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" However, there was a slight error in the verse citation provided in the original answer. The student demonstrated a good understanding of how blessings are illustrated in scripture, but could have provided a more precise reference to enhance the accuracy of the response."
