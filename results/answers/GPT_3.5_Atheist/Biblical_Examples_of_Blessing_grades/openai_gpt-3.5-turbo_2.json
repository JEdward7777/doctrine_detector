  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately references Genesis 1:22 which discusses God blessing the sea creatures and birds with the instruction to be fruitful and multiply. This aligns well with the concern of understanding how blessings are illustrated in scripture. The only improvement could be a more detailed explanation connecting the concept of blessings in this specific context to God's overall intention for creation to thrive and flourish, as mentioned in the sample response."
