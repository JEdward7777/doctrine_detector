  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student accurately referenced a specific verse in Genesis 1:22 where God blesses the creatures of the sea and the birds, instructing them to be fruitful and multiply. However, there was a slight misinterpretation in the original response, as the verse mentioned pertains to the sea creatures and birds specifically, not all living creatures. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of how blessings are illustrated in scripture."
