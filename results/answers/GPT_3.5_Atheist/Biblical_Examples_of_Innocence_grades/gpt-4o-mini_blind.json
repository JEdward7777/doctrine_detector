  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: \nThis answer effectively references key passages in Scripture that illustrate the innocence of Jesus in the context of his interactions with his accusers. The use of specific examples, such as Jesus' trial before Pilate and before the high priest, demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical narrative. The reflection on the importance of seeking justice and fairness aligns well with Christian teachings. However, to enhance the grade, the student could have delved deeper into the theological significance of Jesus' innocence and how it relates to Christian beliefs about redemption and the atonement. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological reflection."
