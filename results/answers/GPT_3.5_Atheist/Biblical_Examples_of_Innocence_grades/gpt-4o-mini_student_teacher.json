  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student effectively references the trial of Jesus before Pilate and his silence before the high priest and Sanhedrin as examples of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. However, the student missed including the specific references mentioned in the teacher's answer - Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not. Including these specific examples would have strengthened the student's answer in alignment with the concern provided."
