  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that effectively analyzes the theme of innocence in the biblical narrative concerning Jesus and his accusers. The student provides clear and relevant examples from Scripture to support their claims. However, the response could be strengthened by including additional references to other instances in Scripture where the concept of innocence is highlighted."
