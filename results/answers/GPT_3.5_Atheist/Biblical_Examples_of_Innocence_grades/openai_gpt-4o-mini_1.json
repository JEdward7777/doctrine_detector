The references to Luke 23:47 and the acknowledgment of innocence by the other criminal during the crucifixion are relevant and align with the Christian view of Jesus' innocence. The response could have further elaborated on the significance of these examples within the Christian faith, but overall, it is a strong and cohesive explanation."
