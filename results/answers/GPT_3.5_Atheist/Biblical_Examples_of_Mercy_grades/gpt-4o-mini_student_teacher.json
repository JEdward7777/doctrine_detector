  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student provided strong examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy, such as the Prodigal Son, the woman caught in adultery, the Good Samaritan, and Jesus healing the lepers, they missed out on including a key example referenced in the teacher's answer - the tax collector's prayer for mercy in Luke 18:13. Encouraging the student to incorporate this additional example would enhance the comprehensiveness of their response and deepen their understanding of mercy within a scriptural context."
