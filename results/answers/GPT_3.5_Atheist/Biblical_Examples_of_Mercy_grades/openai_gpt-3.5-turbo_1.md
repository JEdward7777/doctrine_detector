In the Bible, there are several key examples that illustrate the concept of mercy:

1. The story of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) displays the father's unconditional love and forgiveness towards his wayward son, symbolizing God's mercy towards repentant sinners.

2. The tale of Jesus forgiving the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11) emphasizes the importance of showing mercy and compassion towards those who have made mistakes.

3. The parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) teaches the lesson of showing mercy and kindness to strangers, regardless of their background or beliefs.

4. The account of Jesus healing the lepers (Luke 17:11-19) demonstrates God's mercy in providing physical and spiritual healing to those who are marginalized and suffering.

These examples offer insight into the biblical concept of mercy as a fundamental aspect of God's character and a virtue to be practiced by believers towards others.
