The references to the story of the Prodigal Son, Jesus forgiving the woman caught in adultery, the Good Samaritan parable, and Jesus healing the lepers effectively highlight the concept of mercy in Christian teachings. The examples are well-chosen and demonstrate a clear understanding of how mercy is expressed in both scripture and real-life situations."
