  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response effectively incorporates examples from the Bible that illustrate the significance of prayer in fostering a stronger prayer life, aligning well with the concern provided. However, the response lacks a direct connection between the examples provided and how they can be practically applied by believers today to strengthen their own prayer lives. Encouraging a more explicit link between the biblical stories and present-day application would enhance the overall response."
