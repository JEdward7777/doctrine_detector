  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples of repentance from the Bible and effectively explained how each individual acknowledged their sins, expressed remorse, and sought forgiveness. However, the student could have included more direct references to specific verses in the Bible to support their examples, as done in the reference answer. By incorporating more specific citations, the student's response would have been more thoroughly grounded in biblical evidence."
