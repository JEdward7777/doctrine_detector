  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the concept of transgression in the Bible by referencing well-known stories like Adam and Eve and the Ten Commandments. However, the student could have improved the answer by including specific Biblical references that illustrate transgression, as provided in the reference answer from the teacher. Incorporating direct scripture references would have strengthened the student's response in connecting biblical examples to the concept of transgression."
