  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of trespass in the Bible and provides relevant examples from both the Old and New Testaments. The explanation of David's trespass and subsequent repentance is particularly well-articulated. Additionally, the connection between trespass and sin, accountability, and reconciliation is clearly established. \n\nHowever, the response would benefit from including more specific references to the biblical passages mentioned, including verses or chapter/verse references for each example provided. This would enhance the credibility and clarity of the answer."
