  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 90. The student effectively references the passage in Exodus where worship is contrasted with idol worship and accurately explains the significance of this contrast in terms of obeying God's commandments and avoiding idolatry. The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the importance of worshiping the one true God and the consequences of idol worship. Great job overall!"
