  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively references the specified Bible passage from Exodus and correctly contrasts the worship of the one true God with idol worship. The emphasis on the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship is appropriately addressed. The addition of specific verses and clear explanation could further enhance the response and provide a deeper analysis of the contrast between worshiping God and worshiping idols from a Christian worldview perspective."
