Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly, one example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship can be found in the Book of Exodus. In Exodus 20:3-5, God commands the Israelites: "You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God."

This passage clearly emphasizes the importance of worshiping the one true God and not idols, as worshiping idols is seen as a violation of God's commandment. The contrast is clear - worshiping the true God is righteous and pleasing to Him, while worshiping idols is condemned and considered sinful.
