## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I view the teachings of Jesus from a historical and cultural perspective rather than a religious one. According to the New Testament accounts, Jesus instructed his apostles to spread the good news of the Gospel to all nations and make disciples of all people. This directive, known as the Great Commission, reflects the missionary aspect of early Christianity and the zeal to share the message of salvation with others. From a sociological standpoint, this mission helped the early Christian community to grow and establish itself as a significant religious movement in the Roman world.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)

Grade: 60

Comment: The student displayed a clear understanding of the historical context of Jesus' directive to his apostles and the significance of the Great Commission in early Christianity. However, the viewpoint presented lacks acknowledgment of the spiritual and divine aspects of the Great Commission according to Christian belief. It is important to emphasize the supernatural mandate and spiritual significance behind Jesus' instruction to spread the good news, which goes beyond a mere sociological or historical perspective.
