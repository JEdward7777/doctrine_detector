## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I view the teachings of Jesus from a historical and cultural perspective rather than a religious one. According to the New Testament accounts, Jesus instructed his apostles to spread the good news of the Gospel to all nations and make disciples of all people. This directive, known as the Great Commission, reflects the missionary aspect of early Christianity and the zeal to share the message of salvation with others. From a sociological standpoint, this mission helped the early Christian community to grow and establish itself as a significant religious movement in the Roman world.

## Grade: 70

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern regarding the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith. They correctly identify the Great Commission as the directive given by Jesus to his apostles regarding the spread of the good news. However, the answer lacks any reference to the Christian worldview or the need for faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. While the historical and sociological aspects of the Great Commission are mentioned, the response does not engage with the Christian belief that the Gospel is about personal salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
