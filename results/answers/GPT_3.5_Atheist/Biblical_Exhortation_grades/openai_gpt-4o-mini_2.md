## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I view the teachings of Jesus from a historical and cultural perspective rather than a religious one. According to the New Testament accounts, Jesus instructed his apostles to spread the good news of the Gospel to all nations and make disciples of all people. This directive, known as the Great Commission, reflects the missionary aspect of early Christianity and the zeal to share the message of salvation with others. From a sociological standpoint, this mission helped the early Christian community to grow and establish itself as a significant religious movement in the Roman world.

Grade: 20

Comment: The atheistic scholar's response fails to recognize the true significance and urgency of evangelism in the Christian faith. It reduces Jesus' directive to a mere historical and sociological phenomenon rather than acknowledging the spiritual importance of spreading the message of salvation. From a Christian worldview, evangelism is a central aspect of following Christ and fulfilling the Great Commission is crucial for believers.
