  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-articulated explanation of how the references to Jesus as 'King of the Jews' in the Bible align with Old Testament prophecies regarding the promised Messiah from the line of David. The student effectively connects prophecies from Isaiah and Jeremiah to Jesus' identity as the fulfillment of these promises. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to include more specific references to additional Old Testament prophecies that foretold the coming of a king. Overall, a strong answer demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic."
