  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer connecting the references to Jesus as 'King of the Jews' in the Bible to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah coming from David's line. The response effectively highlights the fulfillment of these prophecies in Jesus. There is a strong alignment with Christian theology regarding prophecy and its fulfillment. The answer could have been improved by directly addressing the teacher's concise reference answer and by being more concise in some areas. Overall, a solid understanding and explanation were demonstrated."
