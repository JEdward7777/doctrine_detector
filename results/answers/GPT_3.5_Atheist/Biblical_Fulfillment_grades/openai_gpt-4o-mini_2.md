## [Answer](../Biblical_Fulfillment.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The portrayal of Jesus as the 'King of the Jews' in the Bible can be seen as reflecting Old Testament prophecies, particularly in connection with the Messianic prophecies found in the Hebrew scriptures. In the Old Testament, there are numerous references to a future king who will come from the line of David to rule over God's people.

For example, in the book of Isaiah, there are prophecies about a ruler who will bring justice and righteousness to the nations (Isaiah 9:6-7), and in Jeremiah, there are prophecies about a righteous branch from the line of David who will reign as king (Jeremiah 23:5-6). These and other prophecies are believed by Christians to have been fulfilled in Jesus, who is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of the promised Jewish Messiah.

Therefore, when Jesus is referred to as the 'King of the Jews' in the New Testament, it is understood as a fulfillment of these Old Testament prophecies about a coming king who would establish God's kingdom on earth. This title highlights Jesus' role as the long-awaited Jewish Messiah who has come to fulfill the promises of God made to the people of Israel.
