  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of how the Bible illustrates the consequences of guilt and sin, referencing stories like Adam and Eve and the Israelites. However, the answer lacks a clear connection to the seriousness of sin and the need to appreciate God's grace and mercy. To improve, the student should have included specific Bible verses like the reference answer did to strengthen their argument from a Christian worldview perspective."
