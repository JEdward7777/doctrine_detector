## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In studying the Bible from an atheistic perspective, it is important to approach the text with an understanding of its cultural and historical context. The concept of God's majesty is depicted in various verses throughout the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament.

One example of highlighting God's majesty can be found in Psalm 93:1-2: "The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength; indeed, the world is established, firm and secure. Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity."

Additionally, Isaiah 40:12 describes God's greatness and power: "Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance?"

These verses reflect the awe-inspiring nature of God's majesty in the eyes of believers. However, as an atheistic scholar, I view these verses through a lens of cultural retribution, understanding them as products of human imagination and societal norms of the time, rather than objective truths about a divine being.
