However, the concern raised is that the student is interpreting these verses from an atheistic perspective, viewing them merely as products of human imagination and societal norms. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to recognize these verses as revelations of God's majesty and not dismiss them as mere cultural constructs. The student's interpretation lacks acknowledgment of the divine nature and authority attributed to God in these passages."
