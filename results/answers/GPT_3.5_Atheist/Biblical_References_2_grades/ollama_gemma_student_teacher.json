They provide relevant biblical passages to support their claims. However, their atheism perspective limits the depth of their engagement with the question from a Christian worldview. The inclusion of verses from Psalms and Isaiah aligns with the reference answer, but the student's explanation of these verses as products of cultural retribution weakens their connection to the concept of God's majesty."
