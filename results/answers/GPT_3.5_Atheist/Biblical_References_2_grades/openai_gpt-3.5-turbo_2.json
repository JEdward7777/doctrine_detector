However, the initial discussion from an atheistic perspective undermines the acknowledgement of God's majesty portrayed in the Bible. From a Christian worldview, it is important to approach the Bible with faith and reverence for the divine nature of God, rather than dismissing it as a product of human imagination and societal norms."
