## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, the concept of the "Son of Man" is primarily found in the Book of Daniel. In Daniel 7:13-14, it says, "In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed."

This passage is often interpreted as a vision of the future coming of a messianic figure who will be given dominion and authority by God. The "Son of Man" in this context is seen as a divine figure who will establish a kingdom that will endure forever.

In the New Testament, especially in the Gospels, Jesus frequently refers to himself as the "Son of Man," drawing on the imagery from the Book of Daniel. By associating himself with this figure, Jesus is asserting his messianic identity and his divine authority as the one who will fulfill the prophecies about the coming of the Messiah.

Overall, the concept of the "Son of Man" in the Old Testament contributes to the understanding of the coming Messiah as a figure of great authority and power, who will establish an everlasting kingdom under the sovereignty of God.
