  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the \"Son of Man\" in the Old Testament, specifically referencing Daniel 7:13-14. The student correctly ties this concept to the understanding of the coming Messiah as a figure with divine authority. The answer could be improved by expanding on other Old Testament references that also contribute to the understanding of the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah, providing a more comprehensive overview. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound response."
