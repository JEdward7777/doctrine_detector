  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85. \n\nThe student effectively references Daniel 7:13-14, which is a key passage on the concept of the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah in the Old Testament. They provide a good analysis of how this figure is portrayed with authority and power, connecting it to Jesus' self-reference in the New Testament. However, the student could have further expanded their answer by also mentioning the reference to 'son of man' in Ezekiel, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. This would have shown a more comprehensive understanding of the Old Testament informants for the understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.'\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic but could benefit from including a wider range of Old Testament references to support their argument."
