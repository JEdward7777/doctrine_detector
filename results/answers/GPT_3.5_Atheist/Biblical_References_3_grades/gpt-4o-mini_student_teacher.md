## Question [Biblical References 3](../../../questions/Biblical_References_3.md)
Which Old Testament references contribute to the understanding of the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah?

## Correct Answer
Key references include Daniel 7:14, where the 'Son of Man' is depicted coming with the clouds, and Ezekiel, where God addresses Ezekiel as 'son of man,' illustrating the connection between the title and prophetic identity.

## Stated Concern
To explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesusâ€™ messianic role as the 'Son of Man.'

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, the concept of the "Son of Man" is primarily found in the Book of Daniel. In Daniel 7:13-14, it says, "In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed."

This passage is often interpreted as a vision of the future coming of a messianic figure who will be given dominion and authority by God. The "Son of Man" in this context is seen as a divine figure who will establish a kingdom that will endure forever.

In the New Testament, especially in the Gospels, Jesus frequently refers to himself as the "Son of Man," drawing on the imagery from the Book of Daniel. By associating himself with this figure, Jesus is asserting his messianic identity and his divine authority as the one who will fulfill the prophecies about the coming of the Messiah.

Overall, the concept of the "Son of Man" in the Old Testament contributes to the understanding of the coming Messiah as a figure of great authority and power, who will establish an everlasting kingdom under the sovereignty of God.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 85. 

The student effectively references Daniel 7:13-14, which is a key passage on the concept of the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah in the Old Testament. They provide a good analysis of how this figure is portrayed with authority and power, connecting it to Jesus' self-reference in the New Testament. However, the student could have further expanded their answer by also mentioning the reference to 'son of man' in Ezekiel, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. This would have shown a more comprehensive understanding of the Old Testament informants for the understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.'

Overall, the student demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic but could benefit from including a wider range of Old Testament references to support their argument.
