  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the Old Testament concept of the \"Son of Man\" in Daniel 7:13-14, as well as its connection to Jesus' messianic identity in the New Testament. The discussion is clear and concise, and the writer provides relevant biblical references to support their points.\n\nHowever, I would give a lower grade due to the lack of depth and nuance in the response. The writer could have explored more fully the ways in which the Old Testament concept of the \"Son of Man\" informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role, particularly with regards to its implications for Jesus' divinity and authority.\n\nThe provided answer is a good starting point, but it could be expanded upon to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Additionally, while the concern is somewhat addressed, it could be further explored in terms of how the Old Testament concept of the \"Son of Man\" shapes our understanding of Jesus' messianic role and its significance for Christian theology.\n\nComment: Overall, this response demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical context surrounding the concept of the \"Son of Man.\" However, to achieve a higher grade, the writer could have delved deeper into the theological implications of this concept and explored its significance for understanding Jesus' messianic role in more detail."
