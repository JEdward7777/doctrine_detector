It effectively connects the Old Testament understanding of the title \"Son of Man\" to its significance in the New Testament, particularly in relation to Jesus' messianic role. The inclusion of key references and the explanation of prophetic identity enhances the understanding of how the Old Testament informs the New Testament's portrayal of Jesus as the \"Son of Man.\""
