It accurately references key passages such as Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel to demonstrate the prophetic identity associated with the title. The explanation is clear, cohesive, and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective. A minor improvement could be providing more specific examples or explanations to further strengthen the argument."
