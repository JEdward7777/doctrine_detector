It effectively connects the imagery from Daniel and Ezekiel to Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" in the Gospels, highlighting the continuity and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in the New Testament. The response demonstrates a solid grasp of the theological significance of the \"Son of Man\" title in both the Old and New Testaments from a Christian worldview perspective."
