  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of how the term \"Lord\" is used in biblical references to acknowledge God's authority and divinity. The examples given are relevant and support the importance of recognizing God's authority as Lord. The response could be strengthened by providing a more detailed explanation of the chosen biblical passages and how they specifically emphasize God's authority and sovereignty. Overall, a strong response from a Christian worldview perspective."
