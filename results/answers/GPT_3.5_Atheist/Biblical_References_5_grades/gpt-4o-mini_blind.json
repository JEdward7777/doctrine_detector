  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the connection between unleavened bread and Christian teachings, particularly in the context of the Last Supper and the establishment of Holy Communion. The student accurately references Luke 22:19 and articulates the symbolic significance of using unleavened bread in this ritual. The answer could be further enhanced by mentioning the Passover connection to unleavened bread as a foreshadowing element in the Old Testament that finds fulfillment in the New Testament through Christ's sacrifice. Overall, a well-supported and doctrinally accurate response."
