  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student did provide a valid New Testament scripture (Luke 22:19) that connects unleavened bread to Christian teachings through the institution of the Eucharist, the teacher's reference answer from 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 is more direct in addressing the concept of unleavened bread in relation to removing sin from the church and Christian life. The student's answer effectively explains the symbolism and significance of unleavened bread in the context of the Last Supper, but could have been improved by also referencing the more direct passage from 1 Corinthians."
