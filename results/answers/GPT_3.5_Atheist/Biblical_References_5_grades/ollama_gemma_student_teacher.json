  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the connection between unleavened bread and Christian teachings, specifically referencing the Last Supper and the establishment of Holy Communion. The explanation of the symbolic use of unleavened bread is clear and concise. However, the inclusion of 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 as an additional reference strengthens the overall response."
