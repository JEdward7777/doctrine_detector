  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does identify a relevant biblical text (Luke 22:19) that provides insight into Christian practices, specifically the concept of unleavened bread in the context of Holy Communion or the Eucharist. However, it fails to acknowledge the specified answer (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) and its relevance to the concern.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the Luke passage to the concern about Christian practices and also addressed the specified answer in relation to the concern. As it stands, while the response provides some relevant biblical context, it does not fully engage with the specified answer or demonstrate a clear understanding of its connection to the concern.\n\nComment: While the response is generally accurate and addresses the concern, it could be improved by more explicitly addressing the specified answer and its relevance to the topic."
