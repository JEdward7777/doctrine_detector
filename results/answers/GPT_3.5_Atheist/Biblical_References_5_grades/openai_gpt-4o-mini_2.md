## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The New Testament scripture that connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings is found in the Gospel of Luke, specifically in Luke 22:19 during the Last Supper. In this passage, Jesus takes bread, gives thanks, breaks it, and gives it to his disciples saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me." This event is often seen as the establishment of the Christian ritual of Holy Communion or the Eucharist, where believers partake of bread and wine symbolizing Jesus' body and blood. The use of unleavened bread in this context is symbolic of purity and sincerity, emphasizing the idea of a new beginning and freedom from sin.
