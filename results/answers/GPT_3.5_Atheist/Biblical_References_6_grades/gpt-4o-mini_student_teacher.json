They accurately reference key verses such as 1 Corinthians 15:22, John 11:25-26, and Daniel 12:2-3, showcasing an understanding of the significance of resurrection in Christian doctrine. While their selection of verses is slightly different from the reference answer, their explanation is well-rounded and grounded in scriptural support, aligning with the concern of focusing on authoritative Christian texts. Overall, this is a strong and well-supported response."
