## [Answer](../Biblical_References_6.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of resurrection is central to Christian doctrine and is referenced in several verses throughout the Bible. One of the most well-known passages is found in the New Testament in the book of 1 Corinthians, chapter 15, verse 22, which states, "For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive." This verse speaks to the belief that just as all people experience physical death because of Adam's sin, all believers will be resurrected through Christ.

Another important passage on resurrection is found in the Gospel of John, chapter 11, verses 25-26, where Jesus says to Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die." This verse emphasizes the idea that belief in Jesus guarantees eternal life and resurrection.

Additionally, the book of Daniel in the Old Testament contains verses that speak to the concept of resurrection. In Daniel 12:2-3, it says, "Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever." These verses suggest a future resurrection for both the righteous and the wicked.

Overall, the concept of resurrection is a key theme in the Bible, with various verses addressing different aspects of this belief.
