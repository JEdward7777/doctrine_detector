  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of resurrection in the Christian worldview. They accurately identify and interpret relevant verses from both the Old and New Testaments, linking them to the central belief of resurrection in Christianity. The response is well-organized and clearly articulates the significance of the concept of resurrection for Christian doctrine. However, including the suggested verses from the teacher would have elevated the grade further."
