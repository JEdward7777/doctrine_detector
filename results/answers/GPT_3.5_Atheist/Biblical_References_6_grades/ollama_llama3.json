The passage from 1 Corinthians 15:22 is particularly relevant to the idea that Christ's death and resurrection are the means by which believers will be made alive. Additionally, the reference to Jesus' statement about being the \"resurrection and the life\" in John 11:25-26 emphasizes the connection between faith in Jesus and eternal life.\n\nThe response also acknowledges the importance of focusing on scripture as a foundation for Christian beliefs and teachings, highlighting relevant passages such as Daniel 12:2-3. The mention of various verses that address different aspects of resurrection, including both Old Testament (Daniel) and New Testament (1 Corinthians, John), is a strength.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more explicit connections between the scriptural references and the concept of resurrection, as well as a clearer explanation of how these passages relate to each other. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the importance of focusing on scripture, it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or further elaboration on this point.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical basis for the concept of resurrection and an appreciation for the importance of scriptural references in grounding Christian beliefs and teachings."
