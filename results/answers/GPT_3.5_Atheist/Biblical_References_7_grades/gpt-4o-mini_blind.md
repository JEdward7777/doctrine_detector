## [Answer](../Biblical_References_7.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly! In the Christian Bible, there are several references that highlight the significance of the Sabbath:

1. Exodus 20:8-11 - The Fourth Commandment states, "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work... For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."

2. Mark 2:27-28 - Jesus said, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."

3. Colossians 2:16-17 - The Apostle Paul wrote, "Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ."

These verses emphasize the importance of honoring the Sabbath day as a day of rest and reflection, as well as highlighting the freedom found in Jesus regarding observance of the Sabbath.
