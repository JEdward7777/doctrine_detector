  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible references that highlight the significance of the Sabbath in the Christian faith, such as Exodus 20:8-11, Mark 2:27-28, and Colossians 2:16-17. However, they missed key references identified by the teacher, such as Exodus 31:14 and Isaiah 56:6-7, which specifically discuss the command to observe the Sabbath. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of Sabbath observance but could have strengthened their answer by including the additional references provided in the reference answer."
