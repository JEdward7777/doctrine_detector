The inclusion of Exodus 20:8-11, Mark 2:27-28, and Colossians 2:16-17 effectively supports the importance of honoring the Sabbath day. The response could have been further improved by elaborating on the connection between the Old Testament laws regarding Sabbath observance and Jesus' teachings on the Sabbath in the New Testament."
