The student accurately cites verses such as Mark 10:45, 1 Timothy 2:6, and Matthew 20:28, which indeed contribute to the understanding of redemption through Jesus Christ's sacrificial act of giving His life as a ransom for many. The explanation of how the concept of ransom highlights liberation from bondage and the payment of a price for sin is clear and aligns well with Christian doctrine. Great job overall!"
