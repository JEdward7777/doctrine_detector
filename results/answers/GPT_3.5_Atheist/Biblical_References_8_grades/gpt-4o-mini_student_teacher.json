  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses that reference the concept of ransom and attempted to explain how they contribute to understanding redemption. However, the student's answer lacks depth in connecting the verses to the theme of deliverance and God's initiative in redemption as emphasized in the reference answer from the teacher. A more thorough analysis and theological reflection on the significance of these verses in the context of redemption would have improved the response."
