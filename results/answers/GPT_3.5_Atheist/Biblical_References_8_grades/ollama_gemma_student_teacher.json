The student provides clear examples from Mark 10:45, 1 Timothy 2:6, and Matthew 20:28 to support their claims. Additionally, the student correctly highlights the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death as the payment for sin and the idea of liberation from bondage through redemption. The inclusion of the concept of ransom as a means of paying the price for sin aligns with the Christian worldview that redemption is a gift from God that requires a sacrifice."
