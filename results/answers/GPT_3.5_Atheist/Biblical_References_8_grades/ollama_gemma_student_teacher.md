## [Answer](../Biblical_References_8.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of ransom is referenced in several Bible verses, including:

1. Mark 10:45 - "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." This verse emphasizes the idea that Jesus gave his life as a ransom to redeem many.

2. 1 Timothy 2:6 - "Who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time." Here, it is stated that Jesus gave himself as a ransom for all people, highlighting the universal scope of redemption.

3. Matthew 20:28 - "Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." This verse reiterates the message that Jesus gave his life as a ransom for many.

These verses contribute to the understanding of redemption by emphasizing the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death as a means of paying the price for sin and reconciling humanity with God. The concept of ransom highlights the idea of liberation from bondage and captivity through the payment of a price, underscoring the notion of redemption as a process of rescue and deliverance from sin and its consequences.
