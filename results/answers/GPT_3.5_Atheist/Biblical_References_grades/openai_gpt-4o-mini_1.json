However, the response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the specified concern and explaining how Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18 specifically illustrate the concept of covenant faithfulness in the Bible. More detailed analysis and connection between the verses and the understanding of covenant faithfulness would have enhanced the response further."
