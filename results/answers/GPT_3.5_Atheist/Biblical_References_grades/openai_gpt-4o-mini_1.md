## [Answer](../Biblical_References.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
While as an atheistic scholar I do not believe in the divine inspiration of the Bible, I can provide information on the concept of covenant faithfulness as it relates to biblical texts. In the Christian tradition, covenant faithfulness refers to God's faithfulness to the covenants made with his people, such as the Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants.

Some Bible verses that are related to covenant faithfulness include:

1. Deuteronomy 7:9 - "Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations."

2. Psalm 33:4 - "For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness."

3. Hebrews 10:23 - "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful."

These verses emphasize the idea of God's unwavering commitment to keeping his promises and remaining faithful to his people throughout generations.
