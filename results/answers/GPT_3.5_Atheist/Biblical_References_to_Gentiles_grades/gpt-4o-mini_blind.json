The answer could be improved by discussing the specific details in these passages that support this inclusion, such as the conversion of Saul (Paul) in Acts 9 and Paul's assertion in Galatians 2:16 that justification comes through faith in Christ. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Gentile inclusion, such as the fulfillment of God's promise to bless all nations through Abraham. A more thorough explanation with specific textual references would enhance the overall analysis."
