  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid answer that demonstrates an understanding of the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith as revealed in Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16. The student correctly notes the importance of faith in Jesus for Gentiles and highlights the departure from previous exclusivity towards a more inclusive message. However, the student could have delved deeper into the specific teachings on grace and inclusion present in these passages to align more closely with the concern provided."
