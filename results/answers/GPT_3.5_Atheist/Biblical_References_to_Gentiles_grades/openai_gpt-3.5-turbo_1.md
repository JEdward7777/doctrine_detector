Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 reveal that the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith was a significant development in the early Christian community. These passages highlight the understanding that through faith in Christ, all people, regardless of their background or ethnicity, are welcomed into the Christian community. This inclusivity was a departure from the exclusivity of certain Jewish religious beliefs at the time, and it reflected a more expansive and universal message of salvation through Christ.
