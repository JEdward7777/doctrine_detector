However, the inclusion of the atheistic perspective and framing it as equally valid detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the answer. In a Christian worldview, heaven is not considered a mere human construct, but a real and promised realm by God for believers. The answer could have been stronger by presenting a more robust explanation from a Christian theological standpoint without giving equal weight to opposing views."
