  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of heaven from a Christian perspective. \n\nThe student provides a comprehensive overview of relevant Bible verses, including Revelation 21:4, John 14:2-3, and 1 Corinthians 2:9, and explains their significance in relation to the idea of heaven. \n\nThe student also acknowledges the diversity of interpretations among Christian denominations and scholars, demonstrating an awareness of differing perspectives. \n\nAdditionally, the student's recognition of the cultural significance of these beliefs is commendable. \n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from including more specific references to the key verses suggested by the teacher, which would strengthen the student's demonstration of knowledge of the biblical text."
