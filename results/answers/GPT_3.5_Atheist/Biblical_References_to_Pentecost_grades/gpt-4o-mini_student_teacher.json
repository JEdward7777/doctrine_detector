  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided an informative answer that accurately mentioned references to the Festival of Weeks in the Bible and its significance in Jewish tradition. However, the answer did not specifically address the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost as requested. It would have been more appropriate for the student to include references to the New Testament book of Acts, which directly connects the Festival of Weeks with the Christian observance of Pentecost."
