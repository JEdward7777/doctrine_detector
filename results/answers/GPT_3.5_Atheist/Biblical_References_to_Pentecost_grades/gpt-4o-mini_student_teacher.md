## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot in Jewish tradition, is referenced in the Bible in the book of Exodus 34:22, Deuteronomy 16:10, and Leviticus 23:15-22. This festival is a harvest festival that also commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Festival of Weeks is significant in that it marks the culmination of the seven-week counting period between Passover and Shavuot, and is a time for the Jewish people to celebrate and give thanks for the blessings of the harvest and the gift of the Torah.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided an informative answer that accurately mentioned references to the Festival of Weeks in the Bible and its significance in Jewish tradition. However, the answer did not specifically address the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost as requested. It would have been more appropriate for the student to include references to the New Testament book of Acts, which directly connects the Festival of Weeks with the Christian observance of Pentecost.
