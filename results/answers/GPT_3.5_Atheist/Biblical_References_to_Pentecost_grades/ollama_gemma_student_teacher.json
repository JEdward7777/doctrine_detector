It also provides a concise explanation of the festival's significance as a harvest festival and a commemoration of the giving of the Torah. However, the answer could benefit from including additional references to other relevant biblical passages, such as 2 Chronicles, Numbers, and Acts, as mentioned in the reference answer."
