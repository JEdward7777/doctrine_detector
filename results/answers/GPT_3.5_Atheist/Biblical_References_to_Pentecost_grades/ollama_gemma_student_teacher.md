## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot in Jewish tradition, is referenced in the Bible in the book of Exodus 34:22, Deuteronomy 16:10, and Leviticus 23:15-22. This festival is a harvest festival that also commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Festival of Weeks is significant in that it marks the culmination of the seven-week counting period between Passover and Shavuot, and is a time for the Jewish people to celebrate and give thanks for the blessings of the harvest and the gift of the Torah.
