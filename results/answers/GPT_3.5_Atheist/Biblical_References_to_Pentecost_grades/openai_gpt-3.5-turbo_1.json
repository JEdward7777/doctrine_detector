However, the mention of Acts in the answer is not relevant to the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost from a Christian perspective. The response could have further delved into the specific scriptural connections between Pentecost and the Festival of Weeks as observed by Christians, showing a deeper understanding of the topic."
