However, the concern was specifically about the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost, and the response does not directly address Pentecost as recorded in the book of Acts, which is the Christian perspective on this festival. More explicit reference to Acts 2 where the events of Pentecost are described would have made the answer more complete and aligned with the Christian worldview."
