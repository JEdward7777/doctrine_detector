## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot in Jewish tradition, is referenced in the Bible in the book of Exodus 34:22, Deuteronomy 16:10, and Leviticus 23:15-22. This festival is a harvest festival that also commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Festival of Weeks is significant in that it marks the culmination of the seven-week counting period between Passover and Shavuot, and is a time for the Jewish people to celebrate and give thanks for the blessings of the harvest and the gift of the Torah.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides accurate information about the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot) and correctly references the books of Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Leviticus where it is mentioned in the Bible. However, the concern was specifically about the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost, and the response does not directly address Pentecost as recorded in the book of Acts, which is the Christian perspective on this festival. More explicit reference to Acts 2 where the events of Pentecost are described would have made the answer more complete and aligned with the Christian worldview.
