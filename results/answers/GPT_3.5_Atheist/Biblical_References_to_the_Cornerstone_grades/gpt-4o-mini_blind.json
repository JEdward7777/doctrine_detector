The student effectively conveys the importance of Jesus as the central figure in the Christian faith, emphasizing His role in providing stability, unity, and trust for believers. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into the theological significance of Jesus as the cornerstone, perhaps by discussing how He is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the cornerstone upon which the entire gospel message stands."
