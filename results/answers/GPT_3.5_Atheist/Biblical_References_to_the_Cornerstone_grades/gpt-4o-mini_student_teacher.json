  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer by referencing key verses that mention Jesus as the cornerstone and explaining the significance of His role in the Christian faith. They effectively conveyed how Jesus provides stability, unity, and trust for believers. However, the student missed mentioning important verses like Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22, which are specifically highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to dive deeper into scripture to fully grasp the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone would further enhance their understanding."
