The concept of Jesus as the cornerstone is referenced in several verses in the Bible, particularly in the New Testament. One such reference is Ephesians 2:20, which states, "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone." This verse conveys the idea that Jesus is the central and most important element of the Christian faith, providing stability and unity to the church.

Another reference can be found in 1 Peter 2:6, which says, "For in Scripture, it says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.'" This verse emphasizes Jesus' significance as the chosen and precious cornerstone upon which believers can place their trust and find security.

Overall, the verses highlighting Jesus as the cornerstone emphasize His foundational role in the Christian faith, serving as the source of unity, stability, and trust for believers. Just as a cornerstone is essential for the construction of a building, Jesus is essential for the spiritual foundation and growth of the church.
