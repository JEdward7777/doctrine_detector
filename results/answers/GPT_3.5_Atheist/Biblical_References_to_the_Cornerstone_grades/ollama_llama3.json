  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides some relevant biblical references that highlight Jesus' role as the cornerstone, which aligns with the concern to encourage believers to explore scripture and deepen their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith. The examples from Ephesians 2:20 and 1 Peter 2:6 are particularly strong, as they provide a clear explanation of Jesus' foundational role in the Christian faith.\n\nHowever, I would give it an 85 rather than a perfect score because the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its exploration of scripture. While the references provided are relevant, they are somewhat superficially presented without much depth or analysis. Additionally, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between Jesus' role as the cornerstone and the believer's experience of faith.\n\nOverall, the response is a good start, but it could be even stronger with more development and analysis of the biblical references provided."
