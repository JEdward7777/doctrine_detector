## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Hebrew Bible, specifically in the Old Testament, references the temple as the "house of Yahweh" in several scriptures. One notable example is in the Second Book of Chronicles 3:1, which states, "Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite." This verse highlights the temple in Jerusalem as the designated house of Yahweh, built by King Solomon.
