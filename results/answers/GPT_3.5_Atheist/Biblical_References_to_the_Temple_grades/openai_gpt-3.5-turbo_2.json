  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively identifies key scriptures (1 Kings 8:44, 2 Chronicles 6:4) that discuss the concept of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh.\" The additional mention of other verses in the content supports the understanding of the temple's significance in relation to God's house. The only improvement could be providing specific references to those \"other verses\" for a more comprehensive understanding."
