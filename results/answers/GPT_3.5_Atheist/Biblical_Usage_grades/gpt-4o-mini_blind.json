However, from a Christian perspective, it would be important to highlight the theological significance of these genealogies, such as tracing the promise of the Messiah through the generations and showcasing God's faithfulness in fulfilling His covenant promises. Additionally, connecting the genealogies to broader theological themes of redemption and salvation would have strengthened the answer."
