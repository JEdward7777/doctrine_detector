The explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the biblical context. However, it could have been strengthened by including specific examples of \"woe\" pronouncements in the Bible and delving deeper into the theological implications of God's judgment. Additionally, tying in the concept of repentance and salvation more explicitly would have enhanced the response."
