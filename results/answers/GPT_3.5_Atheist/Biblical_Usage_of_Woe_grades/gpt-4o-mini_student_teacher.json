  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of how the term \"woe\" is used in the Bible to convey divine judgment. The explanation effectively ties the concept of divine judgment to God's justice and righteousness, emphasizing the serious consequences of straying from His will. The student could have slightly enhanced their response by incorporating specific biblical references like the ones mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
