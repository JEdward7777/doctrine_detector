  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the concept of \"woe\" in the Bible, highlighting its connection to judgment and warning from God. The explanation of how \"woe\" is used as a pronouncement against those who act contrary to God's will is also accurate and well-articulated. Additionally, the discussion on God's stance on justice and righteousness is relevant and supports the concern about examining the seriousness of divine judgment.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples from scripture to support its claims. While it mentions a few instances where \"woe\" is used, it would have been helpful to include more examples to demonstrate the severity of divine judgment. The given answer provides some good examples that the response does not mention, such as Ezekiel 13:17-18 and Habakkuk 2:12, which could have been incorporated into the discussion.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of \"woe\" in scripture and its connection to divine judgment. With more specific examples and further development of the discussion, it could be even stronger."
