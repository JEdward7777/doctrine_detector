  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed description of the materials commonly used for constructing altars during biblical times, the reference answer specified that altars were often made from packed dirt or large stones, which differed slightly from the student's answer. However, the student accurately highlighted the significance of the materials chosen for their durability and symbolic importance. Further alignment with the specific materials outlined in the reference answer would have strengthened the response."
