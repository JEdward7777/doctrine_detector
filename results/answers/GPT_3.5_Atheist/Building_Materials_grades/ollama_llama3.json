  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides some accurate information about the materials used to construct altars during biblical times, including stone, wood, and metal. However, it falls short in terms of providing a more comprehensive understanding of altar construction. For example, the response does not mention the common practice of stacking stones to create a solid structure, nor does it provide any specific examples of metals used for decorative purposes or symbolic significance.\n\nFurthermore, while the response mentions the use of wood and metal, it does not explicitly state that stone was a particularly prevalent material used in altar construction. This oversight limits the potential for deeper understanding of biblical practices and reverence associated with worship, as mentioned in the concern.\n\nTo improve the grade, I would suggest providing more specific examples and details about altar construction, including the materials used and their symbolic significance."
