# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
During biblical times, altars were commonly constructed using natural materials such as stone, wood, and sometimes metal. Stone altars were particularly prevalent and were often made by stacking stones on top of each other to create a solid structure. Wood was also used for altars, but it was less common due to its flammability. In some cases, altars were overlaid with metal such as bronze or gold for decorative purposes or to symbolize the importance of the altar. These materials were chosen not only for their durability and availability but also for their symbolic significance in religious rituals and ceremonies.

Comment: The response accurately mentions that altars were sometimes constructed from wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze, which aligns with the original response. While the mention of altars made from packed dirt is not as common based on biblical accounts, the understanding of the materials used and their significance in religious practices shows a good grasp of the topic. The response could have elaborated more on the symbolic significance of these materials in Christian worship practices to further deepen the understanding of the connection between altars and biblical reverence.
