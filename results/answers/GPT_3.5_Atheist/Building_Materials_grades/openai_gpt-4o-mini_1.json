  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provided a good overview of the materials used in constructing altars during biblical times, particularly focusing on the use of packed dirt, large stones, wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze. However, the response lacked detail about the significance and symbolism of these materials in religious rituals and ceremonies, which is essential for deepening a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and reverence associated with worship. Adding more depth and explanation to the significance of the materials used would have enhanced the overall response."
