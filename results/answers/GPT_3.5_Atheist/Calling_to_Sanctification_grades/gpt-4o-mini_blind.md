## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of personal sanctification is rooted in religious beliefs and practices. However, it can be understood as a way for individuals to strive for moral and ethical development. In a secular context, the "command" for individuals to work towards personal growth and improvement can come from various sources such as societal norms, ethical principles, personal values, and scientific understanding of human behavior. Ultimately, each individual has the autonomy to determine their own path towards personal development and betterment without the need for external divine commands.

Comment: The response completely misses the Christian perspective on personal sanctification, which is rooted in the belief that believers are called by God to continuously grow in holiness and righteousness through obedience to His commandments and reliance on His grace. The answer dismisses the concept of divine command and fails to address the specific biblical instructions given to believers regarding personal sanctification. The atheistic perspective presented contradicts fundamental Christian beliefs on the source and nature of personal growth and moral development.
