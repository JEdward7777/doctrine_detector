  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer takes a purely secular and atheistic perspective on the concept of personal sanctification, failing to address the Christian worldview and the specific command given to believers in Jesus. Their response neglects the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process as emphasized in the Christian faith. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating a discussion on how Christians are called to sanctify themselves to God and the role of personal responsibility in that process."
