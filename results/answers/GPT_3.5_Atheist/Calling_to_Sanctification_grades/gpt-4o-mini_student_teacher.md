## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of personal sanctification is rooted in religious beliefs and practices. However, it can be understood as a way for individuals to strive for moral and ethical development. In a secular context, the "command" for individuals to work towards personal growth and improvement can come from various sources such as societal norms, ethical principles, personal values, and scientific understanding of human behavior. Ultimately, each individual has the autonomy to determine their own path towards personal development and betterment without the need for external divine commands.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer takes a purely secular and atheistic perspective on the concept of personal sanctification, failing to address the Christian worldview and the specific command given to believers in Jesus. Their response neglects the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process as emphasized in the Christian faith. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating a discussion on how Christians are called to sanctify themselves to God and the role of personal responsibility in that process.
