  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 70/100\n\n**Comment:** While the student's answer demonstrates an understanding of the importance of personal growth and ethical development, it fails to address the Christian-specific worldview concern of the prompt. The response avoids taking a position on the specific command given to believers in Jesus regarding personal sanctification. It would have strengthened the answer to engage with the provided reference answer and explicitly connect the concept of sanctification to Christian faith and practices."
