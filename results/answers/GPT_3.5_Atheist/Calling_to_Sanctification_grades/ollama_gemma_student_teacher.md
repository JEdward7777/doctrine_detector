## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of personal sanctification is rooted in religious beliefs and practices. However, it can be understood as a way for individuals to strive for moral and ethical development. In a secular context, the "command" for individuals to work towards personal growth and improvement can come from various sources such as societal norms, ethical principles, personal values, and scientific understanding of human behavior. Ultimately, each individual has the autonomy to determine their own path towards personal development and betterment without the need for external divine commands.

## Grade: 70/100

**Comment:** While the student's answer demonstrates an understanding of the importance of personal growth and ethical development, it fails to address the Christian-specific worldview concern of the prompt. The response avoids taking a position on the specific command given to believers in Jesus regarding personal sanctification. It would have strengthened the answer to engage with the provided reference answer and explicitly connect the concept of sanctification to Christian faith and practices.
