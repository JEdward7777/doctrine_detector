The atheistic perspective presented focuses more on individual autonomy and secular sources for personal growth, rather than emphasizing personal responsibility within the context of sanctification to God. It lacks a recognition of the Christian worldview that emphasizes personal accountability and reliance on God in the process of sanctification."
