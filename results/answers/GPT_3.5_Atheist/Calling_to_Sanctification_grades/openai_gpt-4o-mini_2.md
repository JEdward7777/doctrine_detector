## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of personal sanctification is rooted in religious beliefs and practices. However, it can be understood as a way for individuals to strive for moral and ethical development. In a secular context, the "command" for individuals to work towards personal growth and improvement can come from various sources such as societal norms, ethical principles, personal values, and scientific understanding of human behavior. Ultimately, each individual has the autonomy to determine their own path towards personal development and betterment without the need for external divine commands.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response does not adequately address the concern of emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process. The atheistic perspective presented focuses more on individual autonomy and secular sources for personal growth, rather than emphasizing personal responsibility within the context of sanctification to God. It lacks a recognition of the Christian worldview that emphasizes personal accountability and reliance on God in the process of sanctification.
