  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student effectively explains the interaction between the centurion and Jesus in relation to faith and authority. They correctly point out the centurion's great faith and recognition of Jesus' authority. The discussion on faith as a personal belief in divine power and authority coming from humility is appropriate. However, the response could be strengthened with specific references to scriptures such as Matthew 8:5-13 where this interaction is found, and by delving deeper into the theological implications of the centurion's faith and Jesus' authority in the Christian worldview."
