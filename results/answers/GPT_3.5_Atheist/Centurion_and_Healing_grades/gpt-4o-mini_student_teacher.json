  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus regarding faith and authority. They accurately highlighted the centurion's faith in Jesus' authority to heal without physical presence. The student's response effectively tied faith and authority together in the context of Jesus' ministry. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused on the specific concern provided."
