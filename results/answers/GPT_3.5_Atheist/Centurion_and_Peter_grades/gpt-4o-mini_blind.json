The student correctly emphasizes God's inclusive love for all people and the universal reach of the Gospel message. The mention of Peter's initial hesitation and the vision from God adds depth to the explanation. However, the response could have further emphasized the doctrinal aspect of how Jesus' death and resurrection opened the door for all nations to come to faith in Him, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. Additionally, drawing connections to the early Church's understanding of the Gentiles' inclusion through Christ would have strengthened the doctrinal foundation of the argument."
