  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as an 80. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the hierarchical structure between the chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Jewish society, accurately highlighting the chief priests as holding higher positions of authority. However, the student's answer provides more detail on the roles and responsibilities of both groups, which adds depth to their explanation. The reference answer is more concise and straightforward, focusing primarily on the hierarchy of authority. Overall, the student's response is comprehensive and well-supported, earning a solid grade."
