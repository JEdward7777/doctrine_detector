## [Answer](../Chief_Priests__Authority.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The relationship between the chief priests and the ordinary priests in ancient Jewish society was hierarchical in nature. The chief priests held higher positions of authority and were responsible for overseeing the religious affairs of the community, including important rituals and ceremonies. They were typically from prominent priestly families and often had connections to the ruling elite.

Ordinary priests, on the other hand, served under the supervision of the chief priests and carried out more routine tasks, such as assisting with sacrifices and maintaining the temple. They did not hold the same level of power or influence as the chief priests and were seen as subordinate to them within the religious hierarchy.

Overall, the chief priests wielded greater authority and were viewed as the spiritual leaders of the community, while the ordinary priests played a more supportive role in carrying out the day-to-day religious duties.
