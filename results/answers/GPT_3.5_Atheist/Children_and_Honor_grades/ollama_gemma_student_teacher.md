## [Answer](../Children_and_Honor.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Bible instructs children to honor their parents in various passages, including the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:12, which states, "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you." In Ephesians 6:2-3, it is reiterated, "‘Honor your father and mother’—which is the first commandment with a promise—‘so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.’"

The concept of honoring one's parents is seen as an important moral and ethical duty in many cultures and religions, not just in Christianity. It is a way to show respect, gratitude, and care for those who brought us into the world and raised us. Honoring parents can include obeying their guidance (when it is positive and beneficial), showing appreciation and love, providing care and support as they age, and treating them with respect and dignity.
