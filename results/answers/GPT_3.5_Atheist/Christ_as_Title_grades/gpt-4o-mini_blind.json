They have explained the transition from a simple translation of \"Messiah\" to a title associated with Jesus, emphasizing his role as the fulfillment of messianic prophecies and his divinity. The response could benefit from mentioning the significance of the term \"Christ\" in Greek as \"the Anointed One,\" which carries deep theological implications in Christian doctrine. Additionally, a stronger connection to specific biblical verses or passages that illustrate this evolution would enhance the answer."
