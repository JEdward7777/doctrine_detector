  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student made a thoughtful attempt to provide suggestions for modern Christians to reflect the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness, their answer falls short of specifically addressing key practices such as repentance, confession, and spiritual discipline. The response primarily focuses on general spiritual practices and lacks the depth and specificity required to fully align with the concern provided. In order to improve, the student should incorporate more direct references to biblical teachings and emphasize the importance of repentance and confession as integral components of ritual cleanliness in the Old Testament context."
