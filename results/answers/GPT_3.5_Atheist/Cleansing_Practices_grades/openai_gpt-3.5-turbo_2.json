The focus on cultural and historical perspectives overlooks the foundational belief in the authority and inspiration of the Old Testament scriptures within Christianity. Additionally, the suggestions provided do not emphasize the centrality of Christ's redemptive work in achieving spiritual cleanliness, which is crucial in a Christian understanding of ritual purity."
