  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of what it means to have a 'clear conscience' in the context of Christian teachings. The student correctly highlights the importance of aligning one's actions with the teachings of Christianity, seeking forgiveness for sins, and striving to lead a virtuous life. The explanation is clear and well-supported with relevant information. However, it could have been strengthened by including specific references to biblical passages or teachings that emphasize the concept of a clear conscience."
