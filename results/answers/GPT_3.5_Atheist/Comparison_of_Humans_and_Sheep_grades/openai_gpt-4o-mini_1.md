In the context of biblical teaching, the comparison between humans and sheep signifies several things. Sheep are often used as a metaphor for human beings in the Bible to highlight our inherent vulnerability, tendency to stray or wander off the righteous path, and our need for guidance and protection. Just as a shepherd cares for and leads his flock, God is portrayed as our shepherd who watches over us, guides us, and protects us from harm.
