  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written and thoughtful response, highlighting the biblical definition of compassion and the actions associated with it effectively. They have appropriately emphasized the importance of compassion in Christian teachings and how it reflects the love and grace of God towards others. However, the student's answer could have closely aligned with the reference answer by emphasizing that compassion involves not only feeling concern but also taking tangible actions to help those in need."
