  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a relevant example of compassion from the Bible with the story of the Good Samaritan, showcasing the importance of helping others in need regardless of background. However, the student could have further enriched their answer by including additional examples such as Daniel's refusal to defile himself, Hosea's love for an unfaithful spouse, and Jesus healing the sick, to demonstrate a broader understanding of compassion as modeled by biblical figures."
