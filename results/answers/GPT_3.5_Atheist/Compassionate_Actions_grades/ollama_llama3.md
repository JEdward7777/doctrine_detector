Examples include Daniel's refusal to defile himself, Hosea's love for an unfaithful spouse, and Jesus healing the sick.

Recognizing real-life applications of compassion as modeled by biblical figures.

## [Answer](../Compassionate_Actions.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, there are numerous instances where individuals demonstrated compassion. One notable example is the story of the Good Samaritan in the New Testament. In this parable told by Jesus, a man is beaten and left for dead on the side of the road. Several people pass by the injured man, including a priest and a Levite, without offering help. However, a Samaritan, who was traditionally an enemy of the Jews, stops to assist the man. He tends to his wounds, takes him to an inn, and even pays for his care. This story illustrates the importance of showing compassion and helping those in need, regardless of race or background.
