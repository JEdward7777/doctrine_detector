However, the response could improve by explicitly connecting these teachings to the perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation. It would be more doctrinally accurate to emphasize that while mercy and redemption are vital components, they do not negate the reality of God's justice and the consequences of sin. Highlighting the importance of repentance, accountability, and the redemptive work of Christ in relation to punishment would strengthen the overall argument."
