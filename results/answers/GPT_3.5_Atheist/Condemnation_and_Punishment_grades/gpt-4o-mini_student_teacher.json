  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80. The student effectively explains how the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 shape our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation by emphasizing mercy, redemption, and seeking refuge in God. They provide a clear interpretation of the verses and their implications on our understanding of punishment. However, the student could have further connected the teachings to the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in punishment, which would have strengthened their answer."
