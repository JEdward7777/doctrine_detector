  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively integrates the teachings from Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 to emphasize the importance of mercy in our interactions and the assurance of protection for those who seek refuge in God. The connection made to divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment is well articulated, showing a good balance between the two concepts. The response could have been slightly improved by providing more specific examples or illustrations to further enhance the understanding of how these teachings apply to the balance of divine justice and mercy in punishment. Overall, a strong and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview."
