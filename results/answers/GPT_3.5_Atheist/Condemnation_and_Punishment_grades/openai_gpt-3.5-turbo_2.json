It accurately emphasizes the balance between divine justice and mercy by showcasing God's value of mercy over sacrifice and the promise of protection for the innocent. The response could further deepen the analysis by exploring how these teachings inform the Christian perspective on justice and punishment in a more nuanced manner."
