## [Answer](../Condemnation_and_Punishment.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Matthew 12:7, Jesus rebukes the Pharisees, saying, "If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent." This verse emphasizes the importance of mercy over harsh judgment and condemnation. It suggests that understanding and embodying mercy is crucial in our interactions with others, especially when it comes to passing judgment or punishment.

Similarly, Psalm 34:22 states, "The Lord redeems his servants; no one will be condemned who takes refuge in him." This verse highlights the idea of seeking refuge in God as a way to avoid condemnation. It conveys the belief that those who trust in God will be redeemed and protected from unjust condemnation.

These teachings shape our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation by emphasizing the importance of mercy, redemption, and seeking refuge in God. They suggest that harsh judgment and condemnation should be avoided, and instead, a more merciful and redemptive approach should be taken. This perspective encourages us to consider the humanity of others, show compassion, and offer chances for rehabilitation rather than solely focusing on punitive measures.
