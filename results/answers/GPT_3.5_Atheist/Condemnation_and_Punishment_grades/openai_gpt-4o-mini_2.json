  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively incorporates the teachings from Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 to emphasize the importance of mercy and seeking refuge in God to avoid unjust condemnation. It also addresses the concern by highlighting the balance between divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. The only area for improvement could be providing a more explicit connection between the concepts of divine justice and mercy within the context of punishment."
