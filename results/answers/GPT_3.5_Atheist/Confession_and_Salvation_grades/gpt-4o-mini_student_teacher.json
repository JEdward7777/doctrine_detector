  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the relationship between confessing that Jesus is Lord and being saved according to Paul's writings. They correctly referenced Romans 10:9-10 and highlighted the importance of these beliefs within Christian theology. The student's response demonstrated a good understanding of the theological implications of confession and belief in salvation, although they did include an unnecessary tangent about atheistic perspectives. Overall, a strong and well-written answer."
