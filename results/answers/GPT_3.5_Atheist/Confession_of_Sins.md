According to the Bible, Christians who are tempted to sin should resist temptation and turn to prayer for strength and guidance. In 1 Corinthians 10:13, it is written, "No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it." This verse highlights the belief that God will always provide a way for believers to resist temptation and overcome sin.

Additionally, in James 4:7-8, it is stated, "Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come near to God and he will come near to you." This passage emphasizes the importance of drawing closer to God through prayer and seeking His help in times of temptation.

Ultimately, the Bible teaches that Christians should rely on God's strength and guidance to resist temptation and live a life that is pleasing to Him.
