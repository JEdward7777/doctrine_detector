  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a solid response citing relevant Bible verses on resisting temptation and relying on God's strength. However, the answer did not directly address the importance of acknowledging personal sin and seeking God's forgiveness in relation to overcoming temptation. Encouraging the student to incorporate the element of confession and seeking forgiveness into their explanation would have strengthened their response from a Christian perspective."
