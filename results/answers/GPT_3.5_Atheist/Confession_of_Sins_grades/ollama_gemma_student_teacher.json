  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness. The student correctly cites relevant biblical passages (1 Corinthians 10:13 and James 4:7-8) to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from a clearer explanation of the need for confession as a means of seeking God's forgiveness and strength in resisting temptation."
