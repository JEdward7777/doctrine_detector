However, there was a lack of emphasis on the specific aspect of confessing personal sins in relation to seeking God's forgiveness, which was the main concern provided. Encouraging a clearer connection between acknowledging personal sin and seeking forgiveness in the context of resisting temptation would have made the response more comprehensive from a Christian worldview perspective."
