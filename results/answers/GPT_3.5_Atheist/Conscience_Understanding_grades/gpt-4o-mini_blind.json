It accurately discusses the role of conscience as an inner sense of right and wrong shaped by God's moral law. The references to relevant biblical passages, such as Romans 2:15, add depth to the response. The emphasis on the importance of a well-formed conscience and the need to align it with the teachings of the Church is also commendable. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the concept of conscience being rooted in the image of God within humanity and the idea of conscience being clouded by sin. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding and convicting believers through their conscience would have strengthened the theological aspect of the response."
