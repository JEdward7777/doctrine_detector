  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 90.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and well-informed answer on the biblical definition of conscience and how it functions according to Christian beliefs. They have correctly highlighted the role of conscience as an inner sense of right and wrong shaped by God's moral law and teachings, referencing relevant biblical passages such as Romans 2:15. The response also emphasizes the importance of a well-formed conscience in Christian morality and the need for guidance from religious authorities.\n\nThe only minor point of improvement could be to further emphasize the direct role of God in shaping and guiding the conscience, in alignment with the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and effectively addressed the concern provided."
