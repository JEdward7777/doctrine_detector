**Comments:**

The student's answer adequately identifies several individuals from the Bible who were consecrated to God, providing concise summaries of their significance. However, it overlooks the broader categories of individuals mentioned in the reference answer, such as the priests and the people of Israel as a whole. Including these aspects would have strengthened the student's response from a theological perspective.
