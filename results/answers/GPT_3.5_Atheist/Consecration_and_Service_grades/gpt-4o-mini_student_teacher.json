  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of consecration from a cultural and practical perspective, but it lacks a specific focus on the purification aspect mentioned in the concern. The student did not address how the purification process is integral to consecration in preparing individuals or things for God's service. There is a need for a deeper exploration of the cleansing and making acceptable aspect emphasized in the teacher's reference answer."
