## [Answer](../Consequences_of_Pride.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Bible, as a culturally revered text, contains numerous passages that warn against the dangers of pride and extol the virtues of humility. Proverbs 16:18 famously states, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall," emphasizing the idea that arrogance and self-importance can lead to downfall. 

In contrast, humility is frequently praised in the Bible. Philippians 2:3-4 urges believers to "do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others." This highlights the importance of putting others before oneself and embodying a spirit of humility.

Overall, the Bible emphasizes that pride can lead to downfall and destruction, while humility is valued as a virtue that promotes selflessness and consideration for others.
