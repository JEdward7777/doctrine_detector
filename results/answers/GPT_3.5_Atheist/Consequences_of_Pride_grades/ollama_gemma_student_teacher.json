  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical teachings on pride and humility. They effectively cite relevant scriptures and explain the spiritual implications of both attitudes. The response is well-organized and articulates the contrasting effects of pride and humility with clarity. However, including a direct connection to the teacher's reference answer regarding God humbling the proud and lifting up the humble would strengthen the overall response."
