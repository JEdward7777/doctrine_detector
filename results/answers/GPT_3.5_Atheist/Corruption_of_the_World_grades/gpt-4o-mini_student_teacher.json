  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out response from an atheistic perspective, acknowledging the importance of examining behaviors that go against moral principles. However, from a Christian worldview, the focus should be on identifying influences that contradict biblical teachings specifically and promote sin, rather than generic moral principles. The student could have improved their answer by emphasizing the importance of aligning with biblical values and discerning influences that lead away from godly living."
