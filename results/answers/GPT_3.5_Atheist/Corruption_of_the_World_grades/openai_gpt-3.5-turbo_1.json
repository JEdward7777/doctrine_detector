However, as a Christian-specific worldview is being considered, the initial response provided by the atheistic scholar lacks acknowledgment of the ultimate source of moral standards, which Christians believe come from God and the Bible. Therefore, although the response offers valuable insight, it could be enhanced by explicitly emphasizing the foundational role of God's Word in identifying corrupt influences from a Christian perspective."
