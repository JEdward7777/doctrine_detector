However, as an atheistic scholar, the perspective lacks the recognition of the spiritual aspect and the need for Christians to discern and resist influences that may lead them away from godly living. A Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of relying on God's guidance and prayer in discerning and combating corrupt influences in the world."
