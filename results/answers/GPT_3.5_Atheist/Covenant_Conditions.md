## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, there are various examples of both conditional and unconditional covenants. 

One example of a conditional covenant is the covenant between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai, where God promised to bless and protect them if they obeyed His commandments and followed His laws. However, if they disobeyed Him and turned to idolatry, they would face consequences.

On the other hand, an example of an unconditional covenant is the covenant that God made with Abraham, where God promised to make him the father of a great nation and to bless all the nations of the earth through his descendants, regardless of Abraham's behavior. This covenant was based solely on God's faithfulness and not on any conditions that Abraham had to meet.

These examples highlight the different types of covenants found in the Bible and how they reflect God's relationship with His people in different ways.
