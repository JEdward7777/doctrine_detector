  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a generally accurate description of a covenant in a biblical context. They correctly explain that a covenant is a solemn agreement or contract between two parties, often God and His people, and mention important elements such as terms, promises, obligations, and consequences. The explanation effectively conveys the significance of covenants in the Bible. To improve, the student could have emphasized more explicitly that covenants are relational agreements with spiritual implications, highlighting the sacred nature of these agreements in the biblical narrative."
