  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of covenants in biblical contexts, highlighting the solemn nature of the agreement, the parties involved, and the significance of promises, obligations, and consequences. While the student's definition is slightly more detailed than the reference answer, it accurately captures the essence of biblical covenants. A higher grade could have been given if the student had emphasized the importance of fulfilling obligations in a covenant which is crucial in a Christian worldview."
