However, it could have delved deeper into the specific aspects of the covenant, such as the sacrificial system, the Ten Commandments, and the various covenants within the Old Testament. More detailed theological explanations would help strengthen the answer and provide a fuller understanding of the covenant relationship between God and Israel."
