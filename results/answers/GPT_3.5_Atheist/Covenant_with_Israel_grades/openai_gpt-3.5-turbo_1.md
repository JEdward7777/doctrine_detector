The covenant that God made with the people of Israel in the Old Testament was a mutual agreement between God and the Israelites, where God promised to protect and bless them if they followed his commandments and worshipped only him. This covenant was believed to be a sacred bond between God and his chosen people, outlining the terms of their relationship and responsibilities towards one another. In exchange for their faithfulness and obedience, the Israelites were promised prosperity, land, and protection from enemies.
