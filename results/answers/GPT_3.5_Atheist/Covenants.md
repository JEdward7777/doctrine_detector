The promises made in biblical covenants illustrate a perceived commitment on the part of God to His people throughout Scripture. From the Abrahamic covenant, promising land and descendants, to the Mosaic covenant, outlining laws and regulations, these agreements between God and various figures in the Bible are seen as evidence of God's supposed dedication and care for his chosen people.
