The language used to describe the covenants with terms like \"perceived commitment,\" \"supposed dedication,\" and \"culturally retributed lens\" does not accurately represent the biblical teachings. There is a need for a more solid theological foundation and a clearer articulation of the significance of covenants in demonstrating God's faithfulness and love towards His people."
