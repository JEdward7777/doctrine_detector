  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student adequately touches on the concept of God's commitment in biblical covenants but spends more time discussing varying interpretations and cultural perspectives rather than highlighting the continuity and fulfillment of God's promises throughout Scripture. The student's answer lacks depth and fails to address the concern provided, focusing more on a superficial analysis rather than delving into the overarching narrative of redemption in the Bible."
