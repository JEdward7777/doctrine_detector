  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 75.\n\nThe response does attempt to address the concern of recognizing the continuity of God's promises, highlighting how the biblical covenants illustrate God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture. It also acknowledges the importance of cultural context in interpreting these covenants. However, the response could be stronger in explicitly connecting the biblical covenants to the overarching narrative of redemption in the Bible.\n\nThe score is 75 because the response shows some understanding of the concern and attempts to address it, but could be more explicit and detailed in its discussion."
