However, the inclusion of the phrase \"supposed dedication and care\" and the mention of \"culturally retributed lens\" and \"certain atheistic perspectives\" may raise concerns about the lack of affirmation of the truth and authority of God's promises as revealed in the Bible. The response could have been stronger by clearly affirming the divine nature of these covenants and their role in illustrating God's redemptive plan throughout history."
