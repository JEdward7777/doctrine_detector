However, the response also introduces a relativistic perspective by suggesting that biblical covenants are viewed through a culturally relative lens, which may undermine the absolute truth of God's promises within a Christian worldview. It could benefit from a stronger affirmation of the divine nature of the covenants and their significance in reflecting God's character and plan for redemption."
