## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In ancient Jewish culture, there was a sense of exclusivity and separateness between Jews and Gentiles. This was evident in various cultural practices such as dietary restrictions, Sabbath observances, and circumcision, all of which were considered important markers of Jewish identity and set the Jewish people apart from the Gentiles.

These cultural practices had a significant impact on early Christian practices, particularly as Christianity emerged from within a Jewish context. The early Christians, many of whom were Jewish, grappled with the question of whether Gentile converts to Christianity should be required to adhere to Jewish cultural practices. This debate led to the decision at the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15) to free Gentile converts from the requirement of circumcision and other Jewish cultural practices in order to more effectively spread the message of Christianity to non-Jews.

Ultimately, this decision allowed Christianity to become a more inclusive and universal faith, welcoming people of all backgrounds and cultures, and breaking down traditional barriers between Jews and Gentiles. The early Christians sought to focus on the core ethical teachings of Jesus rather than cultural practices, leading to a more inclusive and diverse religious community that grew beyond the confines of Jewish cultural boundaries.
