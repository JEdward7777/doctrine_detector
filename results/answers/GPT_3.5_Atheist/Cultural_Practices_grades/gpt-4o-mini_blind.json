The connection between Jewish exclusivity and the development of a more inclusive Christianity is well-articulated. However, the response could benefit from incorporating more specific examples of Jewish cultural practices and their direct impact on early Christian beliefs and practices. Additionally, tying in Scriptural references or theological insights related to this topic would enhance the doctrinal depth of the answer."
