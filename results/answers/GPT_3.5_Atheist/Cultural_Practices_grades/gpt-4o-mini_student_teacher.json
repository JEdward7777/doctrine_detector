  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as an 85.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough explanation of how cultural practices related to the Jewish view of Gentiles impacted early Christian practices. They accurately discuss the sense of exclusivity and separateness between Jews and Gentiles, how this manifested in cultural practices, and the influence it had on early Christian debates and decisions. The reference to the Council of Jerusalem and the shift towards inclusivity in Christianity is well articulated.\n\nHowever, the student could have further emphasized the specific cultural practices that caused the initial barriers in the early church, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. They could have discussed the avoidance of eating with or associating with Gentiles in more detail to show a deeper understanding of the cultural dynamics at play. Strengthening this aspect would have made the response more comprehensive.\n\nOverall, the student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and effectively connected cultural norms to the development of early Christian practices."
