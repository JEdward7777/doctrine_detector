  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing how cultural norms, specifically the exclusivity between Jews and Gentiles in ancient Jewish culture, influenced early Christian practices. It highlights the importance of inclusivity and acceptance in the early church, particularly in the context of the debate over whether Gentile converts should adhere to Jewish cultural practices. The reference to the Council of Jerusalem and its decision to free Gentile converts from such requirements demonstrates a clear understanding of how cultural norms impacted the early Christian community. The response could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or references to support its points."
