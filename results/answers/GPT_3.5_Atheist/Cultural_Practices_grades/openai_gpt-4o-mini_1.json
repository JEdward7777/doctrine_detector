It effectively addresses the concern about how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices from a Christian worldview by highlighting the shift towards inclusivity rooted in the teachings of Jesus. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the role of Jesus' teachings in guiding this shift towards inclusivity."
