It correctly highlights the barriers that existed between Jews and Gentiles and the resulting debates within the early church. The connection between cultural practices and faith community development is well-analyzed within this Christian perspective. However, the response could further strengthen its Christian worldview by explicitly referencing relevant biblical principles or teachings that guide inclusivity and acceptance within the faith community."
