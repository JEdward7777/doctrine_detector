The mention of the consequences of sin, the idea of divine justice, and the connection to Jesus Christ's role in redemption are all relevant points. However, the explanation could be strengthened by delving deeper into the theological implications of the curse and its connection to the broader themes of the Bible, such as the Fall of Man and the promise of a Savior. Additionally, clarifying the specific Christian doctrine of original sin and how it relates to the curse on the snake would enhance the depth of the response."
