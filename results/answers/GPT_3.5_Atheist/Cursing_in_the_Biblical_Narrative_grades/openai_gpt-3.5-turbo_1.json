The student successfully addresses the concern by highlighting how the curse on the snake foreshadows the need for reconciliation and restoration, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ. However, there could have been more explicit references to key Christian theological concepts such as original sin and atonement to further strengthen the connection between the curse on the snake and the broader narrative of sin and redemption in scripture."
