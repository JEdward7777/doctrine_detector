# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Christian theology, the promise of David's throne lasting forever is often interpreted as representing the eternal kingship of Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies regarding a descendant of David who would establish an everlasting kingdom.

The New Testament presents Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah who is not only a descendant of David but also the Son of God. Through his death and resurrection, Jesus established a spiritual kingdom that transcends earthly kingdoms and will last for all eternity. This spiritual kingdom is believed to be open to all believers, regardless of their lineage or background.

Therefore, the promise of David's throne lasting forever in Christian theology symbolizes the unending reign of Jesus Christ as the true King and Savior of all humanity. Christians find hope and comfort in the assurance that Jesus' kingdom will never end and that they can find salvation and redemption through him.
