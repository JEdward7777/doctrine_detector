Comment: The answer provides a solid understanding of the general responsibilities of a deacon in terms of serving the congregation and assisting with charity and social justice. However, from a Christian worldview, the primary role of a deacon is more specifically focused on serving the needs of the church body and supporting the spiritual well-being of the church community, in addition to practical matters. The response could benefit from including scriptural references and emphasizing the spiritual leadership aspect of deacons within the church.
