  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student touched on the concept of service and helping others, their answer lacked a clear focus on the biblical role of a deacon as outlined in the reference answer. The biblical role of a deacon is primarily focused on serving fellow believers with practical needs, and this aspect was not adequately emphasized in the student's response. The student did mention aspects of charity and social justice, which are important but should be grounded in biblical teachings on servanthood. More biblical references and emphasis on the specific responsibilities of a deacon in the context of the local church would have improved the answer."
