  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the practical aspects of deacon ministry. It accurately describes the role of deacons in serving the needs of the church community, specifically mentioning food and money. However, the answer lacks a deeper exploration of the theological or spiritual significance of deaconry, which could have earned a higher grade. Additionally, while referencing the cultural relevance of service is appropriate, it could have been elaborated further to connect it to Christian values and principles."
