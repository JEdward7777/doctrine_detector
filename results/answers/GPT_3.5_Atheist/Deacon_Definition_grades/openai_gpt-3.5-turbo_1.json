  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the practical aspect of a deacon's role in serving fellow believers with tangible needs such as food or money, which is in line with the concept of servanthood in the church. However, the response lacks depth in exploring the biblical foundation and significance of servanthood in the context of the deaconate role. More explicit reference to biblical principles related to servanthood and its importance in the church would have strengthened the response."
