Comment: The response effectively captures the practical aspect of a deacon's role in serving the needs of believers within the local church. However, the answer lacks specific reference to the biblical foundation of servanthood in the church. Drawing upon relevant scriptures or teachings on servanthood from the Bible would have enriched the explanation further.
