Grade: 65

Comment: While the response touches on the practical aspect of a deacon's role in serving fellow believers with practical needs, it lacks depth in understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating specific biblical references or principles that highlight the importance of servanthood and humility in Christian ministry.
