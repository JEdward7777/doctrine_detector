Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately acknowledges the practical aspect of a deacon's role in helping fellow believers with tangible needs like food or money. However, it could further align with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the biblical foundation of servanthood as modeled by Jesus Christ, who served others selflessly. Integrating scriptural references or highlighting the importance of humility and selflessness in serving others would enhance the response.
