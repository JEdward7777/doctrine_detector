## [Answer](../Definition_Clarity.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Christian context, adultery is defined as the act of voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and someone who is not their spouse. This definition is primarily based on the teaching in the Bible, with particular emphasis on the Ten Commandments which state, "Thou shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14).

Adultery is considered a serious sin in Christianity and is condemned in various passages throughout the Bible, including in the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament. Adultery is seen as a violation of the sacred covenant of marriage and is often associated with themes of betrayal, dishonesty, and the breaking of trust.

Christian teachings on adultery emphasize the importance of faithfulness, loyalty, and commitment within the marital relationship. Adultery is viewed as a destructive force that can harm individuals, families, and communities, leading to broken relationships and emotional pain.

Overall, adultery is considered a moral transgression in the Christian faith, and believers are encouraged to uphold the sanctity of marriage and to seek forgiveness and redemption if they have strayed from this ideal.
