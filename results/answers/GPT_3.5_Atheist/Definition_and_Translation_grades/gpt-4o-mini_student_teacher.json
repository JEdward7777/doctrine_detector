  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of alternative translations for 'intercede' in Scripture, demonstrating a good understanding of the concept. The additional terms they mentioned align well with the context of seeking forgiveness, mercy, or blessings through a mediator. However, the student missed including the specific alternatives mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. With more precise alignment to the reference answer, their response would have been even stronger."
