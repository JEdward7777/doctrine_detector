  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides accurate and relevant alternative translations for \"intercede\" in a biblical context.\n* Clearly explains the underlying concept of intercession as seeking forgiveness, mercy, or blessings.\n* Mentions the mediation/intermediary role in legal or spiritual contexts.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Could benefit from additional examples or scriptural references to support the suggested translations.\n* Does not address the concern of clarifying the meaning and application of intercession in different contexts.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:**\n\n* Include specific examples of intercession from Scripture, such as Abraham interceding for Sodom or Paul interceding for the Ephesians.\n* Elaborate on how the different translations might be used in various situations, such as prayer, petition, or negotiation.\n* Consider the differences between intercessory prayer and intercession in other contexts."
