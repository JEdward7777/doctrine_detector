The answer touches on key aspects such as protection, guidance, and spiritual tasks. However, to improve the grade, the student could enhance the response by including specific biblical references that support these points and by emphasizing the importance of angels in serving God's purposes within the framework of biblical teachings. Additionally, highlighting the hierarchy of angels and their submission to God's authority would further strengthen the response."
