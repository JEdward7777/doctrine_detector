  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the biblical definition and primary role of angels. They effectively convey the idea that angels are spiritual beings created by God to serve as messengers and agents of divine will. However, the student's answer could be improved by aligning more closely with the reference answer, which succinctly states that angels are powerful spirit beings created by God to serve Him primarily as messengers. By focusing on the core aspect of angelic beings as messengers of God, the student could enhance the clarity and conciseness of their response."
