It acknowledges their primary function of delivering God's messages and instructions. The understanding of angels presented in the response supports the concern that recognizing their role can deepen faith and provide assurance of God's protection and guidance. The response could be enhanced by incorporating specific biblical references or examples to further strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
