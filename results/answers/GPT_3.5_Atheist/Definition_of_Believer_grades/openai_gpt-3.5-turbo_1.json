However, the concern specified clarification on the identity and significance of being a believer in Christ, which the response did not address. A Christian-specific worldview would emphasize the spiritual transformation, commitment, and relationship with Christ that define the identity and significance of being a believer. Further elaboration on these aspects would have improved the response."
