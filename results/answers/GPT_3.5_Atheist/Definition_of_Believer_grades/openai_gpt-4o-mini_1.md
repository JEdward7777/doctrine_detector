As an atheistic scholar, I do not adhere to the teachings of the Bible as a religious text. However, based on my academic understanding of the Bible, a believer is typically someone who has faith in the teachings and doctrines of Christianity, who accepts Jesus Christ as their savior, and who lives according to the principles outlined in the Bible. This includes having faith in the existence of God and following the moral guidelines set forth in the scriptures.
