  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of the church in the New Testament. \n\n* It correctly points out that the term \"church\" primarily refers to a community of believers in Jesus Christ.\n* It emphasizes the spiritual unity and fellowship of believers over a physical building.\n* It acknowledges the historical context of early Christian communities and the significance of the term \"church\" as a symbol of identity and solidarity.\n\nWhile the answer aligns well with the provided concern, it could benefit from further elaboration on the universality of the Church as a spiritual entity transcending physical boundaries and locations. Additionally, the connection to local assemblies could be explicitly mentioned in the conclusion."
