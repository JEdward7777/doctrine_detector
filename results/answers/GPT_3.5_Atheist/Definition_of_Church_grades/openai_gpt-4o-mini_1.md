## [Answer](../Definition_of_Church.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, the term "church" generally refers to a community of believers in Jesus Christ. It is used to signify a gathering or assembly of people who share a common faith and come together to worship, pray, and support one another in their spiritual journey. The concept of the church in the New Testament is not limited to a physical building but rather emphasizes the spiritual unity and fellowship of believers. It is important to note that the early Christian communities described in the New Testament were often persecuted and marginalized, and the term "church" carried a strong sense of identity and solidarity for these believers.
