Confession in the Bible typically refers to the act of acknowledging one's sins or wrongdoings before God. It involves expressing genuine remorse and seeking forgiveness for those transgressions. In many Christian traditions, confession is seen as a crucial step towards receiving redemption and spiritual renewal.

Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of confession in the broader sense but lacks specific references to the biblical context of confession. While it correctly mentions admitting one's sins before God, it could have been strengthened by citing specific biblical passages that emphasize the importance of confession as a key aspect of Christian faith and practice.
