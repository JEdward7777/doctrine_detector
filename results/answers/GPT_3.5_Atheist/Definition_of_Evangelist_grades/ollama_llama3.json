  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear definition of what an evangelist means, which is partially correct in that it mentions spreading good news. However, the concern was specifically about understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel, and while the response touches on this, it doesn't provide much depth or insight into what that role entails. The answer also lacks biblical references or illustrations to support its claims. Nevertheless, it shows a basic grasp of the term's meaning, which earns it a decent grade. To improve, the response could delve deeper into the evangelist's role in sharing the gospel and provide more scriptural backing for its statements."
