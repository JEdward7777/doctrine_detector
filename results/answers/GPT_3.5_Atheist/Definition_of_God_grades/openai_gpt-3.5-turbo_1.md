The Bible, being a religious text, describes God as an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving being who created the universe and continues to oversee and interact with creation. God is portrayed as just, merciful, and compassionate, but also as a deity who demands obedience and worship from His followers. Additionally, the Bible often depicts God as a personal being who communicates with humans through prophets and direct intervention in human affairs.
