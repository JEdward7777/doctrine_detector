  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student's answer provides a solid explanation of the Biblical definition of 'good' contrasted with 'evil' by emphasizing alignment with God's will, virtues, and consequences of actions. The mention of how these concepts may differ from atheistic perspectives adds depth to the analysis. However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into specific Biblical examples of 'good' and 'evil' behaviors or consequences, as well as citing relevant scripture to support the points made. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
