The term "gospel" literally means "good news." In the context of the Bible, the term specifically refers to the message of salvation and redemption through Jesus Christ. The Gospels in the New Testament, written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, recount the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and are considered the foundational texts of Christianity. The good news of the gospel is that through faith in Jesus, believers can be forgiven of their sins and have eternal life.

Comment: The response provides a concise and accurate understanding of the term "gospel" as good news related to God's salvation through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. It effectively captures the essence of the gospel message in Christianity. The slight deduction in points is due to the original response providing a bit more detail on the Gospels in the New Testament and their role in recounting the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
