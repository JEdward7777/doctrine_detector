The term "gospel" literally means "good news." In the context of the Bible, the term specifically refers to the message of salvation and redemption through Jesus Christ. The Gospels in the New Testament, written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, recount the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and are considered the foundational texts of Christianity. The good news of the gospel is that through faith in Jesus, believers can be forgiven of their sins and have eternal life.

Comment: The response effectively explains that the term "gospel" means "good news" and accurately conveys the message of God's salvation through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. It portrays a strong understanding of the significance of the Gospel in the Christian faith. The only slight deduction is that it could have elaborated a bit more on the role of faith in receiving this salvation, as faith is central to Christian belief and practice.
