  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible from a Christian worldview. It correctly highlights God's holiness, perfection, separateness from sin, and the moral implications for believers. The only improvement could have been to include a reference to specific Bible verses or examples that illustrate the concept of God as the Holy One."
