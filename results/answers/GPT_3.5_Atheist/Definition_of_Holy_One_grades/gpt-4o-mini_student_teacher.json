They correctly mention the significance of this term in highlighting God's moral purity and righteousness, as well as the call for believers to strive for holiness. However, the answer could be improved by specifying the connection of the term 'Holy One' to 'Holy One of Israel' in the Old Testament and Jesus in the New Testament, as highlighted in the reference answer."
