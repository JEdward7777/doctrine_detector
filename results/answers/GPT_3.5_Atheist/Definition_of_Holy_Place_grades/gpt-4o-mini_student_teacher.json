They effectively highlighted the separation between the divine and the mundane and the importance of maintaining purity in the holy place. However, the student could have further focused on the specific elements contained within the holy place, as mentioned in the reference answer, to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the design and function of God's dwelling place."
