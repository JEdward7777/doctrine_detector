In the context of the tabernacle or temple in ancient religious practices, the "holy place" held great significance as it symbolized the presence of the deity or deities worshiped by the followers of that faith. It was a sacred space where rituals, ceremonies, and sacrifices were conducted to honor and commune with the divine.

For the Israelites, the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle or temple was believed to be the dwelling place of God, and only the high priest was allowed to enter this inner sanctum once a year on Yom Kippur. This innermost part of the sanctuary was seen as the most sacred and revered space, and its purity had to be maintained through strict adherence to religious laws and rituals.

The concept of the "holy place" emphasized the separation between the divine and the mundane, signifying the transcendence and purity of the divine presence. It served as a focal point for religious devotion and a physical representation of the spiritual connection between humanity and the divine.

Overall, the significance of the "holy place" in the tabernacle or temple was central to the religious beliefs and practices of ancient cultures, reflecting their understanding of the sacred and the importance of maintaining a sense of awe and reverence in the presence of the divine.
