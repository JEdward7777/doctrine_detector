The reference to seeking forgiveness from both God and others is also well-stated. However, there is a slight lack of emphasis on the role of genuine faith and trust in God's forgiveness and grace in the process of repentance. Additionally, describing repentance as a means to avoid punishment or judgment may not fully capture the Biblical understanding of repentance as a response to God's love and mercy."
