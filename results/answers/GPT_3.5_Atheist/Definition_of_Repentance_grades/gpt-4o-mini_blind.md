Comment: The answer provides a generally accurate explanation of repentance according to the Bible, emphasizing turning away from sin and turning towards God. The reference to seeking forgiveness from both God and others is also well-stated. However, there is a slight lack of emphasis on the role of genuine faith and trust in God's forgiveness and grace in the process of repentance. Additionally, describing repentance as a means to avoid punishment or judgment may not fully capture the Biblical understanding of repentance as a response to God's love and mercy.
