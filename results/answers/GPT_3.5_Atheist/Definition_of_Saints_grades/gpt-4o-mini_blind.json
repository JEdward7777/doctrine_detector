The mention of saints being models of faith and virtue for believers is accurate. The response could be improved by emphasizing the role of Christ's righteousness imputed to believers as foundational to their designation as saints, as well as by briefly touching on the distinction between the universal priesthood of all believers and the special recognition of certain individuals as saints."
