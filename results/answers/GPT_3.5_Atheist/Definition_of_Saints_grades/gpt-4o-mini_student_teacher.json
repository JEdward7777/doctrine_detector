  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student's answer is overall accurate in describing the concept of saints in the New Testament, the concern raised about distinguishing between cultural and scriptural interpretations is not completely addressed. The student could have emphasized more on the Biblical definition of saints as \"holy ones\" referring specifically to believers in Jesus, which was the main point of the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the student could have elaborated more on how the term 'saints' in the New Testament relates to the broader Biblical narrative of sanctification and consecration by God.\n\nThis grade reflects a solid understanding of the topic with room for improvement in addressing the concern raised in the provided context."
