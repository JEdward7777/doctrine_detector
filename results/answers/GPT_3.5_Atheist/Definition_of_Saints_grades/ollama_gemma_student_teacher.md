What does the term 'saints' mean in the context of the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
The term 'saints' literally means 'holy ones' and refers to believers in Jesus.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints helps to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, the term 'saints' refers to individuals who are believed to be exceptionally holy, righteous, and dedicated to serving God. They are considered to be models of faith and virtue for other believers to emulate. The concept of saints in the New Testament is closely linked to the idea of spiritual purity and sanctity. It is important to note that the New Testament does not introduce the formal canonization process that is later developed in Christian traditions, but rather presents saints as those who have been set apart for a special purpose by God.
