## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, the term 'saints' refers to individuals who are believed to be exceptionally holy, righteous, and dedicated to serving God. They are considered to be models of faith and virtue for other believers to emulate. The concept of saints in the New Testament is closely linked to the idea of spiritual purity and sanctity. It is important to note that the New Testament does not introduce the formal canonization process that is later developed in Christian traditions, but rather presents saints as those who have been set apart for a special purpose by God.
