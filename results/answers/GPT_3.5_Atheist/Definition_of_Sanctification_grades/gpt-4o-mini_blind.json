However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the biblical understanding of sanctification, including references to key scriptures that explain the process and significance of sanctification in the Christian faith. Additionally, the mention of atheism and non-believers, while attempting to be inclusive, is not entirely relevant to the question and could be seen as a distraction from the main focus on the Christian concept of sanctification."
