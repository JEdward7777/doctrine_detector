  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer contains a good overview of the concept of sanctification in a general religious context, but there is a lack of emphasis on the specific biblical definition of sanctification according to the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student made a commendable effort in explaining sanctification as making something holy and the spiritual growth aspect, yet the response could have been strengthened by focusing more on the biblical perspective and the process of being made holy according to Christian teachings."
