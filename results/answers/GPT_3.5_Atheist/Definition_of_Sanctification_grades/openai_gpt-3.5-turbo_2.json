The inclusion of additional context on the religious significance and implications of sanctification aligns well with the concern raised regarding understanding the biblical definition. The mention of different perspectives, including that of atheists and non-believers, also demonstrates consideration for varying viewpoints. Overall, a well-rounded response that effectively addresses the concern."
