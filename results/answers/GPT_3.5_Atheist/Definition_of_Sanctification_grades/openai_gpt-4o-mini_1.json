  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of sanctification, aligning well with the biblical definition and mentioning key aspects such as becoming more like God, spiritual purity, moral growth, and dedication to God's service. The mention of sanctification as a lifelong journey and the differentiation between religious and secular perspectives shows a good understanding of the concept. However, more specific references to biblical passages or theological teachings could enhance the depth of the response."
