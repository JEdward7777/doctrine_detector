## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the religious context, to sanctify means to make something holy or to set it apart for sacred use. The concept of sanctification is often mentioned in the Bible, where it refers to the process of becoming more like God or achieving spiritual purity. It is seen as a transformative process where individuals are separated from sin and dedicated to God's service.

Sanctification is associated with moral and spiritual growth, inner renewal, and a commitment to following God's commands. It is considered to be a lifelong journey of striving for holiness and righteousness.

For atheists and non-believers, sanctification may not hold the same spiritual significance, but the idea of striving for personal growth, ethical behavior, and a sense of purpose could still be relevant and valuable aspects of human experience.
