  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of wisdom according to the biblical perspective. They correctly emphasize the importance of wisdom as a gift from God, the alignment with God's teachings, and the practical application of wisdom in one's life. The mention of virtues such as humility, patience, discernment, righteousness, compassion, and justice align well with biblical teachings on wisdom. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific examples or references to biblical passages that illustrate these points."
