  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive and well-explained response to the question about the biblical definition of wisdom. They discuss key aspects such as aligning decisions with God's principles, seeking knowledge and understanding of God's ways, and living a virtuous life marked by righteousness and compassion. The student also emphasizes the importance of faith, humility, and obedience to God's will in demonstrating wisdom.\n\nWhile the student's answer goes beyond the reference answer by exploring various dimensions of wisdom and its application in life, they could have strengthened their response by providing more direct references to specific biblical passages or examples to support their points. Incorporating more scriptural references would enhance the credibility and depth of their argument.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical concept of wisdom, and their response aligns well with a Christian worldview focusing on God's principles and moral living."
