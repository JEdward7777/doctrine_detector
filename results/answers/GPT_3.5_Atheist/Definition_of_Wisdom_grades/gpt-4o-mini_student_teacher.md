In the biblical context, wisdom is often defined as the ability to make good decisions based on knowledge and understanding that is guided by God's principles. It is seen as a gift from God and is closely related to virtues such as humility, patience, and discernment.

Wisdom in the biblical sense is not just intellectual knowledge, but also a way of living that is marked by righteousness, compassion, and a deep sense of justice. It entails recognizing one's own limitations and weaknesses, and relying on God for guidance and strength to lead a virtuous life.
