The description of wisdom as a gift from God and its connection to making morally sound choices is also well-represented.\n\nThe response aligns with the given answer, which defines wisdom as understanding what is right and moral, pleasing God, and practicing what is true and morally right. The concern about understanding the biblical concept of wisdom is also addressed, highlighting its importance for making decisions that align with God's will.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the lack of direct reference to specific biblical passages or verses that support the definition of wisdom. Adding concrete scriptural references would further strengthen the response."
