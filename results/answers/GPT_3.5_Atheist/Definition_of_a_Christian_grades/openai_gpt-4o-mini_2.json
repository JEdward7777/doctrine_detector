However, it focuses on a critical aspect but does not encompass the broader understanding of what it means to be a Christian as outlined in the Bible, which includes following Jesus' teachings, living a life of love and compassion, and upholding the teachings of the Bible. Addressing these aspects would provide a more comprehensive view of Christian identity according to biblical teachings."
