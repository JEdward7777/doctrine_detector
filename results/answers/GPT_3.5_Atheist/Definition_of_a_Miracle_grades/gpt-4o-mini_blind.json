  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: The student accurately describes the general understanding of miracles and their connection to God's authority in religious contexts. However, the answer lacks depth in exploring the biblical perspective of miracles as recorded in the Bible, such as in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. The explanation could have been strengthened by referencing specific biblical examples of miracles and how they directly relate to God's authority. Additionally, the comparison between theistic and atheistic perspectives could have been further expanded upon to highlight the differences in understanding and interpretation of miracles."
