  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of miracles from both a theistic and atheistic perspective, showcasing an understanding of different viewpoints. However, the answer lacks emphasis on the view that miracles are specifically manifestations of God's authority and power, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student effectively addresses the concern by discussing how the concept of miracles can impact faith and recognition of God's power, but could improve by explicitly connecting the definition of a miracle to God's authority as the source of supernatural intervention."
