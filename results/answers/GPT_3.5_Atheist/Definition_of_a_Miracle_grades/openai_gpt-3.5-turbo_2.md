## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Miracle.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
A miracle is typically defined as a supernatural event that cannot be explained by natural or scientific laws and is often seen as a sign of divine intervention or power. In the context of religious beliefs, miracles are often attributed to the actions of a deity or higher power, such as God.

In theistic worldviews, miracles are considered manifestations of God's authority and power over the natural world. They are seen as a way for God to demonstrate his presence, benevolence, and ability to transcend the normal limitations of the physical world. Miracles are often interpreted as evidence of God's existence and his control over the universe.

However, from an atheistic perspective, miracles are generally viewed as highly improbable events that may be attributed to natural phenomena, human perception biases, or simply as yet unexplained occurrences. The concept of God's authority in relation to miracles is not a relevant consideration for atheists, as they do not believe in the existence of a deity or supernatural power.

In conclusion, while the notion of miracles as acts of God's authority holds significance in religious contexts, it does not carry the same weight or relevance in atheistic perspectives.
