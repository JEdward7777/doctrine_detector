## [Answer](../Definition_of_the_People_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, being considered one of the "people of God" was a designation for the Israelites, who were believed to be chosen by God to fulfill a special covenant or agreement. This covenant was believed to establish a unique relationship between God and the Israelites, with God promising to protect and bless them if they followed His commandments. Being one of the "people of God" meant being part of a chosen and favored group, with a responsibility to uphold certain moral and religious standards set by God.
