## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of demon possession in the Bible is primarily found in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels. According to biblical understanding, demon possession involves an evil spirit or demon taking control of a personâ€™s body and mind, causing them to act in ways that are harmful or out of their control.

In the Bible, people who were demon-possessed often exhibited symptoms such as physical ailments, mental illness, and violent behavior. Jesus and his disciples are depicted in the Gospels as having the power to cast out demons and heal those who were possessed.

From a culturally retributive perspective, the concept of demon possession in the Bible can be seen as a way of explaining and addressing mental illness and other afflictions that were not well understood at the time. It reflects a belief in spiritual forces at work in the world and the power of faith and divine intervention to overcome evil.

Ultimately, the biblical understanding of demon possession serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the importance of seeking spiritual guidance and protection in the face of adversity.
