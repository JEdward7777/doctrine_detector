However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies such as attributing demon possession as a way to explain mental illness and referring to a \"culturally retributive perspective.\" In a Christian worldview, demon possession is not merely a cultural explanation but a spiritual reality involving demonic forces. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the authority of Jesus in addressing demon possession and the overall biblical teachings on spiritual warfare."
