The connection to Jesus Christ and the power of deliverance is touched upon but could be further emphasized to align more closely with a Christian worldview. Encouraging a clearer focus on the role of Jesus Christ in spiritual warfare and the necessity of seeking deliverance through Him would strengthen the response from a Christian perspective."
