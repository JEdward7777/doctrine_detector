  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and nuanced explanation of the key differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish'. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the nuanced tones and implications of each term within a culturally retributed context. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer could have delved deeper into the spiritual implications of these terms, especially in relation to biblical teachings on discipline, encouragement, and exhortation. Additionally, integrating Scriptural references or examples would have enhanced the answer from a doctrinal perspective."
