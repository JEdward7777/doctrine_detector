  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' within a culturally retributed context. However, the explanation strayed somewhat from the scriptural perspective provided in the reference answer. While the student's response demonstrated a good understanding of the nuances of these terms in a general context, there was a lack of direct connection to how these concepts should be applied according to a Christian worldview. Encouragement, exhortation, and admonishment in a Biblical sense carry specific implications and purposes based on scriptural principles that were not fully addressed in the student's answer. Consider incorporating more insights from a Christian perspective in future responses."
