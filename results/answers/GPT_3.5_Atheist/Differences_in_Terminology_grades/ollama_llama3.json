  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response provides some general information about the meanings of \"exhort\", \"encourage\", and \"admonish\", it does not effectively address the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. The response does not provide any specific biblical examples or references that illustrate how these terms are used in a scriptural context.\n\nAdditionally, the response's focus on cultural connotations and implications may not directly relate to the concern of clarifying the proper use of these terms from a biblical perspective.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to incorporate more explicit biblical references and examples that demonstrate how these terms are used in a way that is consistent with scriptural teachings."
