## [Answer](../Differences_in_Terminology.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In a culturally retributed context, the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' each carry different connotations and implications.

- 'Exhort' typically involves urging someone to do something with a sense of urgency, passion, or enthusiasm. It is often associated with motivating others through strong appeals or persuasive language. In a retributed context, exhortation may involve emphasizing the benefits of certain actions or behaviors, highlighting the consequences of inaction, and encouraging positive change in accordance with societal norms or values.

- 'Encourage', on the other hand, conveys a more positive and supportive tone. It involves instilling confidence, offering reassurance, and fostering a sense of hope or optimism in others. Encouragement in a retributed context may involve praising individuals for their efforts, acknowledging their progress or achievements, and providing emotional support to help them overcome challenges or obstacles.

- 'Admonish' carries a slightly more critical or cautionary tone compared to 'exhort' and 'encourage'. It often involves warning or reprimanding someone for a perceived wrongdoing or error in judgment. Admonishment in a retributed context may serve as a form of correction or guidance, aiming to discourage undesirable behavior, uphold moral standards, or prevent future transgressions within the cultural framework.

In summary, while 'exhort' emphasizes motivation and urgency, 'encourage' focuses on support and positivity, and 'admonish' leans towards correction and caution within the context of culturally retributed norms.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the response provides some general information about the meanings of "exhort", "encourage", and "admonish", it does not effectively address the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. The response does not provide any specific biblical examples or references that illustrate how these terms are used in a scriptural context.

Additionally, the response's focus on cultural connotations and implications may not directly relate to the concern of clarifying the proper use of these terms from a biblical perspective.

To improve this response, it would be helpful to incorporate more explicit biblical references and examples that demonstrate how these terms are used in a way that is consistent with scriptural teachings.
