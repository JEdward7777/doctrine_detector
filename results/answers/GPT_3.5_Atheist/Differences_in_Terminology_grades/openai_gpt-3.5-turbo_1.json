It acknowledges the varying tones and purposes of each term. However, the response could have strengthened its Christian perspective by referencing specific biblical examples or principles that illustrate the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement. An additional scriptural foundation would have further enhanced the analysis from a Christian worldview."
