  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively expands on the initial definitions by providing a more detailed explanation of each term in a culturally retributed context. It recognizes the nuances of 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' within the framework of motivation, support, and correction. The response aligns well with the concern by considering the appropriate use of these forms of encouragement according to scripture. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on encouragement and correction."
