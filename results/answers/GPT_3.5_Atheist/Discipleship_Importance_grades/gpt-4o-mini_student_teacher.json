However, the answer strays away from the Christian worldview by not focusing on the unique call and purpose given by Jesus to the apostles. The reference answer emphasizes the apostles' role in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the Church, which is crucial in understanding the significance of the apostles in the New Testament from a Christian perspective. The student's answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the divine intention behind the selection of the twelve apostles."
