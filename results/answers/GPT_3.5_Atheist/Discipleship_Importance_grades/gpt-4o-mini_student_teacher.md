## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a purely historical and scholarly perspective, the selection of the twelve apostles as Jesus' closest disciples can be understood as a strategic decision to spread his teachings and establish a new religious movement. The number twelve may have been symbolic, representing the twelve tribes of Israel and highlighting Jesus as a new leader for the Jewish people.

In a culturally retributed context, we can also consider the significance of the apostles in the Christian faith as representatives of different aspects of society. For example, fishermen like Peter and Andrew were chosen to show that Jesus' message was for all people, regardless of their social status. Tax collectors like Matthew were included to highlight the transformative power of Jesus' teachings.

Overall, the selection of the twelve apostles can be seen as a deliberate choice by Jesus to create a diverse and dedicated group of followers who would continue his mission after his death, ultimately leading to the establishment of Christianity as a major world religion.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer provides some relevant historical and societal context for the selection of the twelve apostles, which is commendable. However, the answer strays away from the Christian worldview by not focusing on the unique call and purpose given by Jesus to the apostles. The reference answer emphasizes the apostles' role in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the Church, which is crucial in understanding the significance of the apostles in the New Testament from a Christian perspective. The student's answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the divine intention behind the selection of the twelve apostles.
