  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, providing a clear explanation of Jesus' strategic decision to choose the twelve apostles as his closest disciples. The author also provides some cultural context by highlighting the diversity of the apostles, such as Peter's occupation as a fisherman and Matthew's background as a tax collector.\n\nThe response is well-structured and easy to follow, with logical connections between sentences. The language is clear and concise, making it accessible to readers. However, I would deduct a few points because the response does not fully engage with the given answer or provide more depth in its analysis. The response primarily focuses on providing general information about the apostles' role without explicitly addressing any theological or biblical nuances.\n\nComment: While this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance of the apostles, it would benefit from more explicit engagement with the given answer and further exploration of the biblical context."
