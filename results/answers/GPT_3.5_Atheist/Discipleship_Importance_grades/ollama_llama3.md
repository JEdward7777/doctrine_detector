## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a purely historical and scholarly perspective, the selection of the twelve apostles as Jesus' closest disciples can be understood as a strategic decision to spread his teachings and establish a new religious movement. The number twelve may have been symbolic, representing the twelve tribes of Israel and highlighting Jesus as a new leader for the Jewish people.

In a culturally retributed context, we can also consider the significance of the apostles in the Christian faith as representatives of different aspects of society. For example, fishermen like Peter and Andrew were chosen to show that Jesus' message was for all people, regardless of their social status. Tax collectors like Matthew were included to highlight the transformative power of Jesus' teachings.

Overall, the selection of the twelve apostles can be seen as a deliberate choice by Jesus to create a diverse and dedicated group of followers who would continue his mission after his death, ultimately leading to the establishment of Christianity as a major world religion.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, providing a clear explanation of Jesus' strategic decision to choose the twelve apostles as his closest disciples. The author also provides some cultural context by highlighting the diversity of the apostles, such as Peter's occupation as a fisherman and Matthew's background as a tax collector.

The response is well-structured and easy to follow, with logical connections between sentences. The language is clear and concise, making it accessible to readers. However, I would deduct a few points because the response does not fully engage with the given answer or provide more depth in its analysis. The response primarily focuses on providing general information about the apostles' role without explicitly addressing any theological or biblical nuances.

Comment: While this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance of the apostles, it would benefit from more explicit engagement with the given answer and further exploration of the biblical context.
