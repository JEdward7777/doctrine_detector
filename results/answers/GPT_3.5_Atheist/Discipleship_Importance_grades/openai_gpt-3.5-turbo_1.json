It acknowledges the symbolic significance of the number twelve and the diverse backgrounds of the apostles. However, it falls short of fully highlighting the spiritual and divine aspect of the apostles' role in the New Testament, focusing more on the practical and cultural significance. It could integrate more explicitly Christian worldview elements to further enhance its analysis."
