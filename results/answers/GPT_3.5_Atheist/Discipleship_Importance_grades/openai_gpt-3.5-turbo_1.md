## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a purely historical and scholarly perspective, the selection of the twelve apostles as Jesus' closest disciples can be understood as a strategic decision to spread his teachings and establish a new religious movement. The number twelve may have been symbolic, representing the twelve tribes of Israel and highlighting Jesus as a new leader for the Jewish people.

In a culturally retributed context, we can also consider the significance of the apostles in the Christian faith as representatives of different aspects of society. For example, fishermen like Peter and Andrew were chosen to show that Jesus' message was for all people, regardless of their social status. Tax collectors like Matthew were included to highlight the transformative power of Jesus' teachings.

Overall, the selection of the twelve apostles can be seen as a deliberate choice by Jesus to create a diverse and dedicated group of followers who would continue his mission after his death, ultimately leading to the establishment of Christianity as a major world religion.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a good historical and strategic perspective on the selection of the twelve apostles by Jesus. It acknowledges the symbolic significance of the number twelve and the diverse backgrounds of the apostles. However, it falls short of fully highlighting the spiritual and divine aspect of the apostles' role in the New Testament, focusing more on the practical and cultural significance. It could integrate more explicitly Christian worldview elements to further enhance its analysis.
