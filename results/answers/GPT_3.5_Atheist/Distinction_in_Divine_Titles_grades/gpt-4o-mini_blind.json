  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively explains the importance of not translating \"Lord Yahweh\" as \"Lord LORD\" by highlighting the significance of the personal name of God, Yahweh, in contrast to the generic title \"Lord.\" The student appropriately emphasizes the need to preserve the distinction and reverence associated with God's name in the biblical text. Overall, this answer demonstrates a sound understanding of the theological implications involved in translation accuracy."
