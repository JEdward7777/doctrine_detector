After King Solomon's reign, a significant event in Israel's history was the division of the kingdom into two separate entities: the Kingdom of Israel in the north, with its capital in Samaria, and the Kingdom of Judah in the south, with its capital in Jerusalem. This division occurred due to political tensions and disputes over leadership succession, leading to the formation of two distinct kingdoms with different rulers and cultural practices.
