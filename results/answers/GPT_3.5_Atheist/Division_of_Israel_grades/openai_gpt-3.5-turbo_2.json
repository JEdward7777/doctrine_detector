  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise summary of the division of Israel into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah after King Solomon's reign. The answer accurately identifies the key kingdoms formed. However, the grade is slightly lower due to a lack of elaboration on the historical and spiritual significance of this division. Further explanation on how this division impacted the Israelites spiritually and historically would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
