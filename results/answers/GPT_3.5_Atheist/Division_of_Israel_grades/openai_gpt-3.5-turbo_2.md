After King Solomon's reign, a significant event in Israel's history was the division of the kingdom into two separate entities: the Kingdom of Israel in the north, with its capital in Samaria, and the Kingdom of Judah in the south, with its capital in Jerusalem. This division occurred due to political tensions and disputes over leadership succession, leading to the formation of two distinct kingdoms with different rulers and cultural practices.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear and concise summary of the division of Israel into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah after King Solomon's reign. The answer accurately identifies the key kingdoms formed. However, the grade is slightly lower due to a lack of elaboration on the historical and spiritual significance of this division. Further explanation on how this division impacted the Israelites spiritually and historically would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
