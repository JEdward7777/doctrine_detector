  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the phrase \"do good to\" within a Christian context, emphasizing the importance of acts of kindness, love, compassion, and selflessness in line with Jesus' teachings. The student effectively connects the concept to core Christian beliefs such as loving one's neighbor and serving others. However, the response could have been strengthened by incorporating specific references to relevant Bible verses or theological principles to support the explanation further."
