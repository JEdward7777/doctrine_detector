The answer effectively conveys the importance of living out one's faith through good deeds. However, the student's response could be improved by focusing more directly on actively benefiting others, being kind, and reflecting Christ's love, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on doing good to others."
