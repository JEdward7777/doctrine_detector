  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student shows a decent understanding of the concept of dominion over the earth as presented in the Bible, mentioning the responsibility given to humanity. However, the response does not clearly emphasize the Biblical perspective of dominion as rooted in God's creation and directive to steward His creation. The mention of atheistic views detracts from a clear Biblical perspective on the topic. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on the Biblical worldview of stewardship and God-given responsibilities regarding the earth."
