Additionally, the student provides a nuanced consideration of the ethical responsibility to care for creation, drawing attention to the concerns of sustainability and responsible practices. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific biblical passages that support the concept of dominion, and how these passages are interpreted in different Christian traditions."
