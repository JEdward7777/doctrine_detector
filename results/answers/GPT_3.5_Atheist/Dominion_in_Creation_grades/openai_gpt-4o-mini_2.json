  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively references the biblical mandate of dominion over creation and highlights the responsibility to manage and care for it. The discussion on varying interpretations within Christian traditions adds depth to the analysis. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more direct integration of how the given concern of understanding and responsibly exercising God-given authority over creation is addressed in the response."
