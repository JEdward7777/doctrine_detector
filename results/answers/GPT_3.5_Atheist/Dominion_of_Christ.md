In the Bible, Jesus Christ's dominion is described as one of ultimate authority and power over all creation. Various verses in the New Testament portray Jesus as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, emphasizing his supremacy and sovereignty over the universe. One key passage that highlights Jesus' dominion is found in the book of Revelation, where it speaks of him ruling with a rod of iron and having a name written on his robe and thigh: "King of kings and Lord of lords." This imagery underscores Jesus' reign as eternal, glorious, and unmatched in its breadth and depth.
