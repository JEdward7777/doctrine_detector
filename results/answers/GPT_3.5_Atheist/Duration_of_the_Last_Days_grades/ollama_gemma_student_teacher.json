  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical perspective on the \"last days\" and their duration. They accurately explain that the specific timeframe is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible and discuss the varying interpretations among Christian denominations. The emphasis on spiritual preparation rather than counting down the time is also well-articulated. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful response that aligns with the Christian worldview."
