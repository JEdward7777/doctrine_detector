It acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the duration of the \"last days\" and how it can influence Christian living in anticipation of Christ's return. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps reference specific biblical passages that talk about being watchful and ready for the second coming of Christ, to further emphasize the importance of living out one's faith in light of this uncertainty."
