It also falls short in fully recognizing the importance of the Holy Spirit's empowerment in the lives of Christians for effective ministry and living out their faith. A Christian worldview would emphasize the essential role of the Holy Spirit in guiding believers, empowering them for service, and leading them in proclaiming the Gospel, which is indispensable for fulfilling the mission of the Church."
