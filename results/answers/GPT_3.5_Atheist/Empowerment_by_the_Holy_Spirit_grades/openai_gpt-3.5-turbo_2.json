It recognizes the importance of the Holy Spirit's role in empowering Christians for ministry and living out their faith. However, the response could have emphasized more on the necessity of acknowledging the Holy Spirit as a supernatural force guiding and enabling Christians, which is crucial from a Christian worldview. Additionally, it could have highlighted the unique relationship believers have with the Holy Spirit, guiding them in accordance with God's will."
