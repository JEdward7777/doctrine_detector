However, while it recognizes the significance of the Holy Spirit in empowering Christians, it lacks acknowledgment of the crucial role of the Holy Spirit in guiding believers to proclaim the Gospel and live out their faith effectively. A stronger emphasis on the importance of the Holy Spirit's empowerment for effective ministry and faithful living would enhance the evaluation from a Christian worldview perspective."
