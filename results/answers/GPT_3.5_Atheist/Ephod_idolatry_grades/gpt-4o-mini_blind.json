They correctly highlight the dangers of superstition, corruption, and the temptation to elevate material objects or symbols above faith. However, to improve, they could have strengthened their answer by explicitly connecting these dangers to the biblical teaching on idolatry and the consequences outlined in Scripture. They could also have emphasized the need for wholehearted devotion to God alone, in line with Christian doctrine."
