  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as an 85. The student effectively grasped the significance of Gideon's creation of the gold ephod and the subsequent idolatry of the Israelites by recognizing the dangers of superstition and the potential for corruption when religious symbols are misused. They also correctly highlighted the importance of prioritizing a sincere relationship with faith over external symbols or rituals. However, the student could have tied their discussion back to the specific concern provided more closely and displayed a deeper understanding of the Christian viewpoint on idolatry."
