  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written response that effectively analyzes the story of Gideon and the Israelites. It clearly explains the dangers of superstition and the potential for corruption when religious symbols are misused. The student also provides a helpful cautionary tale about the importance of maintaining a sincere and authentic relationship with beliefs rather than placing undue importance on external symbols or rituals."
