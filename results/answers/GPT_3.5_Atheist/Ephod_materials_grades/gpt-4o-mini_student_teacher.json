  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student accurately identified the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod as gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen, which aligns with the biblical account from Exodus. The inclusion of fine linen in the student's response further enriches the understanding of the ephod's composition. However, the teacher's reference answer specifies that the ephod was embroidered with gold, blue, purple, and red yarn, indicating a slight discrepancy. The student's response effectively demonstrates a knowledge of the materials, but could have been more precise in aligning with the teacher's exact wording for a higher score."
