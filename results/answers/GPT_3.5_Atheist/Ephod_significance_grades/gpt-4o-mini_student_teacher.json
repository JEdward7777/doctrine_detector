  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a good understanding of the symbolic significance of the high priest's ephod in representing priestly authority and intercession. However, the student's analysis veers off into a negative portrayal of the ephod as a tool for power and control by religious leaders, which does not align well with a Christian worldview. The focus should be more on the spiritual significance and role of the ephod in Old Testament worship."
