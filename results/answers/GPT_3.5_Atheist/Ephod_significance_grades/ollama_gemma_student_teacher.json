They accurately highlight its symbolic representation of priestly authority and intercession, as well as its connection to the twelve tribes of Israel. Additionally, the student offers a critical analysis of the garment's potential power dynamics within the religious hierarchy. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific functions of the Urim and Thummim, as mentioned in the reference answer."
