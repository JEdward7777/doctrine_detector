However, the additional analysis from a culturally retributed perspective slightly detracts from the Christian worldview focus. The emphasis on power dynamics and influence in the religious hierarchy could be further explored from a biblical perspective to enhance the response. Overall, a good explanation but could benefit from more integration of Christian principles."
