## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I do not believe in eternal consequences in a religious sense. The concept of “perishing” is typically associated with religious beliefs that include notions of heaven and hell or some form of afterlife. From a philosophical and secular perspective, one could interpret “perishing” as a metaphor for the ultimate end of one's existence without any continuation or consciousness after death. The idea of eternal consequences for those who are described as “perishing” is constructed within religious frameworks and may not have tangible relevance outside of those belief systems.
