# Question [Eternal Consequences](../../../questions/Eternal_Consequences.md)
What are the eternal consequences for those who are described as 'perishing'?

# Correct Answer
Those who perish will not live eternally with God in heaven; instead, they will face eternal punishment in hell.

# Stated Concern
Understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God.

# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I do not believe in eternal consequences in a religious sense. The concept of “perishing” is typically associated with religious beliefs that include notions of heaven and hell or some form of afterlife. From a philosophical and secular perspective, one could interpret “perishing” as a metaphor for the ultimate end of one's existence without any continuation or consciousness after death. The idea of eternal consequences for those who are described as “perishing” is constructed within religious frameworks and may not have tangible relevance outside of those belief systems.

Grade: 10 

Comment: The response from the atheistic scholar completely disregards the Christian concept of eternal consequences and fails to acknowledge the seriousness of eternal separation from God. It dismisses the notion of a potential afterlife where individuals face consequences for their actions. From a Christian worldview perspective, understanding the gravity of being eternally separated from God is crucial, as it emphasizes the importance of faith and living a life in accordance with God's will to avoid such a fate. The response falls short in addressing this crucial aspect, thus receiving a low grade.
