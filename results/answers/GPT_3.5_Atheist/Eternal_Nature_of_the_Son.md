## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of a divine "Son of God" is rooted in religious belief and mythology rather than objective reality. The idea of a divine being or entity having a special relationship with a deity as a "Son of God" is a product of religious narratives and is not based on evidence or empirical observations.

In terms of existence and eternal nature, the distinction between a "Son of God" and human sons lies in the belief that the former is considered to have a divine or supernatural essence that transcends human limitations, including mortality. In religious traditions where the concept of the "Son of God" is central, the eternal nature of this being is often emphasized as a fundamental aspect of their identity.

Human sons, on the other hand, are viewed as mortal beings with a finite existence. They are born, live their lives, and eventually pass away, in accordance with natural laws and biological processes. In this sense, the eternal nature attributed to the "Son of God" sets them apart from human beings in terms of their perceived divine status and existence beyond the confines of earthly life.

It's important to recognize that these distinctions are based on religious beliefs and interpretations of sacred texts, rather than on empirical evidence or scientific inquiry. As an atheistic scholar, my focus is on critical thinking and rational analysis, and I approach these concepts from a perspective that is free from religious dogma or supernatural beliefs.
