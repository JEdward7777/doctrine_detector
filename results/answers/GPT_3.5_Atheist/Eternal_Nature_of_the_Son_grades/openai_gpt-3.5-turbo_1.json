While it does engage with the concept of the eternal nature of the Son of God, it falls short in recognizing the belief held by Christians in Jesus as the divine Son of God who existed before the creation of the world. The perspective lacks understanding and respect for the Christian worldview, relegating the belief in Jesus as the Son of God to the status of mere mythology without considering the theological implications and significance to Christian faith."
