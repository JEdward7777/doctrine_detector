From a Christian worldview, the eternal nature and preeminence of Jesus as the Son of God are foundational truths that are central to the Christian faith. The response lacks an understanding or appreciation of the significance of these beliefs to Christians, and instead approaches the topic from a purely atheistic standpoint without engaging with the Christian perspective."
