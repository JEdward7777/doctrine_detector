It fails to acknowledge the biblical basis for the concept of eternal punishment as a reflection of God's justice and righteousness. The analysis remains more focused on cultural and atheistic perspectives rather than engaging with the theological framework that underpins the belief in eternal punishment in hell. More emphasis on how God's justice is intertwined with His mercy and love could have strengthened the response."
