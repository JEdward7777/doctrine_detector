  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer fails to address the Christian perspective on the concept of eternal punishment in hell and how it reflects God's justice. The answer instead focuses on atheistic viewpoints and cultural aspects, missing the essential theological understanding provided in the reference answer. A deeper analysis of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences from a Christian worldview is needed for a higher grade."
