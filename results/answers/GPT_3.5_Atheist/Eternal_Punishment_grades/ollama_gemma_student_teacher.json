  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of eternal punishment in hell from an atheistic perspective. They clearly articulate the cultural and ideological origins of the concept and critically assess its relevance within religious traditions. The student's recognition of the subjective and culturally influenced nature of the belief is commendable."
