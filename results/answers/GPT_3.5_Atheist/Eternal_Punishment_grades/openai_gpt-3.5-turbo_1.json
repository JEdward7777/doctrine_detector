However, it lacks a deeper examination of the Christian understanding of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. The response could benefit from addressing how the belief in hell as a consequence for rejecting Jesus' sacrifice relates to God's justice and mercy, as well as exploring the Biblical foundation for this belief."
