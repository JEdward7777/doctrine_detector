However, the response does not fully address the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences from a Christian worldview. It lacks an analysis of the Christian understanding of justice and mercy in the context of eternal punishment. Additional focus on how eternal consequences are seen as a part of God's character and the importance of accepting Jesus' sacrifice for salvation would strengthen the response."
