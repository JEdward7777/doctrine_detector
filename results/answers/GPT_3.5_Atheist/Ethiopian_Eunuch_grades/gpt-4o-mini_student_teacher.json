They accurately highlighted the significance of the encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch in showcasing Christianity's inclusivity, divine intervention, and transformative power. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by further emphasizing the specific significance of the Ethiopian eunuch's identity as a Gentile in relation to the broader theological implications of the early church's inclusivity towards outsiders."
