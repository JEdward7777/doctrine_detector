  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does a good job of explaining Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 and how it relates to the concept of celibacy. The writer provides some context about the history and practice of celibacy across different religious traditions, including Christianity. Additionally, they highlight how Jesus' words can be seen as a recognition of the validity of celibacy as a way to live a life dedicated to God.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response could benefit from more depth and analysis. For example, the writer could have explored the biblical reasons behind Jesus' words or discussed potential challenges and criticisms related to celibacy. The response is also somewhat generic and lacks specific examples or personal anecdotes to illustrate the concept of celibacy.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a good overview of the topic, it could be more nuanced and thoughtful in its exploration of the biblical perspective on celibacy and its different reasons for living a life without marriage."
