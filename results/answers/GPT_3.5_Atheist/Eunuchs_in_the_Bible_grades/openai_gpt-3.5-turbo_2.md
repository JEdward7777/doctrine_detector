## [Answer](../Eunuchs_in_the_Bible.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Matthew 19:12, Jesus refers to three types of eunuchs â€“ those who were born that way, those who were made that way by others, and those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The concept of celibacy can be related to this as those who choose to live like eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven are essentially choosing a life of celibacy for religious reasons.

Celibacy, or abstaining from marriage and sexual relations, has been practiced by various religious traditions as a way to dedicate oneself fully to spiritual pursuits. In the context of Christianity, celibacy is often associated with clergy members such as priests and nuns who choose to remain unmarried in order to focus on their service to God and the church.

The idea of living as a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven can be seen as a form of voluntary celibacy for the sake of spiritual devotion. By choosing not to marry or engage in sexual relations, individuals are able to fully commit themselves to their religious beliefs and practices.

Overall, Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 can be seen as a recognition of the validity of celibacy as a way to live a life dedicated to God and spiritual pursuits.
