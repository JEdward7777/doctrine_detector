  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of celibacy in relation to the biblical perspective on eunuchs as discussed in Matthew 19:12. It effectively connects the idea of living as a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven to voluntary celibacy for spiritual devotion within Christianity. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and effectively explores the different reasons for choosing a life without marriage."
