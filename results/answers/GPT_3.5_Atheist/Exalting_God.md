## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I do not personally believe in the existence of a deity or the concept of exalting God. However, I can provide an answer from a culturally retributed perspective.

In many religious traditions, exalting God in daily life typically involves showing reverence, praise, and obedience to a higher power. This can manifest in various ways such as prayer, worship, acts of kindness and service, following religious teachings, and living a moral and ethical life.

For individuals who believe in the existence of a deity, exalting God in daily life may be seen as a way to honor and show devotion to their faith. It can provide a sense of purpose, guidance, and connection to something greater than oneself.

Ultimately, the concept of exalting God in daily life is deeply personal and can vary greatly depending on one's religious beliefs and practices.
