  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of exalting God from a cultural and philosophical perspective. While they acknowledge their own atheism, they provide a comprehensive overview of the various ways people from religious traditions exalt God in their daily lives. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a more direct engagement with the concern of understanding the importance of exalting God above all else in life. Additionally, the student's answer does not explicitly address the Christian-specific worldview, as requested."
