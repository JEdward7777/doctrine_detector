  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the Parable of the Good Samaritan and its significance in teaching compassion and expanding the definition of neighbor. They effectively connected the lesson of the parable to the broader concept of showing kindness and empathy towards others, reflecting values of social justice and solidarity. The response could have been improved by directly citing the importance of love and compassion explicitly within the context of a Christian worldview, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher."
