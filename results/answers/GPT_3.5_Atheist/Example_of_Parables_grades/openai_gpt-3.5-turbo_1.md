# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly, one well-known parable told by Jesus is the Parable of the Good Samaritan, found in the Gospel of Luke. In this parable, a man is robbed, beaten, and left half-dead on the side of the road. Both a priest and a Levite pass by the wounded man without offering help, but a Samaritan stops to care for him, taking him to an inn and paying for his expenses.

The significance of this parable lies in the lesson it teaches about compassion and the definition of neighbor. Samaritans were despised by the Jewish community at the time, yet it was the Samaritan who showed kindness and mercy to the injured man. Through this parable, Jesus challenges his listeners to broaden their understanding of who their neighbor is and emphasizes the importance of showing compassion and love to everyone, regardless of social or cultural differences.

In a culturally retributed context, this parable illustrates the timeless moral principle of treating others with kindness and empathy, regardless of our differences or prejudices. It calls us to transcend societal norms and biases and to act with compassion and generosity towards all individuals in need, reflecting the values of social justice and solidarity.
