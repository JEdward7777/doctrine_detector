## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly. In the Bible, there are several instances where individuals are described as being possessed by demons. One well-known example is found in the Gospel of Mark, where Jesus encounters a man possessed by multiple demons in the region of the Gerasenes (Mark 5:1-20). The man lived among the tombs, was uncontrollable, and exhibited superhuman strength. Jesus then casts out the demons and restores the man to his right mind.

Another example is found in the Gospel of Matthew, where a man brings his son to Jesus, explaining that the boy is possessed by a demon that causes him to have seizures and suffer greatly (Matthew 17:14-20). Jesus rebukes the demon and heals the boy.

These examples illustrate the belief in demon possession as described in the Bible, where demons can take control of individuals and cause them harm.
