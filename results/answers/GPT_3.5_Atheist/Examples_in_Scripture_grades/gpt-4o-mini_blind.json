  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The answer effectively provides two examples from the Bible that illustrate instances of demon possession, referencing the accounts in the Gospels of Mark and Matthew. The explanation is clear and accurately describes the scenarios of demon possession and Jesus' subsequent actions in casting out the demons. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the student could have included a brief mention of the spiritual warfare aspect inherent in these instances of demon possession, highlighting the power and authority of Jesus over evil spirits. Overall, a solid response with room for a bit more depth in tying the examples back to broader theological themes."
