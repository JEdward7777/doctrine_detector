However, the student could have further explored the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith by drawing connections beyond just the specific examples provided. Encouraging the student to dive deeper into the broader implications of these spiritual issues would strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
