  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided solid examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt, specifically referencing the stories of Adam and Eve as well as King David. The explanation was clear and accurately portrayed how guilt is manifested in these biblical narratives. The response effectively communicated the idea that guilt is a significant theme in the Bible and highlighted the fallibility of even revered figures when it comes to moral failings. However, to enhance the answer, it could have further emphasized the consequences of guilt and the importance of seeking forgiveness and redemption in the context of Christian teachings."
