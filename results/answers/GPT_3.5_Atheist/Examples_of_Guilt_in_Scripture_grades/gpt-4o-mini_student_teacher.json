  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided strong examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt, specifically highlighting the stories of Adam and Eve and King David. The examples are relevant and well-explained, showing an understanding of how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence. However, the student could have included a more direct connection to the need for divine judgment in their analysis to fully address the concern provided."
