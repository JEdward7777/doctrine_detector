  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid analysis of biblical examples that demonstrate the concept of guilt and how it operates in the context of justice and innocence. The examples of Adam and Eve, King David, Pilate declaring Jesus innocent, and the robber acknowledging guilt compared to Jesus all effectively illustrate the theme of guilt in the Bible and the need for divine judgment. The response effectively connects the examples to the concern provided, though some additional explanation or expansion on the connections between guilt, justice, innocence, and divine judgment could further enhance the response."
