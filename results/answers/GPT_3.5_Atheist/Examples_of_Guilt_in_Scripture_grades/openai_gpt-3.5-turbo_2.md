## Question [Examples of Guilt in Scripture](../../../questions/Examples_of_Guilt_in_Scripture.md)
What are some examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Pilate declaring Jesus innocent despite the accusations and the robber acknowledging their own guilt compared to Jesus in Luke 23:41.

## Stated Concern
These examples help us understand how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment.

## [Answer](../Examples_of_Guilt_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
One example from the Bible that demonstrates the concept of guilt is the story of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis. In this story, Adam and Eve disobey God by eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, despite being commanded not to do so. After eating the fruit, they feel guilt and shame, leading them to try and hide from God.

Another example is the story of King David in the Book of 2 Samuel. David commits adultery with Bathsheba and then arranges for her husband Uriah to be killed in battle to cover up his sin. When confronted by the prophet Nathan, David acknowledges his guilt and repents for his actions.

These examples illustrate how guilt is a prominent theme in the Bible, showing that even biblical figures considered to be righteous or favored by God are not immune to feelings of guilt when they commit wrongdoing.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a solid analysis of biblical examples that demonstrate the concept of guilt and how it operates in the context of justice and innocence. The examples of Adam and Eve, King David, Pilate declaring Jesus innocent, and the robber acknowledging guilt compared to Jesus all effectively illustrate the theme of guilt in the Bible and the need for divine judgment. The response effectively connects the examples to the concern provided, though some additional explanation or expansion on the connections between guilt, justice, innocence, and divine judgment could further enhance the response.
