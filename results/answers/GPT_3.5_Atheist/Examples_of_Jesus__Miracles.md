## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Certainly. As an atheistic scholar, I approach the question about miracles attributed to Jesus from a non-religious perspective. It is important to remember that the accounts of these miracles are found in religious texts and are viewed as matters of faith for believers.

Some of the miracles attributed to Jesus include:

1. Healing the sick: Jesus is said to have healed many individuals suffering from various illnesses and disabilities. This was significant as it demonstrated his compassion and divine power.

2. Feeding the 5,000: Jesus is said to have miraculously multiplied a small amount of food to feed a large crowd of people. This signified his ability to provide for the physical needs of his followers.

3. Walking on water: Jesus is said to have defied the laws of nature by walking on water. This act symbolized his power over the elements and his ability to inspire faith in his disciples.

4. Raising the dead: Jesus is said to have brought several individuals back to life, including Lazarus. These miracles were seen as powerful displays of his authority over life and death.

For believers, these miracles serve as evidence of Jesus' divinity and reinforce the teachings of Christianity. However, from a scholarly and non-religious perspective, these miracles are seen as part of the religious narrative surrounding Jesus and are viewed with skepticism due to the lack of empirical evidence.
