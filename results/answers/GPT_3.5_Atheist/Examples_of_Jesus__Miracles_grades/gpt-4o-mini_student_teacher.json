  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough list of miracles attributed to Jesus and their significance, highlighting their importance in demonstrating Jesus' compassion, divine power, provision, ability to inspire faith, and authority over life and death. However, the student's perspective as an atheistic scholar and the skepticism towards the miracles from a non-religious viewpoint detract from acknowledging the miracles as signs of Jesus' divinity and God's kingdom. Emphasizing the significance of these miracles in reinforcing the belief in Jesus as the Son of God would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview."
