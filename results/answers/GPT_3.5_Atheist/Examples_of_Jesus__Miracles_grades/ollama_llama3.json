  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 40.\n\nWhile the response does mention some of the miracles attributed to Jesus, such as healing the sick, feeding the 5,000, walking on water, and raising the dead, it falls short in several areas. Firstly, it lacks specificity and detail about these miracles, unlike the original answer which mentions calming a storm, healing a blind man, and raising people from the dead. Secondly, the response focuses more on the secular perspective of the miracles, viewing them with skepticism due to lack of empirical evidence, rather than exploring their significance in the believer's life.\n\nThe concern is also not well-addressed in this response. While it mentions that the miracles serve as evidence of Jesus' divinity and reinforce the teachings of Christianity, it does not delve deeper into how these miracles help in our belief in Him as the Son of God.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest providing more specific examples of Jesus' miracles, exploring their significance in the believer's life, and demonstrating a clear understanding of how these miracles can strengthen one's faith in Jesus as the Son of God."
