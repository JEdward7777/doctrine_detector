However, it falls short in fully recognizing the importance of Jesus' miracles in strengthening belief in Him as the Son of God. From a Christian worldview, Jesus' miracles are not just symbolic acts, but they are concrete manifestations of His divine nature and authority, meant to reveal His identity as the Messiah and Son of God. The response should have emphasized this theological aspect more strongly to align with a Christian perspective."
