However, the response falls short in addressing the concern raised about the significance of Jesus' miracles in reinforcing belief in Him as the Son of God from a Christian worldview. It does not engage with the idea that these miracles are signs of Jesus' divinity and God's kingdom, which is crucial for believers in understanding and accepting Jesus as the Son of God."
