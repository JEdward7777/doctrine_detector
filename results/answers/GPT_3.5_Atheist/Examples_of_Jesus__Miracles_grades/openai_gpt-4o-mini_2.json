The response effectively highlights the role of miracles in reinforcing Christian faith and understanding of Jesus' identity. However, it falls slightly short as it restricts the analysis to a scholarly and non-religious perspective, missing the opportunity to delve deeper into the spiritual implications of these miracles from a Christian worldview."
