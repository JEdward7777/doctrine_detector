  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response at 80.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between trust and faith in the context of Christian belief, they have included additional information beyond the given answer. The student did a good job connecting trust as the foundation upon which faith is built, but the response could have been strengthened by focusing more on the direct relationship between trust and faith as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept but could benefit from more alignment with the specific concern provided."
