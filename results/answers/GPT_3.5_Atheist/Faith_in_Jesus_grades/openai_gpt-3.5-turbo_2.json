However, the response could have further highlighted the transformative implications of this belief on personal life, such as how faith in Jesus impacts one's values, decisions, relationships, and overall worldview. An explicitly Christian worldview would have deepened the discussion on how faith in Jesus influences every aspect of a believer's life."
