  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer does not address the concern of recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life. While the student provides insight on how faith in Jesus can manifest culturally and personally, they do not reference the role of the Holy Spirit or the spiritual fruits that should result from true faith. From a Christian worldview, true faith in Jesus should produce tangible evidence in a person's life, reflecting the presence of the Holy Spirit. The student's response lacks this important theological perspective."
