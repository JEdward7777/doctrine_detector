While the response does discuss manifestations of faith in daily life, it lacks consideration for the foundational Christian principle that true faith in Jesus is empowered by the presence of the Holy Spirit. A Christian worldview would emphasize the importance of the inner transformation brought about by the Holy Spirit in recognizing genuine faith."
