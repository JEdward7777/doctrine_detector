While the response acknowledges manifestations of faith, it does not attribute them to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, a crucial aspect in Christian belief. Additionally, the focus on cultural and sociological perspectives disregards the central role of supernatural transformation in authentic faith according to Christian teachings.\n"
