## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Bible teaches that marriage is a sacred covenant between two individuals and that faithfulness is of utmost importance within this covenant. Adultery, which is the act of being unfaithful to one's spouse by engaging in a sexual relationship with someone outside of the marriage, is explicitly condemned in the Bible. 

In the Old Testament, adultery is listed as one of the Ten Commandments: "You shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14). Throughout the Bible, there are numerous verses that emphasize the importance of fidelity in marriage and the consequences of adultery.

For example, Proverbs 6:32-33 states, "But a man who commits adultery has no sense; whoever does so destroys himself. Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away."

In the New Testament, Jesus also speaks about the seriousness of adultery. In Matthew 5:27-28, he says, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

Overall, the Bible teaches that faithfulness in marriage is essential and that adultery is a betrayal of the marital covenant. It is considered a sin with serious consequences, both in this life and potentially in the afterlife.
