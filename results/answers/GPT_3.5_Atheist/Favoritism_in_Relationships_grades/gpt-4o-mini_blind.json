  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 85. \n\nThe student correctly identifies and explains the term \"favoritism\" from a general perspective and provides detailed insight into how favoritism can negatively impact relationships. The answer highlights the emotions and consequences associated with favoritism in personal and professional settings.\n\nHowever, from a Christian worldview perspective, it would have been beneficial for the student to also include the biblical perspective on favoritism. In the Bible, favoritism is viewed as contrary to the principles of love, justice, and equality that Christians are called to uphold. Verses such as James 2:1-4 warn against showing favoritism and emphasize the importance of treating others with equal respect and fairness.\n\nIncluding this perspective would have strengthened the answer and provided a more comprehensive understanding of favoritism in relation to Christian beliefs."
