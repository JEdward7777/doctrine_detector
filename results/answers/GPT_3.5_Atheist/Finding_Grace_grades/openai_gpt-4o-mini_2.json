From a Christian worldview, the concept of finding grace in the eyes of God goes beyond self-acceptance and personal fulfillment to encompass a relationship with a divine being and acknowledging His mercy and favor. The response should have integrated elements of seeking and recognizing God's favor within the context of Christian beliefs."
