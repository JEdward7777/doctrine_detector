The metaphorical approach is appropriate in a modern setting where inheritance rights are less relevant. However, the answer could be strengthened by including specific biblical references or examples to deepen the theological foundation of the interpretation. Additionally, connecting the concept of birthright to the broader narrative of salvation history in Christianity would enhance the depth of the analysis."
