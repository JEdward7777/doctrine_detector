  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful interpretation of the concept of birthright in a Christian family context, emphasizing spiritual values and teachings passed down through generations. While the response lacks the explicit connection to leading the family in faith and demonstrating God's blessings through stewardship and inheritance as indicated in the reference answer, it effectively conveys the symbolic and spiritual significance of the birthright within a Christian family setting."
