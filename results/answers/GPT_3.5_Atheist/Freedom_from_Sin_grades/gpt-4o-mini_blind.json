However, it lacks a deeper theological analysis of the consequences of sin and the necessity of Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of freedom from sin. Including more emphasis on the atoning sacrifice of Jesus and the need for faith in Him for true liberation from sin would strengthen the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
