  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded answer that addresses the negative impacts of being bound by sin on a Christian's relationship with God. They highlighted the feelings of guilt, shame, and distance from God that can result from sin. The response also offers practical steps for finding freedom from these bonds, such as self-reflection, repentance, and building a stronger relationship with God through prayer and scripture. However, the student could have emphasized the importance of faith in Jesus as the ultimate source of freedom from sin, as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, the student effectively encourages believers to address sin for a deeper relationship with God, aligning with the specified concern."
