The fruits of the Holy Spirit are specifically Christian virtues that are bestowed upon believers by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, discussing them solely from a secular perspective misses the crucial theological aspect. The answer could be improved by acknowledging the Christian origins of these qualities and demonstrating an understanding of their spiritual significance within the Christian faith."
