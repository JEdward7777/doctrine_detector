From a Christian perspective, it is crucial to recognize that these virtues are not merely universal moral principles but are specifically tied to the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer. The response lacks the depth of understanding and connection to the Christian worldview in discussing the fruits of the Holy Spirit."
