However, from a Christian perspective, the response falls short in fully recognizing the source and significance of these virtues as being rooted in a relationship with God and essential for spiritual growth and reflecting Christ-like character. While the secular perspective on moral and ethical principles is appreciated, a deeper exploration of the theological framework and spiritual aspect of these virtues would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview."
