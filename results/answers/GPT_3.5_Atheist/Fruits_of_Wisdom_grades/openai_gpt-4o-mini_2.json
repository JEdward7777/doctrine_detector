While the secular perspective on the universal value of these virtues is acknowledged, there is a lack of emphasis on the importance of these virtues in spiritual growth and reflecting Christ-like character, which is a key concern from a Christian worldview. Encouraging the integration of these virtues with faith and relationship with God would align more closely with the Christian perspective on the fruits of the Holy Spirit."
