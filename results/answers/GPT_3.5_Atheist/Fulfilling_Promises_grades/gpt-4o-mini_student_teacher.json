  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and detailed explanation of the importance of fulfilling promises or vows before God from a Christian perspective. They referenced relevant biblical teachings and highlighted the significance of integrity, trust, and obedience to God in keeping one's word. The answer effectively addresses the concern raised and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. The grade is slightly lower than the reference answer as there could have been a stronger emphasis on the direct impact on one's faith in failing to keep promises made before God."
