However, to more fully address the concern of understanding how God interacts with prophecy and its realization in Scripture from a Christian perspective, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of divine intervention in fulfilling prophecies. A stronger connection to the Christian worldview regarding God's sovereignty and involvement in prophecy fulfillment would have strengthened the response."
