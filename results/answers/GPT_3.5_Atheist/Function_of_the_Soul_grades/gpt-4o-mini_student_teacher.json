  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a strong analysis of the figurative language surrounding the concept of \"soul\" in the Bible, linking it to human identity and emphasizing introspection and moral development. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples of figurative uses of 'soul' in the Bible to support the points made. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a biblical perspective."
