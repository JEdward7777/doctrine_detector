  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 70. \n\nWhile the answer acknowledges the possibility of a broader understanding of \"holy place\" beyond traditional religious spaces and provides some examples to support this perspective, it falls short in addressing the concept from a Christian-specific worldview. The answer does not delve into the biblical teachings on holiness, the Christian understanding of sacred spaces, or the theological implications of expanding the definition of \"holy place.\" To improve, the student could have integrated Christian doctrines and scriptures to present a more comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation."
