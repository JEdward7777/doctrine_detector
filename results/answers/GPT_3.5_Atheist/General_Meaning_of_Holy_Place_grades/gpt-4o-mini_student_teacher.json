  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated answer that explores different perspectives on what could constitute a \"holy place\" beyond traditional religious structures. However, from a Christian worldview, the primary understanding of a \"holy place\" is one that is set apart for God and dedicated to worship. The student's response, while insightful in discussing secular interpretations of holy places, lacks a clear connection to the Christian perspective outlined in the reference answer. Thus, the grade reflects the need for a stronger alignment with the specific concern provided."
