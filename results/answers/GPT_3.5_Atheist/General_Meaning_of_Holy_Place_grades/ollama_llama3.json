The concern was to identify places that are dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter, but the response only touches on this briefly by mentioning natural landscapes, historical sites, and art installations being considered \"holy places\". To improve, the response could have explicitly linked these examples to their potential for spiritual connection and worship, making it more relevant to the concern."
