While the secular perspective is informative, it does not fully address the concern of identifying places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter from a Christian worldview. The response lacks specific references to God or worship, which are central elements in a Christian understanding of holy places. Integrating more Christian-specific perspectives and emphasizing the importance of spiritual connection with God would strengthen the response."
