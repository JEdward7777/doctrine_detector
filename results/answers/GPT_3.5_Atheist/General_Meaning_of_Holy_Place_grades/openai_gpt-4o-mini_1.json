From a Christian worldview, there is a concern that this response dilutes the unique and sacred nature of places designated for spiritual significance and divine encounter as specifically related to God. This response needs to emphasize more on how the Christian concept of holy places is distinct from secular or culturally relative ideas to align better with a Christian worldview."
