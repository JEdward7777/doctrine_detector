## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
An evangelist is a specific type of Christian who is dedicated to spreading the teachings of Christianity and attempting to convert others to the faith. While all Christians are called to share their beliefs with others, evangelists typically have a particular passion and dedication for this aspect of their faith. They often engage in activities such as preaching, distributing religious literature, and participating in missionary work with the goal of bringing more people into the Christian faith.

It is important to note that not all Christians identify as evangelists, and there are many different ways to practice and express one's faith within Christianity. Some Christians may prioritize other aspects of their faith such as charity work, social justice advocacy, or personal spiritual growth. So, while evangelists have a specific focus on spreading the Christian message, they are just one subset of the diverse Christian community.
