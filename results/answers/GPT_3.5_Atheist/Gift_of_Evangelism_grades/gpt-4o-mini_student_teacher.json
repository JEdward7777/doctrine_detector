  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student does provide a general description of what distinguishes an evangelist from other Christians by highlighting their dedication to spreading the teachings of Christianity and converting others, there is a lack of emphasis on the spiritual gifts related to evangelism in the Church. The student's answer does not explicitly mention the spiritual gift of evangelism and its significance in shaping an individual as an evangelist, which is a key aspect when understanding the distinction between evangelists and other Christians from a Christian worldview.\n\nThe student should have connected the role of spiritual gifts, specifically the gift of evangelism, to the defining characteristics of an evangelist in order to fully address the concern provided."
