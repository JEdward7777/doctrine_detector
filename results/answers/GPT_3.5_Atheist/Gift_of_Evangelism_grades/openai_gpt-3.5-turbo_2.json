It correctly emphasizes the role of spiritual gifts in the church and how evangelists are specifically equipped for this task. The response could have been improved by further elaborating on the biblical basis for spiritual gifts, such as referencing passages like 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4. Overall, a solid explanation from a Christian worldview."
