It appropriately acknowledges that not all Christians are called to be evangelists and highlights the diversity of expressions within the Christian community. The response could be improved by incorporating more directly Christian theological concepts related to evangelism and spiritual gifts, such as referencing biblical passages like Ephesians 4:11-12."
