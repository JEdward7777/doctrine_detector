  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer falls short of addressing the concern of emphasizing the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness. The response focuses more on cultural and general perspectives rather than specifically addressing ways to actively glorify God. It lacks a Christian worldview perspective and does not align with the reference answer provided."
