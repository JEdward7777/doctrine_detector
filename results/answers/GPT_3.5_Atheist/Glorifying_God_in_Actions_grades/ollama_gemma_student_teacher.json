  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer addresses the concern by highlighting ways a believer can demonstrate reverence and gratitude towards God through their actions and practices. However, it lacks the specific emphasis on sharing testimonies and living according to God's character and commandments as outlined in the reference answer. The student's cultural perspective approach provides a broader understanding of glorify God but fails to capture the essence of reflecting God's glory through personal transformation and obedience."
