# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of a 'remnant' can be seen as indicating God's selective grace towards His people in a culturally retributed way. In many religious narratives, a 'remnant' refers to a small group of faithful individuals who are spared from destruction or punishment because of their devotion to God and adherence to His commands. This idea suggests that God rewards those who remain steadfast in their faith and righteousness, while others are left to face the consequences of their actions.

The notion of a 'remnant' can also be interpreted as a form of divine justice, where those who have strayed from the path of righteousness are not shown the same level of favor or protection as the faithful. This can be seen as a reflection of the belief that God rewards those who align themselves with His will and punishes those who defy it.

Overall, the concept of a 'remnant' underscores the idea of God's selective grace towards His people, highlighting the importance of faithfulness and obedience in receiving divine favor. It serves as a reminder that God's blessings are not indiscriminately bestowed, but are reserved for those who demonstrate their loyalty and devotion.
