  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the passage from Matthew 19:17 as a reference to the goodness and perfection of God, which aligns with the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. The explanation that Jesus is emphasizing the supremacy and moral perfection of God in comparison to human beings also demonstrates an understanding of the Christian worldview.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have dug deeper into the biblical context and explored how this statement relates to other passages in Scripture that discuss God's nature and character. Nevertheless, the response provides a clear and concise explanation of Jesus' statement and its significance within the Christian belief system.\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the source of goodness as God himself, emphasizing His moral perfection and righteousness. A score of 90 reflects the response's overall strength in accurately interpreting the biblical passage and applying it to the concern."
