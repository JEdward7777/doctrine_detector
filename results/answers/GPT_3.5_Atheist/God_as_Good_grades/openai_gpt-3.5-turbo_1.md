## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the context of the Christian belief system, this statement made by Jesus in the Bible, particularly in the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 19:17), is seen as a reference to the belief in the goodness and perfection of God as the ultimate source of all that is good. Jesus, being a central figure in Christian theology, is often believed to be the son of God and as such, aligning himself with the goodness and perfection of God. Therefore, when he states that there is only one who is good, and that is God, he is emphasizing the supremacy and moral perfection of God in comparison to human beings. This statement reinforces the idea of God as the ultimate standard of goodness in the Christian worldview.
