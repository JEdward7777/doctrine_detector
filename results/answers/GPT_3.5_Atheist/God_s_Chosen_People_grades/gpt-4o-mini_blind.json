  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The answer provides a general understanding of the concept of a 'remnant' and how it can indicate God's selective grace towards His people. However, the response lacks depth in connecting this concept to specific biblical examples or teachings. To improve the grade, the student could have supported their points with references to scripture and provided a more nuanced analysis rooted in Christian theology. Additionally, the explanation could have been clearer and more precise in articulating the relationship between God's grace, faithfulness, and divine justice."
