  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provides a decent explanation of the concept of a 'remnant' and its association with divine favor, the answer is lacking in specificity and depth compared to the reference answer. The student's response could be enhanced by directly connecting the idea of God's selective grace with the concept of the 'remnant' and emphasizing the significance of being chosen by God. Additionally, incorporating more Biblical references or theological insights would strengthen the argument from a Christian perspective."
