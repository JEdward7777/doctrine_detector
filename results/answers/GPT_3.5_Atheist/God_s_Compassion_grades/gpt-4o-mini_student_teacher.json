  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a solid overview of how the Bible portrays God's compassionate nature, citing relevant examples from both the Old and New Testaments. They effectively connected God's compassion to divine love and mercy. The student demonstrated a clear understanding of the relationship between God's compassion and the overall theme of divine love and mercy in the Bible. The grade is slightly lower than perfect as they could have delved deeper into specific examples or theological implications to strengthen their response further."
