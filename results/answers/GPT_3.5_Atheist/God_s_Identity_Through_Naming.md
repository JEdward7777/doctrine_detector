## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of being 'called by my name' in relation to our relationship with God can be understood as a symbolic expression of a personal and intimate bond between an individual and their deity. In ancient cultures, naming was believed to contain power and significance, and being called by a specific name signified a special connection and purpose.

In the context of monotheistic religions like Christianity, being 'called by my name' can be seen as God's recognition and acknowledgment of an individual, indicating a chosen status and a unique destiny. It implies a close and personal relationship with the divine, where the individual is known and valued at a deep level.

From an atheistic perspective, this concept can be interpreted as a cultural and psychological phenomenon, reflecting human longing for meaning, belonging, and significance. The idea of being 'called by my name' may serve as a metaphor for self-discovery, personal growth, and finding one's place in the world.

Ultimately, whether viewed through a religious or secular lens, the concept of being 'called by my name' highlights the innate human desire for connection, purpose, and identity in the universe.
