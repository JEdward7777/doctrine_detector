However, the answer lacks depth in exploring the theological significance within a Christian worldview. It does not delve into the biblical basis of the concept or expound on the intimate nature of God's relationship with His people. Additionally, the answer could benefit from incorporating scriptural references to support the theological implications of being 'called by my name' in Christianity."
