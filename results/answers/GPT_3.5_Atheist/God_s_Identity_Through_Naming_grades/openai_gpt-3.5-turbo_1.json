It addresses the concern by discussing the implications of identity and belonging to God in a Christian's life. However, the inclusion of perspectives from atheism and secular views detracts slightly from a purely Christian worldview focus. It could have gone deeper into the specific implications for a Christian believer's identity and belonging to God to enhance the analysis further."
