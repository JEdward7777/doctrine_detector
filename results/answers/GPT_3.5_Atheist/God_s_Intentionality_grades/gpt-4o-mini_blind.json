The answer could further strengthen its doctrinal correctness by directly referencing biblical examples of God's calling and incorporating relevant Scripture passages to support the points made. Additionally, connecting the concept of God's calling to core Christian beliefs such as predestination and divine providence would enhance the depth of the response."
