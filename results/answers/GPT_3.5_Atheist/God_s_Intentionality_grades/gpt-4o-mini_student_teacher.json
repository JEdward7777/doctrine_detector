  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has a strong grasp of the significance of using the term 'call' in relation to God's actions, emphasizing intentionality and purpose. The response effectively communicates the idea that God's calling is intentional and purposeful, highlighting the idea of a personal relationship between God and individuals. The student provides a clear explanation supported by relevant points, aligning well with the Christian worldview concern provided. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of intentional calling with fulfilling a specific role in God's divine plan, as noted in the reference answer."
