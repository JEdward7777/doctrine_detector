  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a generally accurate explanation of God's jealousy in the Bible from a cultural and historical perspective. However, the answer lacks depth in exploring the theological significance of God's jealousy within the Christian worldview. It fails to emphasize God's righteous and justified jealousy in maintaining His exclusive relationship with His people. More scriptural references and theological insights could have been included to provide a more robust understanding of this attribute of God."
