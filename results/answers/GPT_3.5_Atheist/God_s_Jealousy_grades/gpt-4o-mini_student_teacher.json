  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a fairly good explanation of God's jealousy in the Bible, emphasizing the importance of loyalty and worship. However, the response could have delved deeper into God's character and His desire for spiritual fidelity, as well as focused more specifically on the covenant relationship between God and His people. Additionally, there is room for improvement in connecting the concept of God's jealousy to the broader understanding of His divine nature and how it relates to human relationships."
