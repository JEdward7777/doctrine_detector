  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical concept of God's jealousy and its theological significance within monotheistic religions. The student provides a nuanced analysis, differentiating between human emotions and God's jealousy. Additionally, the student offers insights into the cultural and ideological contexts in which the concept of God's jealousy is presented in the biblical texts. However, the answer would benefit from further elaboration on the specific biblical passages that support the idea of God's jealousy and their relevance to the theme of spiritual fidelity."
