  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian doctrine of justification as the act of God declaring a sinner righteous. However, the student's rejection of the existence of God undermines the core premise of the question and the specified concern. The lack of belief in God's existence limits the scope and relevance of the answer within the Christian worldview."
