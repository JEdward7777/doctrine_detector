The concern about believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling is not addressed, as the response instead emphasizes human-centered approaches to navigating life. While the response may offer some practical advice on goal-setting and self-awareness, its underlying assumption that humans are solely responsible for shaping their own destinies lacks a biblical perspective. As such, it does not adequately address the concern of believers feeling uncertain about their purpose or calling."
