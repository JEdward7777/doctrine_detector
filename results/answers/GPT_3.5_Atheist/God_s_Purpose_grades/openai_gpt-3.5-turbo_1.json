From a Christian worldview, individuals believe in the existence of a higher power who has a plan for each person's life. The atheistic scholar's viewpoint dismisses the idea of divine guidance and purpose, which contradicts the core beliefs of Christianity. Believers may indeed feel lost at times, but seeking God through prayer, scripture, and Christian community is fundamental to finding clarity and direction in their purpose."
