## [Answer](../God_s_Revelation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, God introduces Himself using different names that reflect different aspects of His nature and character. One of the most well-known names for God is "Yahweh," which is often translated as "I am who I am" or "I am that I am." This name emphasizes God's eternal and unchanging nature. Another common name for God in the Bible is "Elohim," which highlights His power and authority as the creator of the universe. Additionally, God is referred to as "Adonai," which conveys His lordship and sovereignty over all things. These names and others used in the Bible serve to reveal different facets of God's identity and help us understand His role in the world.
