## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In atheistic terms, the concept of being "born again" typically refers to a spiritual or religious experience where an individual undergoes a profound personal transformation or renewal. This often involves adopting a new set of beliefs, values, or worldview.

From an atheistic perspective, this process is typically understood as a deeply personal and psychological experience rather than one directed or influenced by a divine being or deity. The idea of being "born again" can be seen as a natural part of human development and growth, influenced by a combination of internal reflection, external circumstances, social interactions, and personal choices.

In this context, the role of any traditional notion of God or divine intervention in the process of being "born again" would not be considered a factor. Instead, individuals may undergo personal growth, self-discovery, and transformation through their own agency, experiences, and reflections on the world around them.
