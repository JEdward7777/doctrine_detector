  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the atheistic perspective on the concept of being \"born again.\" However, it fails to acknowledge the Christian belief in divine intervention in the process of salvation. While the student's explanation of the psychological and social factors influencing personal growth is insightful, it does not align with the Christian worldview which emphasizes the role of God's sovereignty and grace in salvation."
