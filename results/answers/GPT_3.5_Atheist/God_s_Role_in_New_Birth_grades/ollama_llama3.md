## [Answer](../God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In atheistic terms, the concept of being "born again" typically refers to a spiritual or religious experience where an individual undergoes a profound personal transformation or renewal. This often involves adopting a new set of beliefs, values, or worldview.

From an atheistic perspective, this process is typically understood as a deeply personal and psychological experience rather than one directed or influenced by a divine being or deity. The idea of being "born again" can be seen as a natural part of human development and growth, influenced by a combination of internal reflection, external circumstances, social interactions, and personal choices.

In this context, the role of any traditional notion of God or divine intervention in the process of being "born again" would not be considered a factor. Instead, individuals may undergo personal growth, self-discovery, and transformation through their own agency, experiences, and reflections on the world around them.

20.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 20.

This response does not adequately address the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation, as it primarily focuses on an atheistic perspective and describes being "born again" as a natural part of human development and growth. The provided answer emphasizes the importance of divine initiative and God's work in causing new birth, which is directly relevant to the concern. In contrast, this response does not acknowledge or address this aspect, instead presenting a secular view that diminishes the role of God.

Comment: While this response provides a thoughtful and nuanced discussion on being "born again" from an atheistic perspective, it falls short in addressing the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation. To receive a higher grade, the response would need to incorporate and address the provided answer's emphasis on divine initiative and God's work in causing new birth.
