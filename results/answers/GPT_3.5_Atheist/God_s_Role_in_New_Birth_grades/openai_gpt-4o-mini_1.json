  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided completely disregards the Christian worldview which emphasizes God's role in the process of being \"born again\" and salvation. It fails to acknowledge the central belief of divine initiative and sovereignty in the new birth. A Christian-specific worldview would expect a response that acknowledges and emphasizes God's role in this process."
