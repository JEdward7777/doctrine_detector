  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided completely overlooks the Christian perspective on being \"born again\" as a spiritual rebirth initiated by God's grace. The atheistic perspective presented does not align with the Christian worldview that emphasizes the need for divine intervention in the process of salvation. The student failed to address the concern regarding God's sovereignty and grace, resulting in a low grade."
