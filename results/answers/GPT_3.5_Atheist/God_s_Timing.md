## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I do not personally believe in the existence of a deity or a predetermined plan set by a higher power. However, I can understand how the concept of an "appointed time" can provide comfort and assurance to those who adhere to religious beliefs.

For believers, the idea of an appointed time implies that events unfold according to a divine schedule or plan, orchestrated by a higher power. This can be a source of solace during challenging times, as it suggests that there is a purpose and meaning behind life's circumstances.

By understanding and accepting the concept of appointed time, individuals may find reassurance in the belief that everything happens for a reason and that there is a larger plan at work beyond their control. This can help strengthen their faith in God's wisdom and guidance, providing a sense of peace and trust in the unfolding of events.

Ultimately, faith is a deeply personal and subjective experience, and individuals may find different ways to interpret and derive meaning from concepts such as appointed time. Whether or not one believes in a divine plan, finding purpose and comfort in one's beliefs can be a powerful source of support and resilience in navigating life's challenges.
