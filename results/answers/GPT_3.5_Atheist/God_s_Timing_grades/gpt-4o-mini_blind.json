From a Christian worldview, the absence of belief in a higher power and a predetermined plan would significantly impact the interpretation of this concept. The response could improve by discussing how the concept of 'appointed time' aligns with biblical teachings on God's sovereignty, providence, and purpose for His creation, and how this understanding can deepen one's trust and faith in God's plans."
