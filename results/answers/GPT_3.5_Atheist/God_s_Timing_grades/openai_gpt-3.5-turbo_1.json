It effectively addressed the concern by discussing how the concept of appointed time can impact our expectations in life, particularly in finding purpose and comfort in God's plan. However, from a Christian worldview, the response could have delved deeper into how our expectations should align with God's timing and trust in His perfect plan, emphasizing the importance of surrendering our desires to His will."
