During the 'day of Yahweh', God's punishment is often described in various ancient texts as a form of divine retribution or judgment against those who have committed sins or disobeyed his commandments. In some accounts, this punishment is depicted as a display of God's wrath, bringing destruction and suffering upon the wicked.
