However, the majority of the response focuses on the cultural and historical context of such depictions within ancient texts, without directly addressing the concern of the nature of God's judgment and the consequences for disbelief from a Christian worldview. There is a lack of engagement with the spiritual significance of God's judgment and how it relates to faith in God. Incorporating more of a Christian perspective would strengthen the response."
