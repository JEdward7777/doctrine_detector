However, the response focused more on the atheistic perspective and historical context of ancient texts, rather than directly addressing the concern of recognizing the nature of God's judgment and the consequences for disbelief. To better align with the concern, a more explicit connection between God's punishment and the consequences for disbelief could be drawn."
