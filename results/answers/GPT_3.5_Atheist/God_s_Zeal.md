## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In a culturally retributive context, the term "zeal of the Lord" reflects God's actions towards His people as being justly passionate and fierce in response to their obedience or disobedience. When the people follow God's commandments and live in alignment with His will, the zeal of the Lord is seen as a protective and benevolent force that rewards them with blessings and prosperity.

Conversely, when the people turn away from God and engage in sinful behavior, the zeal of the Lord manifests as a retributive force that brings about punishment and consequences for their actions. This concept emphasizes the idea that God's judgment is just and that His actions are a direct result of the choices made by His people.
