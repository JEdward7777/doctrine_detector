  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student does a good job in explaining the term \"zeal of the Lord\" in a culturally retributive context, connecting it to God's actions towards His people based on their obedience or disobedience. They emphasize the just nature of God's responses and how His actions align with the choices made by His people. However, the explanation could have been strengthened by including more biblical references or passages that explicitly speak about God's zeal and its effects on His people. This would have provided a more solid doctrinal foundation for the answer. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper biblical exploration."
