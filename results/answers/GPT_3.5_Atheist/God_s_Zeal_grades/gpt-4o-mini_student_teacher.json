They effectively touch on the consequences of the people's behavior. However, the student's answer could be improved by incorporating more emphasis on God's persistent efforts to bless His people and ensure justice, as mentioned in the reference answer. A stronger connection to the concern of deepening believers' trust in God's commitment to their well-being would enhance the response."
