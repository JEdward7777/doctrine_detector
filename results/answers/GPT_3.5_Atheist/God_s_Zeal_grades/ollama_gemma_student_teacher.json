  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of \"zeal of the Lord\" within a Christian worldview. It accurately explains that the zeal of the Lord is both passionate and just, and that its manifestation depends on the obedience or disobedience of the people. The student also correctly connects the concept of God's zeal to the ideas of blessing and punishment. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the idea of God's love as the driving force behind his zeal."
