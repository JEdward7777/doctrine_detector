  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Biblical definition of 'godliness' as encompassing righteousness, piety, and devotion to God. They effectively explain how this translates to following moral principles, adhering to religious practices, and demonstrating specific virtues. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on how to **concretely** incorporate godliness into daily life and actions. The student's mention of spiritual growth and enlightenment is important, but further elaboration on practical steps or examples would enhance the response."
