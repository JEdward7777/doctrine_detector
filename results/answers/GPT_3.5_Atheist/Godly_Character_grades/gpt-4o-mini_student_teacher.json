  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student explored different perspectives on virtues and character qualities, they did not directly address the question regarding the fruits of the Holy Spirit that indicate godly character. From a Christian perspective, the essential fruits of the Holy Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, and self-control, as outlined in the reference answer. The student's emphasis on secular and cultural viewpoints, while informative, did not align with the Christian worldview concerning the specific question asked."
