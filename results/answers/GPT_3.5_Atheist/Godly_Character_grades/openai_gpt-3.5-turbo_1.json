From a Christian perspective, the fruits of the Holy Spirit represent more than just cultural norms or personal beliefs - they are seen as essential qualities that reflect a godly individual guided by the Holy Spirit. While it acknowledges the Christian perspective, it doesn't emphasize the importance of cultivating these specific attributes in alignment with Christian teachings."
