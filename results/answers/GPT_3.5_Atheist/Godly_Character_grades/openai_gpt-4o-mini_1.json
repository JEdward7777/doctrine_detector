From a Christian perspective, the fruits of the Holy Spirit are not merely cultural or individual beliefs but are seen as divine virtues that Christians are called to exhibit as they grow in their relationship with God. The response could have been improved by exploring how individuals, within a Christian framework, strive to embody these qualities through the guidance of the Holy Spirit."
