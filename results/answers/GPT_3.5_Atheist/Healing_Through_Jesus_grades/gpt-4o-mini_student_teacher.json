  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough exploration of the cultural and historical context of demon possession and healing in Jesus' ministry. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing, which was the specified concern. While the student correctly discusses Jesus' compassion and authority in healing demon-possessed individuals, the focus was not explicitly on the role of prayer and faith in the healing process. The reference answer from the teacher highlights the casting out of demons as the primary method of healing, which the student did not specifically address."
