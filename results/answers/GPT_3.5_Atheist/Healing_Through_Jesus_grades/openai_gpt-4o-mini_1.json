The discussion also acknowledges the importance of prayer and faith in healing, which is commendable. However, the response could further emphasize the spiritual significance of these healing miracles in relation to Jesus' divine identity and the fulfillment of messianic prophecies. A deepened exploration of the theological implications of these events would have strengthened the analysis within a Christian worldview."
