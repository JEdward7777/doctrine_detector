The student could improve by emphasizing the role of faith in God's power to heal through anointing, as it is not just a cultural practice but a demonstration of trust in God's ability to bring about physical and spiritual healing. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explicitly mention the role of faith in conjunction with anointing for healing in accordance with Christian beliefs."
