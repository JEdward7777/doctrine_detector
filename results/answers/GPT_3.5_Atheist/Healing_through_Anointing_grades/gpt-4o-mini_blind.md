In the New Testament, the practice of anointing is often associated with healing. Anointing with oil was believed to have medicinal properties and was seen as a way to invoke divine assistance in the healing process. 

In the book of James (5:14-15), it is recommended that those who are sick call for the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. This act of anointing is connected to the prayer for healing, and it is believed that the combination of prayer and anointing can bring about physical and spiritual healing.

The idea of anointing for healing can be seen as a cultural practice of the time, where oil was used for medicinal and ritual purposes. It was a way to demonstrate faith in God's power to heal and was believed to be a channel through which divine healing could flow.

Overall, the practice of anointing for healing in the New Testament is a reflection of the cultural beliefs and practices of the time, where physical healing was often seen as interconnected with spiritual well-being.

Comment: The answer correctly identifies the association between anointing and healing in the New Testament and references James 5:14-15 which supports the connection between anointing with oil and prayer for healing. The student could improve by emphasizing the role of faith in God's power to heal through anointing, as it is not just a cultural practice but a demonstration of trust in God's ability to bring about physical and spiritual healing. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explicitly mention the role of faith in conjunction with anointing for healing in accordance with Christian beliefs.
