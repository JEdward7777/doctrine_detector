  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 75.\n\nThe student accurately mentions the connection between anointing with oil and healing in the New Testament, citing James 5:14-15. They also acknowledge the role of anointing in invoking divine assistance for healing. \n\nHowever, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have delved deeper into the spiritual significance of anointing for healing, emphasizing the role of faith and God's power in the process. They also could have elaborated on the symbolism behind the act of anointing with oil.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could enhance their explanation with more theological insights from a Christian worldview."
