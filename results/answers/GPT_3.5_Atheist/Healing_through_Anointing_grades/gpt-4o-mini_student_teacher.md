In the New Testament, the practice of anointing is often associated with healing. Anointing with oil was believed to have medicinal properties and was seen as a way to invoke divine assistance in the healing process. 

In the book of James (5:14-15), it is recommended that those who are sick call for the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. This act of anointing is connected to the prayer for healing, and it is believed that the combination of prayer and anointing can bring about physical and spiritual healing.

The idea of anointing for healing can be seen as a cultural practice of the time, where oil was used for medicinal and ritual purposes. It was a way to demonstrate faith in God's power to heal and was believed to be a channel through which divine healing could flow.

Overall, the practice of anointing for healing in the New Testament is a reflection of the cultural beliefs and practices of the time, where physical healing was often seen as interconnected with spiritual well-being.

I would grade this student's answer a 75.

The student accurately mentions the connection between anointing with oil and healing in the New Testament, citing James 5:14-15. They also acknowledge the role of anointing in invoking divine assistance for healing. 

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have delved deeper into the spiritual significance of anointing for healing, emphasizing the role of faith and God's power in the process. They also could have elaborated on the symbolism behind the act of anointing with oil.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could enhance their explanation with more theological insights from a Christian worldview.
