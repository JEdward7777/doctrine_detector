However, it could be more thorough in exploring the spiritual dimensions of anointing, such as how it relates to our spiritual well-being and the role of the Holy Spirit in the healing process. Additionally, some supporting biblical references or examples would strengthen the response. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the practice of anointing for healing in the New Testament and its significance in Christian faith.\n\nNote: The concern emphasizes recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice. The response meets this concern by discussing the biblical context and significance of anointing for healing, but could be more explicit about its connection to our spiritual lives."
