It correctly emphasizes the role of the High Priest, the specific instructions for approaching the ark, and the significance of the ark as the earthly dwelling place of God. The explanation of the holiness and reverence required in approaching divine presence is well articulated. Great job in providing doctrinally sound information with appropriate depth and clarity."
