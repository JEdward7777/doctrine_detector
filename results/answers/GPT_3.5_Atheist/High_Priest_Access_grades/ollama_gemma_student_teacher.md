## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the biblical tradition, only the High Priest of Israel was allowed to approach the ark of the covenant, and even then, it was only under specific circumstances and with great caution. According to the Book of Exodus, the High Priest was instructed to enter the Most Holy Place of the Tabernacle once a year on the Day of Atonement, to sprinkle blood on the mercy seat of the ark of the covenant for the forgiveness of the sins of the people.

The ark of the covenant was considered to be the earthly dwelling place of God, and it was believed that touching it or looking at it directly could result in death. This strict protocol surrounding the ark symbolized the holiness and otherness of God, and the need for reverence and respect in approaching divine presence.
