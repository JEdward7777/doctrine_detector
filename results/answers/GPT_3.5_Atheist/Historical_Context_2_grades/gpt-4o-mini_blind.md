The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a way to commemorate their hasty departure and deliverance from slavery. According to the biblical account in the Book of Exodus, they did not have time to let their bread rise before they left Egypt, so they baked unleavened bread instead. This tradition of eating unleavened bread, known as matzah, during the holiday of Passover serves as a reminder of their liberation from bondage and the redemption of the Jewish people.
