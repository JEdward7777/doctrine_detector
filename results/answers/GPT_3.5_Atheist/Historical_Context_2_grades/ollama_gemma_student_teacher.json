  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the historical context and religious significance of the Israelites' consumption of unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt. It accurately references the biblical account and explains the tradition of eating matzah during Passover as a reminder of their liberation. However, the answer could benefit from including a direct citation of the relevant biblical passage or verses to support the claim about God's instruction."
