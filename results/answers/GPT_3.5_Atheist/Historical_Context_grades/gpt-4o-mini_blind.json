  "grade_comment": "Grade: 89\n\nComment: This answer provides a solid explanation of the concept of the remnant as seen in Isaiah and Amos. The student correctly identifies the remnant as a small group of faithful people amidst unfaithfulness and judgment, supported by relevant passages from both books. The answer could be enhanced by delving into the theological significance of the remnant in terms of God's covenant faithfulness and restoration. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
