  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of 'remnant' in both Isaiah and Amos, highlighting the faithfulness of God in preserving a faithful few. The response effectively connects the remnant to God's promises of restoration and mercy. However, there is some room for improvement in directly addressing the historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer; the student's answer expands more on the concept itself rather than emphasizing the historical context."
