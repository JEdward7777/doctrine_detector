  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of the 'remnant' as seen in Isaiah and Amos. They provide clear examples from both books to illustrate the idea of a small surviving group of faithful people amidst judgment. The student also correctly highlights the significance of the remnant as a reminder of God's faithfulness and mercy. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific insights into the historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises."
