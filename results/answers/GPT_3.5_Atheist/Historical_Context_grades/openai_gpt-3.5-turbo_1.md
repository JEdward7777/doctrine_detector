# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In both the Books of Isaiah and Amos in the Bible, the concept of the 'remnant' is highlighted in different ways. The idea of a remnant refers to a small surviving group of people who are faithful to God amidst widespread unfaithfulness and judgment.

In the Book of Isaiah, the prophet speaks about a remnant that will be preserved by God after the nation of Israel faces destruction and exile due to their disobedience. This remnant is seen as a sign of God's continued faithfulness to his people and his promise to ultimately restore them. Isaiah 10:20-23 is one example where the remnant is mentioned: "In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean on him who struck them, but will lean on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God."

Similarly, in the Book of Amos, the prophet also speaks about a remnant that will be spared from God's judgment. In Amos 9:8-15, God promises to restore the fallen booth of David and bring back the remnant of Israel. This remnant is a symbol of hope and renewal amidst the devastation that is foretold for the nation.

Overall, the concept of the remnant in Isaiah and Amos serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness, mercy, and his promise to always preserve a faithful few even in the midst of widespread unfaithfulness and judgment.
