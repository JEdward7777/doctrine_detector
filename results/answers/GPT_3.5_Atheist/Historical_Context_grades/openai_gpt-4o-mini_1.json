It effectively explains how the remnant represents God's preservation of a faithful few amidst judgment and exile, highlighting the persistence in God's covenant with His people. The only improvement could be to further expand on the theological implications of the remnant in these books, connecting it more explicitly to God's overarching plan of redemption and restoration."
