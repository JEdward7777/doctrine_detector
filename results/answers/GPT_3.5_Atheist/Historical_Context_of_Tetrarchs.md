## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies had several impacts on the Jewish people. Firstly, it led to a fracturing of political power among different rulers, which often resulted in internal strife and conflicts within the region. This instability and lack of centralized authority made it challenging for the Jewish people to govern themselves effectively and maintain a sense of unity.

Additionally, the tetrarchies were often ruled by individuals who were not fully accepted by the Jewish population, as they were seen as puppets of the Roman Empire rather than legitimate leaders chosen by the people. This resulted in widespread discontent and resentment among the Jewish population, leading to tensions and resistance against the ruling authorities.

Furthermore, the division of the kingdom into tetrarchies also had religious implications for the Jewish people. The tetrarchs often implemented policies that were not in line with Jewish religious practices and beliefs, which further alienated the Jewish population and contributed to a sense of cultural and religious oppression.

Overall, the division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies had a negative impact on the Jewish people, leading to political instability, social unrest, and religious persecution.
