  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the impacts of the division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies on the Jewish people, touching on political, social, and religious aspects. However, there is a lack of focus on how this historical context specifically relates to Jesus and the early church, as emphasized in the concern. The response could have been strengthened by connecting the tetrarchies' impact to the socio-political dynamics faced by Jesus and the early church."
