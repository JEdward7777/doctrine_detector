  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively explores the concern of how early Christianity transformed a symbol of death into one of life and hope, with Jesus' resurrection at its core. The writer provides a clear and concise overview of the Roman practice of crucifixion and its significance in shaping the perception of the cross in early Christianity. They also accurately highlight the ways in which early Christians transformed the cross from a symbol of shame and suffering to one of hope, victory, and eternal life.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. For example, while the writer mentions Jesus' resurrection, they do not fully develop its significance in transforming the cross into a symbol of life and hope. Additionally, some sentences could be tightened up for clarity and concision. Overall, this is a strong response that effectively explores the concern, but could be even stronger with a bit more development and refinement.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the transformation of the cross from a symbol of death to one of life and hope in early Christianity. To take it to the next level, consider providing more specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate this transformation, as well as further developing the significance of Jesus' resurrection in shaping the Christian message."
