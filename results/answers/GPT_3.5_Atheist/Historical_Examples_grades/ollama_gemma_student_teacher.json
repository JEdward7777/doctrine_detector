  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of altars in the Bible and provides well-articulated examples from the scriptures. The response clearly explains the purpose of altars as physical representations of spiritual encounters, sacrifices, and worship. It also acknowledges the importance of these acts in expressing faith and devotion to God. However, including the additional examples of Noah and Abraham would have strengthened the response and brought it closer to the reference answer."
