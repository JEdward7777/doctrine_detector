It appropriately elaborates on how altars were used for prayer, sacrifice, reflection, and expressing gratitude, aligning well with the concern of inspiring Christians to express their faith and devotion through intentional acts of worship. The integration of additional examples like Jacob's altar at Bethel enriches the explanation and showcases a deeper understanding of the topic. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
