However, it falls short in addressing the concern by not clearly presenting the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity and its role in the believer's life through sound Christian teaching. It is important to ensure that the identity and work of the Holy Spirit are accurately conveyed to prevent misconceptions, especially from a Christian worldview standpoint."
