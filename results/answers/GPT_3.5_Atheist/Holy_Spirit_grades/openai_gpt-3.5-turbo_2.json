While emphasizing universal themes is important for broader understanding, it is essential to ground teachings about the Holy Spirit in Christian doctrine, especially when addressing contexts unfamiliar with the concept of the Trinity. More explicit references to the Holy Spirit's identity as part of the Trinity and His role in the believer's life through sound teaching would enhance the response."
