By presenting the Holy Spirit as a distinct entity separate from the concept of the Trinity, there is a risk of confusion or misinterpretation among individuals unfamiliar with Christian theology. More emphasis on the unique role of the Holy Spirit within the Triune Godhead and how this understanding can enhance one's relationship with God would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
