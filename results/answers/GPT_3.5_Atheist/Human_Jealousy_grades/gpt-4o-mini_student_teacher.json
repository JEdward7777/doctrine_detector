  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and comprehensive response to the question, acknowledging the various factors that contribute to feelings of jealousy in relationships and offering practical strategies for managing it. The emphasis on open communication, self-reflection, and building trust aligns well with a Christian worldview that values honesty, self-awareness, and strong, loving relationships. The only area for improvement is that the student's answer could have more explicitly emphasized the importance of evaluating the health of the relationship and striving for open communication and trust, as highlighted in the reference answer."
