The focus on recognizing jealousy as a warning sign and striving for positive attributes aligns well with a Christian worldview concern about personal relationships and the impact of jealousy on them. The only area for improvement could be to explicitly tie in the importance of seeking God's guidance and peace in addressing jealousy within relationships."
