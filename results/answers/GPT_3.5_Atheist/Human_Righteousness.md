## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Christianity, a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ and his atoning sacrifice on the cross. This belief is central to the concept of justification by grace through faith, as outlined in the New Testament. According to this doctrine, individuals are justified or declared righteous in the eyes of God not by their own works or deeds, but by accepting Jesus Christ as their savior.

It is believed that through Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection, believers are forgiven of their sins and reconciled with God. This act of divine grace is seen as the basis for a person being declared righteous and receiving salvation. Faith in Christ is considered essential for this process of justification, as stated in passages such as Romans 3:22-24: "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."

Overall, in Christian theology, righteousness is not something that can be earned through good works or moral deeds, but is rather a gift from God that comes through faith in Jesus Christ.
