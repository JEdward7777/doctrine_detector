  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that aligns closely with the Christian doctrine of righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. The response effectively highlights the importance of faith in Jesus' atoning sacrifice for the justification and declaration of righteousness before God. The student accurately referenced relevant biblical passages and emphasized the role of God's grace in salvation through faith. The explanation could be further strengthened by explicitly mentioning the imputation of Jesus' righteousness to believers, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a strong and insightful response deserving of a high grade."
