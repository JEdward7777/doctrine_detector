  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively communicates the concept that righteousness comes through faith in Jesus Christ, which aligns with the concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus. The response also accurately reflects Christian theology by emphasizing the idea that God cleanses individuals from their sins and attributes Jesus' righteousness to them when they trust in Him.\n\nThe only areas for improvement would be to provide more scriptural support or examples to further illustrate this concept, and to possibly expand on what this looks like practically in a person's life. Overall, however, the response is clear and concise, and effectively addresses the concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus.\n\nComment: This response provides a solid foundation for understanding salvation and human righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. With some additional detail and support from Scripture, this could be an even stronger response that thoroughly communicates the concept."
