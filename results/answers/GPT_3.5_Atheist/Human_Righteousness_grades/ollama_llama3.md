## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Christianity, a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ and his atoning sacrifice on the cross. This belief is central to the concept of justification by grace through faith, as outlined in the New Testament. According to this doctrine, individuals are justified or declared righteous in the eyes of God not by their own works or deeds, but by accepting Jesus Christ as their savior.

It is believed that through Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection, believers are forgiven of their sins and reconciled with God. This act of divine grace is seen as the basis for a person being declared righteous and receiving salvation. Faith in Christ is considered essential for this process of justification, as stated in passages such as Romans 3:22-24: "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."

Overall, in Christian theology, righteousness is not something that can be earned through good works or moral deeds, but is rather a gift from God that comes through faith in Jesus Christ.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response effectively communicates the concept that righteousness comes through faith in Jesus Christ, which aligns with the concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus. The response also accurately reflects Christian theology by emphasizing the idea that God cleanses individuals from their sins and attributes Jesus' righteousness to them when they trust in Him.

The only areas for improvement would be to provide more scriptural support or examples to further illustrate this concept, and to possibly expand on what this looks like practically in a person's life. Overall, however, the response is clear and concise, and effectively addresses the concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus.

Comment: This response provides a solid foundation for understanding salvation and human righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. With some additional detail and support from Scripture, this could be an even stronger response that thoroughly communicates the concept.
