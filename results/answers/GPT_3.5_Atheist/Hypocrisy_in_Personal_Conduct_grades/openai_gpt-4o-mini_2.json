The incorporation of seeking God's guidance through prayer and living authentically according to His Word is commendable from a Christian worldview. However, the response could have placed a stronger emphasis on the potential consequences of hypocrisy, particularly in relation to the concern raised about losing integrity and causing others to question faith. Reinforcing the dire impact of hypocrisy on one's testimony and witness for Christ would have strengthened the response."
