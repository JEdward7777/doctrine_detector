  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response completely misses the Christian perspective on the phrase \"I have called you by name.\" It fails to acknowledge the biblical significance and spiritual depth of this expression. The analysis is primarily focused on secular and atheistic interpretations, lacking doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. A proper answer should center on the biblical context, emphasizing God's intimate knowledge, love, and personal relationship with His people."
