While they provide some historical and cultural context, they miss the crucial point that being called by name by God signifies a deep personal relationship and divine choosing. The atheistic viewpoint also detracts from the focus on the significance of this phrase in a Christian worldview. Further development of the theological implications and personal significance for believers would enhance the answer."
