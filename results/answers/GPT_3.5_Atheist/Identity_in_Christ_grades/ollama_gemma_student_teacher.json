  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the biblical phrase \"I have called you by name.\" They provide a comprehensive analysis of the historical and cultural context of the phrase, while also acknowledging its potential for personal and symbolic meaning for religious believers. The student's willingness to consider the phrase from an atheistic perspective adds depth to their analysis. Overall, this is an excellent response that effectively addresses the concern about understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ."
