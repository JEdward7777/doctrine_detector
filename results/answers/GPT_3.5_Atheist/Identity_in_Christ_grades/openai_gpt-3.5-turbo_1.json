However, it lacked a Christian-specific worldview in addressing the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. As an atheistic scholar, the response failed to acknowledge the central Christian belief that God's calling reflects a personal relationship and divine purpose for individuals within the framework of Christianity. The focus should have been more on the significance of this phrase within the Christian faith rather than a general view of human longing for connection and recognition."
