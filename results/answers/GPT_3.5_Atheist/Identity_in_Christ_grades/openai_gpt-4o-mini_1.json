However, it falls short of fully embracing the Christian worldview in addressing the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. The atheistic approach presented does not align with a Christian perspective on the significance of being called by name by God. While it appreciates the symbol from a secular standpoint, it misses the depth of meaning in the context of divine purpose and relationship with God through Christ."
