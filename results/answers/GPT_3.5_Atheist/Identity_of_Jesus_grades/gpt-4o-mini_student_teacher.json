  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as a 60. While the student does provide some information on the significance of Jesus's name and his role as Savior from a Christian perspective, they dilute it by introducing a purely scholarly and atheistic standpoint which undermines the importance of Jesus's divinity and purpose as the Savior. The student should focus more on presenting the Christian view of Jesus's name and purpose without diverging into secular interpretations that may conflict with Christian beliefs."
