## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Bible portrays idolatry as a serious offense against God among His people. The consequences of idolatry are often depicted as leading to divine punishment, destruction, and exile. For example, in the Old Testament, the Israelites repeatedly turn to idol worship, which brings about God's wrath. In the Book of Exodus, the Israelites create a golden calf to worship, angering God and causing Him to punish them by withholding His presence and sending plagues.

In the Book of Jeremiah, the consequences of idolatry are vividly described as leading to the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of the Israelites to Babylon. This serves as a powerful warning against straying from worshiping the one true God.

Overall, the Bible illustrates that idolatry not only breaks the first commandment but also has severe consequences for God's people, emphasizing the importance of staying faithful to Him and avoiding the temptation of worshiping false gods or material possessions.
