  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of how the Bible illustrates the consequences of idolatry among God's people, referencing key examples such as the golden calf incident in Exodus and the exile to Babylon in Jeremiah. The explanation of idolatry breaking the first commandment and the emphasis on staying faithful to the one true God are appropriate. To enhance the answer, more specific scriptural references could be included to support the points made. Additionally, connecting the consequences of idolatry to the broader theological implications, such as the impact on the relationship between God and His people, would further strengthen the answer."
