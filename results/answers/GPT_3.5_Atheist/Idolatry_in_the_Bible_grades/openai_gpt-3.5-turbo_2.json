  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a well-supported explanation of the consequences of idolatry in the Bible, highlighting the serious nature of straying from God's commandments. The student effectively connects the consequences of idolatry to the importance of faithfulness to God, emphasizing the Christian worldview of worshiping the one true God. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific scriptural references for further depth in support of the argument. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
