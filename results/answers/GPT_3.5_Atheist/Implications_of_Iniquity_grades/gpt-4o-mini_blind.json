It approaches the topic from an atheistic standpoint, which does not align with the framework of Christian beliefs. While the explanation on how understanding iniquity as 'harmful acts' can influence behavior is somewhat accurate, it fails to incorporate Christian doctrine, teachings, or Scriptures to support the argument. The focus should be on how Christians, guided by the Bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ, should respond to iniquity as harmful acts in their interactions with others. Encouraging the integration of Christian principles and theology would significantly strengthen the response."
