The explanation regarding their desire to maintain power and authority is relevant and aligns with historical accounts. However, the response could be improved by including more specific biblical references to support the claims made about the actions and intentions of the Sadducees and Pharisees. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, it would be important to highlight the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart that played a significant role in their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah."
