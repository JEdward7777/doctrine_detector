  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85. The student provided a solid understanding of how the Sadducees and Pharisees were driven by a desire to maintain power and authority in the crucifixion of Jesus, touching on their motivations and actions accurately. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly linking their behavior to the concepts of selfishness and hypocrisy, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, the student effectively connected the historical account to a broader lesson about the dangers of institutional corruption, which demonstrates a good application of the context to contemporary faith."
