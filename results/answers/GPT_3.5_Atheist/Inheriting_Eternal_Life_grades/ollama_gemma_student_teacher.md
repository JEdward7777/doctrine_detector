In the Christian belief system, the Bible states in various verses that in order to inherit eternal life, one must believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior, repent of their sins, and follow his teachings. For example, in John 3:16 it is written, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
