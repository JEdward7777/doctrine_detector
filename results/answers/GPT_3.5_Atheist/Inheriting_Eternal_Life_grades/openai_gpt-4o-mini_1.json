  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively references specific verses from the Bible to support the statement about inheriting eternal life through belief in Jesus Christ and following his teachings. It aligns well with the concern provided, clarifying the path to salvation as taught by Jesus in the context of Christian beliefs. Additionally, the acknowledgment of differing interpretations among Christian denominations adds a layer of complexity and awareness to the discussion."
