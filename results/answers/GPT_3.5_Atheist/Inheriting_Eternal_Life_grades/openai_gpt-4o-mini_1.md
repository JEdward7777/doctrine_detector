## [Answer](../Inheriting_Eternal_Life.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Christian belief system, the Bible states in various verses that in order to inherit eternal life, one must believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior, repent of their sins, and follow his teachings. For example, in John 3:16 it is written, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Additionally, in Mark 16:16 it says, "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."

It is important to note that beliefs about eternal life and salvation vary among different Christian denominations, and interpretations of the Bible can differ.
