From a Christian standpoint, the answer could have included references to biblical principles such as seeking justice (Micah 6:8), loving one's neighbor (Matthew 22:39), and caring for the oppressed (Isaiah 1:17). A stronger integration of Christian teachings and values would have enhanced the response."
