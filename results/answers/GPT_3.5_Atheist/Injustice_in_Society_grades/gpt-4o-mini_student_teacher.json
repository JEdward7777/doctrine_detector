  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provides a comprehensive overview of different forms of injustice in the world today and suggests general strategies for addressing these issues, their answer lacks specific guidance on how Christians should respond to injustice based on biblical principles. The answer also does not fully consider the need for Christian activism against injustice or emphasize the importance of promoting fairness in alignment with biblical teachings. The student should have integrated more explicitly Christian perspectives and actions in their response to better address the concern provided."
