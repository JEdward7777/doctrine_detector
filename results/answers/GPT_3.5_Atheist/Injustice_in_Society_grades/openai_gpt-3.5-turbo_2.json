However, it also includes perspectives from atheistic and secular ethical standpoints without emphasizing the unique calling for Christians to engage in activism based on their faith. A stronger emphasis on the biblical mandate for Christians to actively address injustice would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
