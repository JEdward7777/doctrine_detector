It is commendable that the response mentions demonstrating mercy and acting righteously, but it could have delved deeper into how Christians can actively engage in addressing systemic injustices such as racism, economic inequality, and discrimination. More explicit references to biblical teachings on social justice and the responsibility of Christians to actively work towards a more just society would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
