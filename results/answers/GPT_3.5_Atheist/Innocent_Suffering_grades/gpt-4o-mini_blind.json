However, the answer becomes problematic when it shifts to discussing the perspectives of atheism and secular ethics. From a Christian worldview, the value of life is rooted in the belief that human beings are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27) and therefore have inherent worth and dignity. Bringing in atheistic perspectives blurs the doctrinal correctness that should have been the focus of the response. Additionally, more specific Bible verses could have been cited to strengthen the argument."
