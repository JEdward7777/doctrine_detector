  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student accurately explains the concept of \"innocent blood\" in the Bible and its implications on the value of life. They effectively connect it to issues of justice and morality. However, the student detracts from a Christian worldview with the inclusion of an atheistic perspective towards the end of the answer. It would have been stronger if they had focused solely on a Christian perspective throughout the response."
