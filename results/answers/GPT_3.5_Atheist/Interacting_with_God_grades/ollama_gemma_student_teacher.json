  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the relationship between responses to God and their influence on personal beliefs and actions. However, it does not address the Christian-specific worldview or the specific concern related to God's will for the student's life. The response lacks a clear articulation of how responses to God align with God's will as understood from a Christian perspective."
