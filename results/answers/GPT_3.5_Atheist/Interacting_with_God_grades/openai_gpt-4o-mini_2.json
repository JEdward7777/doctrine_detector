It does not engage with the idea of the impact of one's choices on their relationship with God and the unfolding of His plans, which is crucial in understanding the Christian perspective on obedience and faith. Additionally, as an atheist perspective was provided, it could have been more charitable towards Christian beliefs and their implications on one's life."
