  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of \"the last day\" in Christian teaching, highlighting the final judgment and the ultimate separation of the righteous and unrighteous. The answer also emphasizes the importance of living a righteous life in alignment with Christian principles. It would have been strengthened further by referencing the authority of Jesus Christ in executing this judgment as taught in Christian doctrine. Overall, a well-structured and doctrinally sound response."
