It accurately explains that the event involves a final judgment and reckoning, during which all people will be held accountable for their actions and beliefs. Additionally, the response correctly highlights the belief that God will separate the righteous from the unrighteous, with the former receiving eternal life and the latter facing punishment or condemnation. The student's use of Christian principles to contextualize the concept is also commendable."
