In Christian teaching, "the last day" typically refers to the final day of judgment and reckoning, when all people will be held accountable for their actions and beliefs. It is believed that on this day, God will separate the righteous from the unrighteous, with the righteous being rewarded with eternal life and the unrighteous facing punishment or condemnation.
