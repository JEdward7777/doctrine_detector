In an atheistic perspective, the concept of 'divine glory' can be understood as a culturally retributed idea that reflects the beliefs and values of a particular religious tradition. In the context of worship, 'divine glory' may refer to the reverence, honor, and adoration shown to a deity or deities by their followers.

Worship practices often involve rituals, prayers, and offerings that are intended to demonstrate devotion and respect towards the divine. The concept of 'divine glory' may also encompass the idea of the divine being worthy of praise and admiration for their perceived attributes, such as power, wisdom, or benevolence. 

From an atheistic perspective, the notion of 'divine glory' can be seen as a product of human imagination and cultural conditioning, reflecting the way in which societies have constructed and projected their beliefs about the supernatural onto the world around them.
