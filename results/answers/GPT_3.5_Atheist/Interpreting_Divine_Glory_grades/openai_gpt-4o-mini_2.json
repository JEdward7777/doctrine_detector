  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation from an atheistic perspective regarding the concept of 'divine glory' in worship practices. While it accurately describes the cultural and subjective aspects of this concept, it fails to acknowledge the Christian worldview presented in the given answer. From a Christian perspective, 'divine glory' is not merely a product of human imagination but a fundamental aspect of God's nature that demands reverence and worship. The response missed the opportunity to contrast the atheistic view with the Christian view, resulting in a low grade."
