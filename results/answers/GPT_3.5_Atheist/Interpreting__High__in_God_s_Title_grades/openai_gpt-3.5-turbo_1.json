The concern about understanding the metaphorical use of descriptive titles is addressed well. However, the response could have delved deeper into how the term reflects the attributes of God such as His transcendence and sovereignty, which are essential aspects of His nature according to Christian beliefs. Overall, a strong understanding is demonstrated, but a more explicit connection to Christian theology could further enhance the response."
