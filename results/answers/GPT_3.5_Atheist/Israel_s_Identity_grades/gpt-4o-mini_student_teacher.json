  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 90.\n\nThe student accurately explains the biblical origin of the name 'Israel,' mentioning its Hebrew meaning and the story from the Book of Genesis where Jacob wrestles with an angel and receives the name. They also correctly highlight the significance of the name in representing the Israelite people's relationship with God and the establishment of the nation of Israel. However, the student's explanation is slightly elaborate and adds interpretations beyond what is explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Consequently, the grade is slightly reduced to account for the additional interpretations not explicitly stated in the biblical text."
