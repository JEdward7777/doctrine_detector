However, it falls short of adequately reflecting on God's guidance and provision in the journey of His people, which is a key aspect when viewing this event through a Christian specific worldview. It is important to recognize and incorporate the role of divine intervention and faith in interpreting the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land."
