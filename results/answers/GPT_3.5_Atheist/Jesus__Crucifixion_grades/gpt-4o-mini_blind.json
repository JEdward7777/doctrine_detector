However, it fails to address the deeper theological implications of this act within a Christian worldview. The perspective provided is solely focused on historical and cultural aspects without delving into the spiritual meaning. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, it is essential to recognize the symbolic and prophetic significance of myrrh in relation to Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. The answer is lacking in theological depth and fails to connect the act to Jesus' experience on the cross in a meaningful way."
