However, as an atheistic scholar, the perspective lacks an understanding and acknowledgment of the theological and doctrinal depth behind Jesus' declaration. The student correctly discusses the belief in Jesus as the source of spiritual renewal and eternal life, but they miss the key point that Jesus' statement in John 11:25 goes beyond a mere reflection of early Christian community understanding; it represents Jesus' claim to be the very source and giver of life, both spiritually and physically, as the divine Son of God. The crucial theological implications of Jesus being the Resurrection and the Life in Christian doctrine should have been highlighted more explicitly for a higher grade."
