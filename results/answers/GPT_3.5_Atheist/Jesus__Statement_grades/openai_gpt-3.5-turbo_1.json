  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned perspective on the statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" from a historical and cultural standpoint. It acknowledges the Christian belief in Jesus' divinity and salvific role, aligning with the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly stating the significance of Jesus' role in light of Christian theology and faith in connection to the concern provided."
