  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid analysis from an atheistic perspective, focusing on the historical and cultural context of Jesus' statement. The scholar acknowledges the significance of Jesus as the source of spiritual renewal and eternal life for believers. However, the response falls short in explicitly addressing the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection from a Christian worldview. It could have provided more depth in explaining the theological implications of Jesus' statement for faith and understanding within a Christian context."
