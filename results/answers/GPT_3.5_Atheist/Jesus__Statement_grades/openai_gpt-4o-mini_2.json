It effectively explains the significance of this statement within early Christian beliefs and theology. However, the response falls short in addressing the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection from a Christian worldview. While it touches on the divinity and salvific role of Jesus, it could have delved deeper into explicating how Jesus being the source of resurrection ties into Christian faith and theological understanding."
