While the student does not subscribe to the belief in Jesus as a divine figure, they acknowledge the historical and cultural significance of the term \"amen\" in religious contexts. However, the answer lacks specific examples or textual evidence from Scripture to support the claim that Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize his teachings. Including such evidence would have strengthened the response."
