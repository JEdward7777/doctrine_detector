  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response acknowledges that Jesus used the term \"amen\" in his teachings, which is accurate according to the given answer. It also attempts to explain why Jesus might have used \"amen\" by emphasizing the importance and validity of his message, which shows some understanding of Jesus' authority as taught in Scripture.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly recognize the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, which was the concern specified. While it mentions that Jesus was encouraging his audience to believe in what he was saying, it does not specifically highlight the divine authority behind those words.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to explicitly acknowledge Jesus' divine authority as the source of his teachings and to emphasize how that authority is reflected in his use of \"amen\"."
