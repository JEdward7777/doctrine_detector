  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful analysis from an atheistic perspective addressing the historical and cultural significance of the term \"amen\" in relation to Jesus. While the student did not recognize Jesus as a divine figure, they acknowledged the role of \"amen\" in emphasizing the validity of Jesus' teachings. However, the response fell short in fully acknowledging the ultimate authority of Jesus' words and teachings as presented in Scripture, which is a key aspect of understanding Jesus from a Christian worldview."
