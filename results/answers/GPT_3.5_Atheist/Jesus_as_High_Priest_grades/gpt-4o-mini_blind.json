  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid explanation of the concept of Jesus as the High Priest and the implications of his sacrifice for human priests and sacrifices. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of Christian theology and effectively conveys the significance of Jesus' role in relation to the priesthood. However, to improve, the student could include more specific references to Scripture to strengthen their explanation and support their points."
