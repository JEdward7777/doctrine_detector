  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of Jesus as the High Priest and the implications for the sacrifices made by human priests. They correctly highlight the significance of Jesus' role as the ultimate mediator and the final sacrifice. The student effectively connects these concepts to the fulfillment and surpassing of the sacrificial system by Jesus. However, the answer could have been improved by directly quoting relevant biblical passages or theological teachings to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
