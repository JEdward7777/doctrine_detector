How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Christianity, Jesus is often referred to as the "High Priest" or the "eternal High Priest." This title signifies his role as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, surpassing the traditional priesthood established in the Old Testament. According to Christian theology, Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is seen as the final and perfect sacrifice that atones for the sins of humanity once and for all.

The concept of Jesus as the High Priest has significant implications for the sacrifices made by human priests. In traditional religious practices, priests served as intermediaries between the people and God, offering sacrifices to atone for sins and seek divine favor. However, with the belief in Jesus as the ultimate High Priest who offered himself as a sacrifice, the need for animal sacrifices and human priests to intercede on behalf of the people is considered obsolete.

Therefore, in Christianity, the sacrificial system of the priesthood is seen as fulfilled and surpassed by Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. This understanding emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus as the ultimate High Priest who offers salvation and reconciliation with God, rather than relying on human priests and sacrificial rituals.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' role as our High Priest, correctly emphasizing his intercession in God's presence and sacrifice for sin. It also accurately conveys the implication that human priests' sacrifices are no longer necessary due to Jesus' fulfillment of this role.

The response is clear and concise, making it easy to follow and understand. However, there is room for improvement in terms of depth and elaboration on the significance of Jesus' role as our High Priest. The original text provided more details on how Jesus' sacrifice surpassed traditional priesthood and offered salvation through faith, which could have been incorporated into this response.

Overall, while this response hits the main points, it could benefit from a bit more development to truly demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of Jesus' role in the priesthood.
