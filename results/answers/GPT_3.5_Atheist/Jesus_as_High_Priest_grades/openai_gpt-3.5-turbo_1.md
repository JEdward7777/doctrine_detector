How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

# Correct Answer

# Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Christianity, Jesus is often referred to as the "High Priest" or the "eternal High Priest." This title signifies his role as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, surpassing the traditional priesthood established in the Old Testament. According to Christian theology, Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is seen as the final and perfect sacrifice that atones for the sins of humanity once and for all.

The concept of Jesus as the High Priest has significant implications for the sacrifices made by human priests. In traditional religious practices, priests served as intermediaries between the people and God, offering sacrifices to atone for sins and seek divine favor. However, with the belief in Jesus as the ultimate High Priest who offered himself as a sacrifice, the need for animal sacrifices and human priests to intercede on behalf of the people is considered obsolete.

Therefore, in Christianity, the sacrificial system of the priesthood is seen as fulfilled and surpassed by Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. This understanding emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus as the ultimate High Priest who offers salvation and reconciliation with God, rather than relying on human priests and sacrificial rituals.
