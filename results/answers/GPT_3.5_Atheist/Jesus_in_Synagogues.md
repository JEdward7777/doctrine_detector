## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a scholarly perspective, it is important to note that the historical accounts of Jesus' interactions with synagogues during his ministry are primarily found in the Christian New Testament. These accounts were written by early followers of Jesus and are considered sacred texts by Christians.

According to the New Testament, Jesus regularly visited synagogues to teach and engage in dialogue with the religious leaders of his time. He used these opportunities to challenge prevailing interpretations of Jewish religious law and to proclaim his own teachings. Some accounts depict Jesus performing miracles and healing the sick in synagogues, which often led to praise and controversy among the crowds.

It is important to approach these accounts with a critical eye, considering the theological motivations of the authors and the historical context in which these texts were written. While they offer valuable insights into Jesus' teachings and interactions with religious institutions, they must be examined alongside other historical sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of the historical Jesus and his relationship with synagogues.
