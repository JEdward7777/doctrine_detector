  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the theological significance of \"Jesus is Lord\" by emphasizing His divine authority and supremacy over all creation, distinct from human rulers, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. The clarification on the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles is effectively addressed, although a bit more emphasis could have been placed on the absolute authority of Jesus in contrast to the temporary and limited authority of political leaders. Overall, this response effectively communicates the Christian perspective on the phrase in the given context."
