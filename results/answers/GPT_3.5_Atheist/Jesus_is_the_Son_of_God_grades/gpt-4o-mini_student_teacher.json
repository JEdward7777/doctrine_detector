  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response attempts to minimize offense by altering the translation to fit a Muslim context, which is commendable. However, the concern specified the importance of maintaining Biblical accuracy and providing clear teaching and context. The student's answer significantly deviates from the reference answer by not maintaining the original terminology and failing to explain the meaning with appropriate Biblical context. The student's answer does not accurately convey the full significance of Jesus being the Son of God in a Muslim context, therefore leading to a lower grade."
