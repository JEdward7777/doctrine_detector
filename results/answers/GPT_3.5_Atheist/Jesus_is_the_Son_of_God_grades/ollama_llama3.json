  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of acknowledging the need to maintain the original terminology while providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning, which aligns with the concern about minimizing offense while ensuring Biblically accuracy. However, I deduct points because the response does not explicitly address the biblical accuracy of translating \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context. While it's understandable that Muslims may not consider Jesus as the literal son of God, the response could have also emphasized the importance of maintaining the original meaning and context of the phrase.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the need to balance cultural sensitivity with biblical accuracy, but could be improved by more explicitly addressing the issue of translating \"Jesus is the Son of God\" in a Muslim context."
