# Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

# Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

# Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In a Muslim context, the phrase "Jesus is the Son of God" would not be translated directly as such, as this concept goes against the core beliefs of Islam. Instead, you could phrase it as "Jesus is a revered prophet in Islam and holds a special place in the eyes of God." Muslims believe that Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is a significant prophet, but they do not consider him to be the literal son of God as Christians do.
