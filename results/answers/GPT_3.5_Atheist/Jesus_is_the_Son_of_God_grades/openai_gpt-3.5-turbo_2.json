  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain the meaning, which aligns with the concern of ensuring Biblical accuracy. However, it diverges from the specific instruction to translate \"Jesus is the Son of God\" directly and provide the appropriate explanation. Therefore, while the response provides valuable insight, it falls short of fully addressing the specified concern."
