However, by suggesting a translation that deviates from the original terminology and meaning of the phrase in a Christian context, it fails to adhere to the concern of maintaining Biblical accuracy in the translation. It is important to respect religious differences, but accuracy in conveying the intended meaning of the original text should also be prioritized."
