The connection to Old Testament prophecies and the lineage of Abraham and David is also emphasized, aligning well with the concern regarding the Jewish roots of Christianity. The only area for improvement could be the inclusion of a direct reference to Jesus' fulfillment of specific prophecies or his role as the Messiah, to further deepen the theological reflection."
