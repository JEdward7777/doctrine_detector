While it does not directly address the concern about the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and Jesus as the Messiah in the lineage of Abraham and David, it effectively elaborates on the broader implications of understanding the Jewish roots of Christianity. Overall, a well-thought-out and insightful response."
