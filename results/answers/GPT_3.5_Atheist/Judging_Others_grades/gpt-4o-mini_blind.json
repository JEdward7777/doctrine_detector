  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student shows a basic understanding of the biblical instruction against Christians judging one another, primarily referencing Matthew 7:1-5. However, they could have elaborated further on the interpretation and context of this passage within the broader teachings of the Bible. Additionally, the belief that only God has ultimate authority to judge is accurate, but there could have been more emphasis on the importance of correcting and guiding fellow believers in a spirit of love and humility rather than simply avoiding judgment. More depth and scriptural support could have improved this response."
