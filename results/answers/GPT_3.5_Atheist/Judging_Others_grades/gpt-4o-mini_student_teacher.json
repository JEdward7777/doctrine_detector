  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a strong understanding of the prohibition against judgment in the Bible, particularly citing Matthew 7:1-5 accurately. However, the student could enhance their answer by including additional verses, such as Luke 6:37, which specifically address how Christians should approach judgment within the community. It is important for Christians to not only refrain from judgment but also to actively support and encourage each other in their faith journey."
