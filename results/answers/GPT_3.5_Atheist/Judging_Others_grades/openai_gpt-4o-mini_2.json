  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the biblical teaching on not judging others, and supports it with a relevant passage from Luke. It also emphasizes the importance of encouraging and supporting fellow believers in their faith journey, aligning with the concern of approaching relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner. The only minor critique is that it could have included more specific examples or practical applications of how to implement these principles in relationships within the Christian community."
