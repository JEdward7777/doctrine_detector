  "grade": 10.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 10/100.\n\nComment: The student completely missed the Christian perspective in their response and opted for an atheistic viewpoint, which goes against the specified concern of considering biblical principles. The answer did not address how individuals will be judged according to the biblical perspective. It lacked the essential element of aligning with Christian beliefs and principles, receiving a low grade as a result."
