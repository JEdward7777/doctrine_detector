The response dismisses the concept of judgment as a cultural belief, which does not engage with the Christian concern of aligning actions with biblical principles. From a Christian perspective, judgment is a divine truth based on alignment with Christ's righteous character, and this response fails to address the Christian-specific concern presented."
