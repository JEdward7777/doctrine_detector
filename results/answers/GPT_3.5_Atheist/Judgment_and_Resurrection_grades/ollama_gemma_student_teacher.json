  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that clearly identifies and explains the events associated with the \"day of Yahweh.\" It accurately summarizes the recurring theme in the Hebrew Bible and provides relevant examples from the prophets. However, it would benefit from further elaboration on the concepts of judgment and resurrection, as per the teacher's reference answer."
