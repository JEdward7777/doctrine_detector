## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I approach this question from a cultural and linguistic perspective rather than a religious one. When translating religious concepts like the 'Kingdom of God' for cultures without a concept of kingdoms, it may be advisable to rephrase it in a way that is more easily understood and relatable to the target audience.

In this case, one could consider using a term that conveys the idea of a divine realm or domain of ultimate truth and righteousness, rather than a literal kingdom ruled by a monarch. This adaptation would help ensure that the essence of the original concept is preserved while making it more accessible and meaningful to those with different cultural backgrounds.

Ultimately, the goal of translation is to facilitate understanding and communication, so it is important to consider the cultural context and sensitivity of the audience when rephrasing religious concepts in different languages.
