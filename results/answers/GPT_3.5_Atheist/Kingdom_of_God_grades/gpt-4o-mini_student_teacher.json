  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-reasoned from a cultural and linguistic perspective, overlooks the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God'. As a Christian, it is essential to prioritize preserving the original spiritual and eschatological significance of this term in translations, rather than solely focusing on making it more easily understood for different cultures. Further explanation on the importance of maintaining the original term's integrity within its religious context would strengthen the answer."
