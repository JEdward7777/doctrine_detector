  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 40.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges the importance of cultural sensitivity in translation, it does not fully address the concern about losing depth and biblical context by rephrasing \"Kingdom of God\". The response suggests that rephrasing could be a way to make the concept more accessible, but it does not provide sufficient justification for why retaining the original term is necessary. Additionally, the response does not engage with the biblical significance of the term \"Kingdom of God\" in any meaningful way.\n\nThe concern was specifically that rephrasing could lose the depth and biblical context of the term \"Kingdom of God\", but this response does not adequately address or acknowledge this concern. Therefore, I would give it a relatively low grade."
