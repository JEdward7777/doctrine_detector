As a Christian, it is crucial to preserve the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' rather than dilute it for the sake of cultural adaptability. The suggested approach of retaining the original term and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance aligns more closely with a Christian worldview."
