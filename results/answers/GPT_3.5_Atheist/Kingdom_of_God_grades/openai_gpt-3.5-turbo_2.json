  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided fails to address the concern raised about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' by rephrasing it. As an atheistic scholar, the respondent's approach does not take into account the Christian-specific worldview that values the preservation of the original biblical concepts. Additionally, the suggestion to rephrase the term without emphasizing the spiritual and eschatological significance contradicts the concern provided. A more appropriate response would have been to acknowledge the importance of retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' while still making efforts to explain its significance for better understanding."
