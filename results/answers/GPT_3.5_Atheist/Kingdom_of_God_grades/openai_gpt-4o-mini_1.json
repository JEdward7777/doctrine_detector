As a Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of preserving the original biblical teachings and concepts, this response falls short in providing an adequate solution. It is crucial to prioritize accurately conveying the spiritual and eschatological significance of 'Kingdom of God' rather than diluting it for cultural or linguistic ease."
