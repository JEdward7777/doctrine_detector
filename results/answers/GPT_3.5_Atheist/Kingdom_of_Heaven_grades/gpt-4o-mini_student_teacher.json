However, the student's atheistic viewpoint could potentially color their interpretation of the term, leading to a lack of depth in addressing the theological implications specific to Matthew's gospel. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more focused exploration of how the term \"heaven\" in this context relates to God's reign, as highlighted in the reference answer."
