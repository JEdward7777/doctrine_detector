  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thoughtful response that effectively addresses the concern about retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven.\" The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the cultural and religious significance of the term within the context of Matthew's gospel and the Christian tradition. The response also acknowledges the limitations of their own beliefs as an atheist scholar while respecting the importance of retaining the original terminology for cultural and religious authenticity."
