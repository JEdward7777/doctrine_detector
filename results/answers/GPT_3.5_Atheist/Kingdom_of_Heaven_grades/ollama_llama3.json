  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does address the concern of understanding unique terminology used in the gospels, specifically the term \"kingdom of heaven\" in Matthew's gospel. It also provides some cultural and historical context for the phrase, which is relevant to the concern.\n\nHowever, while the response mentions theological implications regarding God's reign, it could be more explicitly biblical and Christ-centered in its understanding. The answer provided as a comparison point does not seem to have been directly addressed or engaged with in this response. For example, the answer mentions specific theological implications regarding God's reign, but these are not explored further in the response.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest incorporating more direct engagement with the biblical text and exploring the theological implications of the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in greater depth."
