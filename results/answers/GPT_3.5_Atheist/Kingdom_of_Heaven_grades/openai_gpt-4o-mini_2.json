It acknowledges the importance of understanding the unique terminology used in the gospels to grasp the intended messages of the biblical authors, aligning well with the provided concern. The reflection on cultural and religious value, while approaching from an atheistic perspective, still respects the significance of the term within the Christian tradition."
