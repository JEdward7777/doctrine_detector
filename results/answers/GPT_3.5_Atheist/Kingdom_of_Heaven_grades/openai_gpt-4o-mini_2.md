In the context of the book of Matthew and the Christian tradition, the term "kingdom of heaven" holds significant cultural and historical value. It is a reflection of the beliefs and teachings prevalent in that context, particularly in relation to the afterlife and spiritual realms.

While as an atheistic scholar I do not ascribe to the literal existence of heaven as a place or concept, I can understand the importance of retaining the term in its original context for cultural and religious purposes. The concept of heaven plays a crucial role in shaping beliefs, morals, and values for many individuals and communities, and it is a foundational aspect of numerous belief systems.

Therefore, retaining the term "heaven" in the phrase "kingdom of heaven" in the book of Matthew maintains the authenticity and integrity of the text within its cultural and religious framework. It also helps to preserve the nuances and symbolism inherent in the original language and context in which the text was written, allowing for a more accurate understanding and interpretation of the message being conveyed.
