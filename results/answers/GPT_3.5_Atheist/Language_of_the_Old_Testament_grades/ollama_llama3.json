  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response accurately answers the given question, stating that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is correct. Additionally, it provides some extra information about Aramaic being used for specific books, which is also accurate. However, the response could be improved by providing more context and explanation about why this knowledge is essential for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context.\n\nThe concern that \"This knowledge is essential for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context\" is not fully addressed in this response. While it mentions that the languages were used to record religious texts and traditions, it does not explicitly state how understanding the original language impacts our interpretation of Scripture or its historical context.\n\nOverall, the response provides some good information, but could be strengthened by providing more depth and analysis on why this knowledge is important for biblical study."
