  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed and well-rounded description of believers in ancient cities meeting in various settings for gatherings, worship, and communal activities, they did not directly address the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers as the reference answer did. The student's response focused more on the logistics and practices of early Christian gatherings rather than emphasizing the importance of local fellowship and encouragement among believers. \n\nTo improve their answer, the student should have specifically highlighted the significance of believers meeting in homes to foster intimate fellowship, mutual support, and community building among the early Christians. By aligning their response more closely with the concern of fostering local fellowship, the student could have earned a higher grade."
