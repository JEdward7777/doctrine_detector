# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Romans 8:23 speaks about believers eagerly waiting for the adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. This passage implies that believers are anticipating a future state where they will be fully recognized as God's children and will experience complete redemption of their physical bodies.

For believers, this waiting for adoption as sons signifies their hope and faith in the promise of a future glorious transformation and eternal life. It serves as a reminder to remain steadfast in their belief, trusting in God's plan for their ultimate salvation and restoration.

In a culturally retributed perspective, this waiting can be seen as a form of accountability and justice, where believers are rewarded for their faith and righteousness by being granted the status of God's adopted children. It underscores the inherent worth and dignity of each individual believer in the eyes of God, ultimately leading to a just and equitable outcome for those who have put their trust in Him.
