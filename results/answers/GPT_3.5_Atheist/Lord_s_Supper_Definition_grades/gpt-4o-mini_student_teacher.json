  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid understanding of the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith by highlighting its connection to the Last Supper and Jesus' sacrifice for humanity. The student appropriately discusses the symbolic nature of the ritual and its representation of the new covenant. While the student's answer aligns well with the core Christian beliefs regarding the Lord's Supper, there is a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer in terms of specifically noting the Passover meal. This deviation warrants a minor deduction in the grade."
