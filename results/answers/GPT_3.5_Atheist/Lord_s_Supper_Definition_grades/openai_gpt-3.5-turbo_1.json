It appropriately highlights the symbolism of Jesus' body and blood as a sacrifice for sin. However, the response could have delved deeper into the connection between the Lord's Supper and the new covenant that Jesus established, as well as the ongoing spiritual nourishment and unity it signifies for believers."
