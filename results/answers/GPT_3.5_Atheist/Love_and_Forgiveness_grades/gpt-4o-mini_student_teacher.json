  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated explanation on the importance of forgiveness in the biblical context, highlighting aspects of divine justice, mercy, and compassion. However, the answer lacked a direct connection to the core Christian principle of forgiveness reflecting God's unconditional love and being essential for maintaining healthy relationships, as emphasized in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to further deepen their understanding of forgiveness within the context of God's love would enhance the response."
