The student also rightly highlights the moral and spiritual aspect of marriage as a sacred institution. However, there is room for improvement in incorporating more specific biblical references or theological teachings to strengthen the Christian perspective. Additionally, the response could delve deeper into the biblical roles of husbands and wives in marriage, as well as the sacrificial love modeled after Christ's love for the Church. Overall, a good foundation is present, but more theological depth and scriptural support would enhance the answer."
