  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a good overview of the significance of the 'bond of marriage' from a Christian perspective and emphasizes the importance of commitment, love, and mutual support in marriage. However, the answer could more explicitly tie these points back to God's design for marriage and the emphasis on honoring the commitment established by Him. Additionally, while the response covers key aspects, it could delve deeper into the spiritual aspects of marriage and the biblical foundation for the concept of marriage as a sacred institution."
