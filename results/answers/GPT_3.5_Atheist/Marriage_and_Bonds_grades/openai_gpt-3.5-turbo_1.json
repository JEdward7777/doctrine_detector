The emphasis on upholding the commitment out of respect for the relationship and honoring trust and love aligns well with promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages. However, the response could have further strengthened the Christian perspective by explicitly referencing biblical teachings on marriage and the roles of husbands and wives in a marriage relationship."
