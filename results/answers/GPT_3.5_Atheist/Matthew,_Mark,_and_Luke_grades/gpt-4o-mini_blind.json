  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer correctly identifies that the names of the twelve disciples can be found in the New Testament, specifically in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Acts. The student accurately lists the names of the disciples and acknowledges that the lists may vary slightly across the different books. Good job overall, with a strong emphasis on doctrinal correctness."
