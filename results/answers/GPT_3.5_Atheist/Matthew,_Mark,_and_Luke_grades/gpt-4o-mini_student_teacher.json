  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate response in identifying the books where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. However, they included Acts which does not specifically list the twelve disciples. Additionally, the concern was to be familiar with the Gospel accounts, and the reference answer specifically identified Matthew, Mark, and Luke as the books where the disciples are listed, so points are deducted for not entirely aligning with the specific concern provided."
