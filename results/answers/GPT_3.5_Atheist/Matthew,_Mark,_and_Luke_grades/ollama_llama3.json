  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates good knowledge of the biblical accounts, accurately identifying the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Acts) as the sources for the names of the twelve disciples. However, it could be improved by providing more specific information about the slight variations in the lists across these books, as mentioned in the original response. Additionally, the concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings is partially addressed, but not fully demonstrated through a deeper exploration of the teachings and significance of the twelve disciples."
