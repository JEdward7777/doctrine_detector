  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies that the names of the twelve disciples can be found in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. However, the mention of Acts in the initial response should have been acknowledged as well. The concern regarding being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings is addressed satisfactorily."
