Grade: 70

Comment: The response correctly identifies where the names of the twelve disciples can be found but fails to mention the book of Acts, which also lists the disciples. The concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings is partially addressed by referencing the correct books, but could be improved by acknowledging the importance of understanding the significance of the twelve disciples in the context of Jesus' ministry and teachings.
