The mention of the prophecies from Isaiah 7:14 and 2 Samuel 7:12-13, along with the fulfillment by Jesus, demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of these prophecies in affirming Jesus as the Messiah. The response could have been further strengthened by incorporating additional examples and elaborating on how these prophecies strengthen faith in Jesus as the Messiah, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
