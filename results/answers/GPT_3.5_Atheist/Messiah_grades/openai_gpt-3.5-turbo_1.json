It also acknowledges the differences in the interpretations of the Messiah in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The explanation is clear and aligns with the concern to differentiate Jesus' role from other religious savior figures while staying true to scripture. A slight improvement could be made by including more specific scriptural references to further support the points made."
