  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: \nThe answer provides a decent explanation of what it means to \"minister\" to others in both secular and religious contexts. However, it lacks depth in discussing the specifically Christian understanding of ministering. The student missed the opportunity to emphasize the importance of ministering in light of the gospel, the example set by Jesus Christ, and the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers to minister effectively. Additionally, the answer spends more time on the atheistic perspective than necessary for the question at hand. More focus on the biblical principles and teachings regarding ministering would have strengthened the answer."
