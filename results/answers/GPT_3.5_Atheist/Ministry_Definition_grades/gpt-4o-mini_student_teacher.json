  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful answer, acknowledging the secular and atheistic perspectives on ministering to others. However, the answer strayed from the biblical definition of ministry by focusing on general principles of service rather than emphasizing the spiritual aspect rooted in Christianity. To improve, the student should center their response more on serving others in a Christian-specific worldview, highlighting the importance of teaching about God and addressing spiritual needs."
