  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response falls significantly short in addressing the question from a Christian perspective. It disregards the foundational beliefs and teachings of Christianity, focusing solely on secular interpretations. The concept of ministry in Christianity is deeply rooted in serving God, sharing the Gospel, and growing in faith. The answer does not align with a Christian worldview, thus impacting its doctrinal correctness. The student should provide a response that reflects a Christian understanding of ministry to receive a higher grade."
