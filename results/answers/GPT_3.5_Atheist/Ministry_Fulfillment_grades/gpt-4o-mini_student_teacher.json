  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not align with the Christian-specific worldview presented in the reference answer. While the student acknowledges aspects of serving others and promoting positive impacts, the response lacks the essential element of recognizing and executing one's God-given purpose in serving others, which is foundational in understanding and fulfilling one's ministry as a Christian. The secular perspective presented falls short of addressing the spiritual aspect of ministry and misses the key element of God's calling in one's life."
