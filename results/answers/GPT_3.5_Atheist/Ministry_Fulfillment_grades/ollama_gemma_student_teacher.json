While they do not adhere to Christian beliefs, they provide a secular interpretation that aligns with the concern expressed. The emphasis on serving others, promoting compassion, and contributing to societal betterment aligns with Christian values and demonstrates an understanding of fulfilling one's purpose. However, the lack of reference to a specific call or practice from God diminishes the response from a strictly Christian standpoint."
