As an atheistic scholar, the perspective provided lacks the foundational Christian belief in a higher calling and purpose bestowed by God. While the secular interpretation of serving others and promoting positive impact is commendable, it misses the core Christian aspect of fulfilling one's ministry in alignment with God's plan. A Christian worldview emphasizes the essential connection between serving others and fulfilling one's divine purpose, which the response does not capture."
