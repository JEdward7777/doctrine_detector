However, the answer lacks a strong Christian-specific perspective. It does not emphasize the biblical foundation of miracles, such as their purpose of revealing God\u2019s glory, validating His messengers, and confirming His Word. Additionally, the answer presents skepticism towards miracles without adequately addressing the theological significance of miracles within a Christian worldview. Encouraging a deeper dive into the biblical understanding of miracles and the importance of faith in interpreting them would strengthen the response."
