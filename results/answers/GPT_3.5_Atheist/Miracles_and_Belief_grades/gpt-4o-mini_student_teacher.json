  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student correctly mentions that miracles are often interpreted as signs pointing towards the existence of a higher power, such as God. However, the response falls short in emphasizing the role of miracles in leading others to faith in God, as the focus is more on personal belief and subjective interpretation. The student also introduces skepticism and alternative explanations for miracles, which detracts from the Christian perspective that miracles are indicators of God's power. To better align with a Christian worldview, the student should have emphasized that miracles are instrumental in prompting belief in God and validating His divine intervention in the world, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
