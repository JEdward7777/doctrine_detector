  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and balanced approach to the concept of miracles. They acknowledge the subjective interpretation of miracles and the influence of cultural and religious beliefs, while also offering a skeptical perspective. Their explanation of miracles as extraordinary occurrences that defy natural laws aligns with the Christian understanding of miracles as divine interventions. However, the student's secular perspective and skepticism towards attributing miracles solely to supernatural causes slightly lowers the grade."
