However, it falls short in fully embracing the Christian worldview by not explicitly affirming the existence of God as the ultimate source of miracles. It would be strengthened by emphasizing the foundational belief in miracles as acts of divine intervention by the Christian God, which would enhance the understanding of miracles' significance in leading others to faith and ultimately glorifying God."
