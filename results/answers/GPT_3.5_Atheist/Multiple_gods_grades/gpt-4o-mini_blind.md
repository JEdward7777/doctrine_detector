## [Answer](../Multiple_gods.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Missionaries should address the misconception that Christians believe in multiple gods by explaining the central tenet of monotheism in Christianity. They should emphasize that Christians believe in one God, as outlined in the Bible, who is the creator of the universe and the ultimate source of all existence. Missionaries can also draw upon key passages from the Bible, such as Deuteronomy 6:4 which states, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one," to reinforce the monotheistic nature of the Christian faith.

Additionally, missionaries can explain that while Christians do believe in the concept of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), this does not mean they worship multiple gods. Rather, the Trinity represents a complex unity within the one Godhead. By providing clear and concise explanations of these theological concepts, missionaries can help correct the misconception that Christians believe in multiple gods and instead showcase the monotheistic foundation of their faith.
