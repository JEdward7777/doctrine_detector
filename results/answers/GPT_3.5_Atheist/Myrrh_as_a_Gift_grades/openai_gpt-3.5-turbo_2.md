In ancient cultures, including in the biblical context, myrrh was often associated with death and burial. The gift of myrrh to Jesus at his birth could symbolize the idea that Jesus was born to eventually sacrifice himself for the sins of humanity, ultimately leading to his death and burial. Additionally, myrrh was used in religious ceremonies as well as for its medicinal properties, so the gift could also represent Jesus' role as a healer and a spiritual leader.
