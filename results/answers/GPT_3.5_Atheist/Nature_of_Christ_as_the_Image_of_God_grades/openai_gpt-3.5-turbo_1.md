# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Christian belief, Jesus is often described as the image of God because he is seen as the embodiment of divine qualities and attributes. This concept is rooted in the belief that Jesus, as the Son of God, reflects the nature of God in human form.

The significance of this belief lies in the idea that through Jesus, humans are able to better understand and connect with the divine. By observing Jesus' teachings and actions, Christians believe they can see the image of God reflected in him, which serves as a model for how they should live their own lives.

Furthermore, the belief in Jesus as the image of God reinforces the idea of his central role in Christian salvation. Through his life, death, and resurrection, Jesus is believed to have offered a way for humanity to be reconciled with God, emphasizing the importance of his divine nature in Christian theology.
