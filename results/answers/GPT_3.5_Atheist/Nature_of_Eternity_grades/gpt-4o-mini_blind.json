The response could be further enhanced by delving into the theological aspects of eternity, such as the nature of eternity in relation to God's eternal nature and the concept of the new heavens and new earth in Christian eschatology. Additionally, reinforcing scriptural references that support the Christian views on eternity would strengthen the answer."
