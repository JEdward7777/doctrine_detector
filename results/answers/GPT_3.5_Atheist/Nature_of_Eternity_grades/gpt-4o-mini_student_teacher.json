  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of eternity in the context of Christian beliefs, covering the concepts of endless existence, the afterlife, heaven, hell, and the presence or separation from God. However, the student's answer is slightly more detailed than necessary and includes additional information that goes beyond the core definition provided in the reference answer. It could have been improved by focusing more on the fundamental concept of eternity as a state of being without beginning or end in connection with God or separation from Him."
