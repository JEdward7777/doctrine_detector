  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a general overview of exhortation in the New Testament, their answer lacked a specific Christian perspective on how exhortation should be delivered in a loving and supportive manner as emphasized in the reference answer. From a Christian worldview, exhortation is not just about urging others to live according to Christian teachings, but it should be done with love and care for the individual's well-being. The student's response missed addressing this vital aspect of exhortation in the Christian faith."
