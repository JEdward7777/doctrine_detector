  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately addresses the concern of ensuring encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner. The student correctly points out that exhortation in the New Testament emphasizes the importance of mutual support and encouragement within the Christian community as a means of strengthening individual faith and promoting collective well-being. However, the answer lacks a specific focus on Christian principles or interpretations of relevant scriptures, which would have elevated the grade."
