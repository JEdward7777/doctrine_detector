# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I approach this question from a cultural and historical perspective rather than a religious one. 

In the context of the New Testament, exhortation is often seen as a form of encouragement, urging others to live according to the teachings of Christianity. The Apostle Paul, in his letters to various Christian communities, frequently exhorts believers to remain faithful, persevere in their faith, and to live in a manner that is pleasing to God.

From a cultural standpoint, exhortation can be seen as a way for individuals within a community to support and uplift one another, fostering a sense of unity and common purpose. It can serve as a reminder of shared values and beliefs, and can motivate individuals to strive for personal growth and moral development.

Overall, the approach to exhortation in the New Testament emphasizes the importance of mutual support and encouragement within the Christian community, as a means of strengthening individual faith and promoting collective well-being.

Grade: 60

Comment: While the response provides a comprehensive understanding of exhortation from both a biblical and cultural perspective, it falls short of directly addressing the concern of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner. The emphasis on mutual support and encouragement within the Christian community is relevant, but the explicit connection to exhorting in love as highlighted in the provided answer is somewhat lacking. A more direct integration of the importance of love in exhortation would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
