  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned analysis of exhortation from a cultural and historical perspective, aligning with the Christian value of encouraging one another in love. It acknowledges the importance of delivering encouragement in a loving and supportive manner, which reflects the concern raised in the given answer. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the significance of love as a foundational principle in exhortation within Christian communities."
