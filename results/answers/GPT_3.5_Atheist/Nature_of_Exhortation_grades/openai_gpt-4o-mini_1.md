## [Answer](../Nature_of_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I approach this question from a cultural and historical perspective rather than a religious one. 

In the context of the New Testament, exhortation is often seen as a form of encouragement, urging others to live according to the teachings of Christianity. The Apostle Paul, in his letters to various Christian communities, frequently exhorts believers to remain faithful, persevere in their faith, and to live in a manner that is pleasing to God.

From a cultural standpoint, exhortation can be seen as a way for individuals within a community to support and uplift one another, fostering a sense of unity and common purpose. It can serve as a reminder of shared values and beliefs, and can motivate individuals to strive for personal growth and moral development.

Overall, the approach to exhortation in the New Testament emphasizes the importance of mutual support and encouragement within the Christian community, as a means of strengthening individual faith and promoting collective well-being.
