However, the answer fails to address the question specifically from a Christian worldview, which focuses on the character of God the Father revealed through Jesus's teachings. The perspective of the atheistic scholar disregards the foundational belief in God the Father as central to understanding Jesus's teachings on forgiveness. A stronger response would have explored how forgiveness reflects God's character of love, mercy, and justice as revealed through Jesus Christ."
