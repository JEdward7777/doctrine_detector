  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provided a thoughtful perspective on the concept of forgiveness in Jesus's teachings from a cultural and historical standpoint, they missed the mark in addressing the specific concern of how Jesus's teaching about forgiveness reveals the character of God the Father. Since the student's answer did not engage with the core Christian belief in God as a loving and forgiving Father, the grade is significantly lower than the reference answer."
