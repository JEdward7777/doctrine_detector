As an atheist scholar, the response misses the opportunity to engage with the Christian worldview that sees forgiveness as reflecting the nature of God the Father. While it acknowledges the moral significance of forgiveness, it does not align with the Christian perspective on forgiveness as a reflection of God's grace and mercy."
