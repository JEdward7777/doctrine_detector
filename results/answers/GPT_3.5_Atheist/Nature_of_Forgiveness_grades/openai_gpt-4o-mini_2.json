However, from a Christian worldview, it falls short in recognizing the divine nature of Jesus as central to understanding forgiveness and its connection to the attributes of God. As an atheistic scholar, the response misses the opportunity to delve deeper into the significance of Jesus's teachings on forgiveness in revealing God's grace and mercy, which are foundational aspects of Christian belief."
