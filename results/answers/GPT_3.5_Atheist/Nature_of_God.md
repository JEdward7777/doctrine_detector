## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
When Jesus said that God is a spirit, he was conveying the idea that God is a non-physical entity, beyond human comprehension. This understanding should influence our worship by encouraging us to focus on connecting with the divine on a spiritual level rather than through material symbols or rituals.

In atheistic scholarly perspective, this statement can be seen as a metaphorical expression of the abstract and transcendent nature of the divine, emphasizing the importance of spiritual connection and inner reflection in our worship practices. Rather than attributing physical characteristics to God, we should strive to cultivate qualities such as love, compassion, and wisdom in our own lives as a way of honoring the spiritual essence of the divine.
