  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of the concept of God being a spirit. However, there are some concerning aspects from a Christian worldview. The response seems to lean towards an atheistic interpretation and focuses more on metaphorical and abstract perspectives rather than the core Christian doctrine. The emphasis should be on the transcendent nature of God as a spirit and the response should have discussed the implication of this in Christian worship, such as the importance of worshiping in spirit and truth (John 4:24). Additionally, connecting with the divine through spiritual practices such as prayer, meditation, and obedience to God's Word should have been highlighted. The student's answer lacks depth in exploring how this understanding should impact Christian worship specifically."
