  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student accurately explains the concept of God as a non-physical entity and acknowledges the need for spiritual engagement in worship. However, there are some elements of the student's answer, such as emphasizing atheistic scholarly perspectives and focusing more on human qualities, that deviate from a Christian worldview. The student could strengthen their response by explicitly referencing the importance of faith, prayer, and personal relationship with God in worship within a Christian framework."
