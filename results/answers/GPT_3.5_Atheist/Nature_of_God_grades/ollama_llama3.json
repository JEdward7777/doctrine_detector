  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response adequately addresses the concern of understanding the essence of God and how to connect with Him in worship, correctly interpreting Jesus' statement about God being a spirit as conveying the idea that God is beyond human comprehension and that our worship should focus on spiritual connection. The mention of cultivating qualities such as love, compassion, and wisdom in our own lives as a way of honoring the divine essence is also a valuable insight.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are:\n\n1. The language used is quite formal and academic, which may not be engaging or relatable to all readers.\n2. There is no explicit mention of Jesus' character or His relationship with God as the Father, which would have further emphasized the importance of spiritual connection in worship.\n\nOverall, however, the response provides a clear and thoughtful explanation of how understanding God's spirit-ness can inform our worship practices, making it a strong response that demonstrates a good grasp of the concern."
