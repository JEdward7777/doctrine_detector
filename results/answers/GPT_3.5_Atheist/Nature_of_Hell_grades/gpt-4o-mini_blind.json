The response could have elaborated more on the biblical passages that discuss Hell, such as Matthew 25:41 and Revelation 20:12-15, to provide a more doctrinally accurate explanation. Additionally, while it is important to acknowledge diversity in Christian beliefs, the focus should have been on presenting the biblical teachings on Hell rather than emphasizing a secular perspective."
