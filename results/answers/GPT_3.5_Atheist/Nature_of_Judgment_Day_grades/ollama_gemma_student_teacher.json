They accurately referenced relevant scriptures and clearly articulated the consequences associated with this event. Additionally, the response effectively emphasizes the importance of living a righteous life and the belief in divine justice. \n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from a more elaborate explanation of the process of judgment and the specific criteria used by God to assess individuals. Including some elaboration on the concept of grace and redemption would also enhance the depth of the response."
