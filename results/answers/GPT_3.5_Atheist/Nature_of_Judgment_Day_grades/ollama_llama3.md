In a Christian context according to the Bible, "judgment day" refers to the belief that there will be a day of reckoning when God will judge all humanity. This concept is mainly derived from passages in the New Testament, such as Matthew 25:31-46 and Revelation 20:11-15.

On judgment day, it is believed that individuals will be held accountable for their actions and will be rewarded or punished accordingly. Those who accepted Jesus Christ as their savior and lived according to his teachings are thought to be granted eternal life in heaven, while those who rejected him are believed to face eternal damnation in hell.
