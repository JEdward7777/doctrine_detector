  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical account of manna and provides a well-reasoned analysis of its appearance and taste. They accurately summarize the physical description of manna as white flakes and its sweet honey-like taste. Additionally, their consideration of the cultural context and the symbolic significance of the story is insightful. While their personal interpretation as an atheist scholar adds an additional perspective, it is not directly relevant to the Christian-specific worldview used for grading."
