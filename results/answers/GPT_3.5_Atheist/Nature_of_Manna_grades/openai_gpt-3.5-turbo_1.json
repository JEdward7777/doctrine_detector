However, it fails to delve into the deeper significance of manna as a miraculous provision of God for the Israelites during their time in the wilderness. The atheistic interpretation also overlooks the crucial aspect of divine intervention and the significance of faith in the story of manna. An understanding of the miraculous provision of God is essential to fully grasp the spiritual implications of this biblical event."
