  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While the student attempts to offer a historical perspective on the miracles attributed to Jesus, they completely dismiss the foundational Christian belief in Jesus' divine nature and authority. From a Christian worldview, the miracles performed by Jesus were not merely a way to elevate his status or establish his reputation, but rather direct manifestations of his unique identity as the Son of God. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to acknowledge the central tenet of Jesus' miracles as evidence of his divinity."
