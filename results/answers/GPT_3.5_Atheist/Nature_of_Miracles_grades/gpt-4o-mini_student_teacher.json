  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-articulated perspective on how miracles attributed to Jesus may have been used to elevate his status within the religious community of his time. However, the student failed to address the concern of understanding the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature from a Christian worldview. The student's viewpoint from an atheistic perspective lacks the acknowledgment of the core belief in Jesus's divinity, which is crucial in interpreting the significance of His miracles in affirming His identity as the Son of God."
