  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 70\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a thoughtful and well-reasoned analysis of the possible social and cultural significance of Jesus' miracles. However, they fail to address the concern of the prompt, which specifically asks about the miracles affirming Jesus' divine nature. While the student's explanation of the miracles as social and cultural phenomena is valid, it does not adequately respond to the question from the Christian perspective."
