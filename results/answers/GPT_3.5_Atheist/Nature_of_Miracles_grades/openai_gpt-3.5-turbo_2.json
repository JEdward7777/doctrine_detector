From a Christian worldview, the primary significance of Jesus's miracles is to demonstrate his divinity and authority as the Son of God. This response, although insightful in discussing the socio-cultural implications of miracles, does not fully engage with the Christian belief regarding the purpose and significance of Jesus's miracles in revealing His divine nature."
