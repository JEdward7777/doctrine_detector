  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the relationship between 'scripture' and 'the word of God' in the biblical context, highlighting the distinction between written scripture and God's spoken word. The response demonstrates a good understanding of how these terms are related within Christian belief. However, the student could have further emphasized the specific biblical context and the centrality of the Hebrew scriptures (Old Testament) in defining scripture and the word of God. Overall, a solid and well-informed answer."
