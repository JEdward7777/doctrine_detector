It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word. The only room for improvement would be to further emphasize the divine inspiration and authority attributed to both scripture and the spoken word of God in the Christian worldview. Overall, a solid response with a Christian-specific perspective."
