It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how the 'word of God' extends beyond written scripture to include divine messages delivered through various means, including Jesus. The explanation is thorough and aligns well with a Christian worldview, showcasing a solid understanding of the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word."
