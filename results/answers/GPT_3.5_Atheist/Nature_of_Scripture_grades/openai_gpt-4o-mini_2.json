  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the distinction between 'scripture' and 'the word of God' within a Christian context, addressing the concern about clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word. The response effectively highlights the broader meaning of 'the word of God' beyond written texts and acknowledges the dynamic nature of God's communication with humanity. However, the response could have further emphasized the centrality of Jesus as the ultimate expression of the Word of God in Christian belief, which would have strengthened the Christian-specific perspective."
