From a Christian standpoint, sinful nature is viewed as a result of the Fall and humanity's inherent separation from God due to Adam and Eve's disobedience. External influences, in a Christian context, can include the influence of the world, the flesh, and the devil. Integrating these Christian beliefs would have strengthened the answer."
