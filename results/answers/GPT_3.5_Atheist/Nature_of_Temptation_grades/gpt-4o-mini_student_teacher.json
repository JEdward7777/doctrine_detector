  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation on the role of our sinful nature and external influences in temptation from a secular perspective. However, the key Christian teaching perspective on how our sinful nature drives us to desire what is wrong, and how external influences like other people and Satan can tempt us to sin, is missing. To enhance the grade, it's important for the student to incorporate Christian teachings on the origins and sources of temptation into their answer."
