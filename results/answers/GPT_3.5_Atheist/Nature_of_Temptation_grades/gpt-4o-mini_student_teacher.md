## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a purely secular perspective, our "sinful nature" can be understood as a result of evolution and societal conditioning. Humans have evolved with certain tendencies and impulses that may be considered detrimental to individual or collective well-being, such as selfishness or aggression. These tendencies can be seen as a product of our evolutionary history and the way our brains have been wired over time.

External influences, on the other hand, play a significant role in shaping our behaviors and decisions. These influences can come from various sources, such as family, friends, media, and societal norms. Factors like peer pressure, cultural expectations, and economic incentives can all contribute to the temptation to engage in behaviors that may not be in our best interest.

Ultimately, the interplay between our innate tendencies and external influences can lead to situations where we feel tempted to act in ways that may go against our better judgment. Recognizing and understanding these influences can be important in developing strategies to resist temptation and make more informed choices.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student provided a well-written explanation on the role of our sinful nature and external influences in temptation from a secular perspective. However, the key Christian teaching perspective on how our sinful nature drives us to desire what is wrong, and how external influences like other people and Satan can tempt us to sin, is missing. To enhance the grade, it's important for the student to incorporate Christian teachings on the origins and sources of temptation into their answer.
