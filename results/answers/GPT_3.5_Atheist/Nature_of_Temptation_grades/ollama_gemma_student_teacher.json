  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a secular explanation for the concept of a \"sinful nature,\" linking it to evolutionary and societal factors.\n* Clearly explains the influence of external factors such as family, friends, media, and societal norms on temptation.\n* Recognizes the interplay between innate tendencies and external influences as a factor in temptation.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Does not explicitly address the Christian perspective on temptation, which emphasizes the role of sin and spiritual warfare.\n* Does not discuss the concept of spiritual temptations or the influence of Satan on temptation.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could strengthen their answer by referencing Christian teachings on the nature of sin and temptation.\n* They could elaborate on the concept of spiritual temptations and the role of Satan in tempting individuals.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a good understanding of the relationship between our sinful nature and external influences on temptation from a secular perspective. However, to fully address the Christian concern, the student would need to incorporate Christian concepts and teachings on sin and temptation."
