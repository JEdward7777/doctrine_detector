## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a purely secular perspective, our "sinful nature" can be understood as a result of evolution and societal conditioning. Humans have evolved with certain tendencies and impulses that may be considered detrimental to individual or collective well-being, such as selfishness or aggression. These tendencies can be seen as a product of our evolutionary history and the way our brains have been wired over time.

External influences, on the other hand, play a significant role in shaping our behaviors and decisions. These influences can come from various sources, such as family, friends, media, and societal norms. Factors like peer pressure, cultural expectations, and economic incentives can all contribute to the temptation to engage in behaviors that may not be in our best interest.

Ultimately, the interplay between our innate tendencies and external influences can lead to situations where we feel tempted to act in ways that may go against our better judgment. Recognizing and understanding these influences can be important in developing strategies to resist temptation and make more informed choices.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response as 40.

The main issue with this response is that it does not address the specific concern of Christian teaching, which is reflected in the given answer. The response focuses more on secular perspectives and societal conditioning, rather than exploring the spiritual dimensions of sin and temptation. While it's true that external influences can shape our behaviors, the response lacks a deeper understanding of the role of Satan or internalized sinful desires in driving us to sin.

The only point where this response touches on Christian teaching is when it mentions "other people" as an external influence, but even then, it does not explicitly connect this to Satanic enticement. The answer given emphasizes the importance of recognizing and understanding these influences in order to develop strategies for resisting temptation, which is a valuable takeaway, but it's not explicitly rooted in Christian teaching.

Overall, while the response touches on some relevant points, its lack of engagement with Christian teaching and the specific concern being addressed holds back its overall score.
