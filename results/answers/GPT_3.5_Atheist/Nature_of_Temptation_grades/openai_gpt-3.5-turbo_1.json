While these factors can contribute to human tendencies and influences, it lacks the Christian-specific understanding that emphasizes the role of our sinful nature and external spiritual influences, such as Satan. The response would benefit from incorporating a Christian worldview to align more closely with the understanding of temptation as taught in Christianity."
