## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, individuals are considered wicked when they engage in actions that harm others, go against moral principles, or defy the will of God. Some examples of wicked behavior highlighted in the Bible include lying, cheating, stealing, murder, and idolatry.

The Bible often portrays the state of wicked individuals as being characterized by spiritual emptiness, moral corruption, and separation from God. Psalm 37:1-2, for example, states, "Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong; for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away." This suggests that the wicked may prosper temporarily but ultimately face a negative outcome.

In Proverbs 11:21, it is mentioned, "Be sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished, but those who are righteous will go free." This verse conveys the idea that there will be consequences for wicked actions and that justice will prevail in the end.

Overall, the Bible emphasizes the importance of living a righteous and virtuous life, and warns against engaging in wicked behavior that can lead to negative consequences and distance from God.
