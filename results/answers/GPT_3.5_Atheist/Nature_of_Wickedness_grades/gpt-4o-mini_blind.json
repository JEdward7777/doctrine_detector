The references to Psalms and Proverbs help support the points made. However, the answer could be improved by incorporating more specific examples of individuals in the Bible who were considered wicked and how their actions led to their downfall, as this would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the concept of wickedness in a biblical context. Remember to always strive for depth and specificity when discussing Biblical concepts."
