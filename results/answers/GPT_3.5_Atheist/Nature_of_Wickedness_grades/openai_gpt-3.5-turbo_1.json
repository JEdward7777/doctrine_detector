  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of how the Bible views wickedness as disobedience to God and immoral actions leading to disconnection from righteousness and favor with God. It discusses biblical passages that highlight consequences for wicked behavior and emphasizes the importance of living a righteous life.

Providing more specific examples or practical applications would enhance the analysis in relation to the concern raised."
