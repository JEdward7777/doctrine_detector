  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and insightful explanation of the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible. They correctly note the general understanding of the soul as encompassing emotions, will, and personality, and the spirit as the divine spark connecting individuals to God. The student shows a good understanding of the nuances of the concepts, even though they acknowledge that the distinction is not always clear-cut in the Bible. Overall, the student's response aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, but could have been improved by providing more specific biblical examples to support their explanation."
