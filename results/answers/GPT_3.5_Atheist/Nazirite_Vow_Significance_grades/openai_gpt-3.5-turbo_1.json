  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a partial but somewhat accurate summary of the key restrictions of the Nazirite vow. It correctly mentions abstaining from food or drink made from grapes, not cutting one's hair, and not going near a dead body. However, to improve the grade, more depth could have been added by elaborating on the spiritual significance and purpose of these restrictions within the biblical context of consecration and dedication to God under the Nazirite vow."
