  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The provided response accurately captures the key restrictions of the Nazirite vow, but it lacks depth in explaining the purpose and significance of the vow within the biblical context. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to elaborate on how the Nazirite vow symbolizes consecration, dedication to God, and separation from worldly influences in the Old Testament. A more thorough explanation of the spiritual implications and reasons behind the restrictions would enhance the response."
