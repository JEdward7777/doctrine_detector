  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided an accurate summary of the key restrictions of the Nazirite vow, including abstaining from grape products, not cutting one's hair, and avoiding contact with a dead body. However, the response lacks depth in explaining the purpose and significance of the Nazirite vow within its biblical context. To improve the grade, a deeper exploration of the spiritual and symbolic meanings behind these restrictions would have been beneficial."
