  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response accurately lists some of the key restrictions of the Nazirite vow, but it lacks depth in explaining the purpose and significance of the vow in a biblical context. To improve the grade, the response should include more detailed insight into why the Nazirite vow was established and its spiritual significance within the biblical narrative."
