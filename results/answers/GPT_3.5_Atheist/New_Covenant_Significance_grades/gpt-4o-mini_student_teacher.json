However, the answer did not fully address the concern of recognizing the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises. The focus on the departure from old religious practices and the development of Christianity as a separate religion was well-explained, but the central aspect of Jesus' sacrifice as atonement for sins and the fulfillment of God's promises was not sufficiently emphasized. The answer could have been strengthened by delving deeper into the theological implications of Jesus' sacrifice and how it relates to God's promises in the context of the new covenant."
