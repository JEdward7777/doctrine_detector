## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, Christians receive various instructions and insights regarding the Psalms. One key aspect is that Jesus and the apostles often quoted from the Psalms, showing their significance and authority in Christian teachings. 

For example, Jesus quoted Psalm 22 while on the cross, saying "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This not only fulfilled the prophecy in the Psalm but also highlighted Jesus' identification with human suffering.

Additionally, the apostle Paul encouraged Christians to use the Psalms for worship, teaching, and admonition. In Ephesians 5:19, he urges believers to "speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs." This shows the relevance of the Psalms for personal and communal worship among early Christians.

Overall, the New Testament presents the Psalms as a valuable resource for spiritual growth, encouragement, and understanding of God's character and promises. Christians are encouraged to engage with the Psalms as part of their devotional life and theological reflection.
