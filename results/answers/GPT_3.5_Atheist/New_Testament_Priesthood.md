## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of believers in Jesus being considered as priests is rooted in the idea of the "priesthood of all believers." This concept emphasizes that all believers have direct access to God and do not need intermediaries, such as priests, to communicate with or serve God.

This idea is derived from passages such as 1 Peter 2:9, which states, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." This verse highlights the idea that all believers have a special and direct relationship with God and are called to serve and proclaim his message.

Therefore, in the New Testament, every believer in Jesus is considered a priest in the sense that they have a direct connection to God and are called to share the message of the gospel with others. This does not mean that believers take on the traditional roles and duties of priests in the Old Testament sense, but rather that they have a unique and important role in spreading the teachings of Jesus and living out their faith in their daily lives.
