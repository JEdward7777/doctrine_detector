The mention of not taking on traditional roles of priests from the Old Testament is correct. However, the explanation could be enhanced by diving deeper into the significance of the priestly role in terms of intercession and impartation of spiritual blessings. Additionally, connecting the priesthood of believers to the role of Christ as the ultimate High Priest would provide a more comprehensive understanding."
