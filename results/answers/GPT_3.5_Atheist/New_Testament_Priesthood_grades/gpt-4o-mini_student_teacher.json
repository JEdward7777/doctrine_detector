  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers, drawing from biblical passages like 1 Peter 2:9. They correctly emphasize the direct access to God that believers have and their role in proclaiming the gospel. However, the teacher's reference answer is more concise and directly focuses on the key aspect of believers acting as priests to intercede through prayer. The student could have emphasized more the aspect of intercession in their response to align it closer to the teacher's reference answer."
