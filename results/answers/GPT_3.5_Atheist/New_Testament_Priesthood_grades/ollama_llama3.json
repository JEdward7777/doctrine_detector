  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately reflects the concept of the priesthood of all believers, highlighting that every believer in Jesus has direct access to God and can intercede for themselves and others. The response also provides relevant biblical support from 1 Peter 2:9, which emphasizes the idea that believers are a royal priesthood with a special relationship with God.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are:\n\n* A brief explanation of how this concept is rooted in the New Testament would have strengthened the response.\n* While the response correctly states that every believer is considered a priest, it could have expanded on what this means in practical terms, such as serving and proclaiming God's message.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the priesthood of all believers and provides relevant biblical support."
