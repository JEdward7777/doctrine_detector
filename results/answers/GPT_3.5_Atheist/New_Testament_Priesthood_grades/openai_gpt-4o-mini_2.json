The explanation effectively conveys the idea that all believers have direct access to God and are called to serve and proclaim His message, while clarifying that this does not entail taking on the traditional roles of Old Testament priests. The response could have benefitted from further elaboration on the implications of believers being priests, such as the responsibility to offer spiritual sacrifices or to act as conduits for God's grace, but overall it demonstrates a strong grasp of the central idea."
