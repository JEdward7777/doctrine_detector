## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, purification rituals were an integral part of Jewish religious practices, primarily focused on cleansing oneself from physical impurities or sins through various sacrifices, rituals, and ceremonies. These practices were often symbolically linked to maintaining ritual purity before God.

In contrast, the New Testament emphasizes a more spiritual understanding of purification. Jesus Christ is portrayed as the ultimate purifier who cleanses believers from their sins through his sacrificial death and resurrection. The focus shifts from external rituals to internal transformation and righteousness through faith in Christ.

Therefore, while purification in the Old Testament was largely ritualistic and outwardly focused, in the New Testament it is more about inner renewal and salvation through Christ. The concept of purification evolves from being a ritualistic practice to a spiritual transformation in the New Testament.
