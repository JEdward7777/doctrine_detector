The explanation is clear and accurate, but could benefit from a deeper examination of how the Old Testament rituals pointed towards the need for a spiritual purification that Christ would fulfill in the New Testament. Additionally, connecting the concept of purification to broader theological themes such as sanctification and justification in the New Testament would enhance the answer."
