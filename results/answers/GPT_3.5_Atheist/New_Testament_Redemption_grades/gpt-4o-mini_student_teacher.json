  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a good understanding of the evolution of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament, highlighting the shift from external rituals to internal transformation through Christ. However, the student's answer could have been improved by emphasizing more on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, as indicated in the teacher's reference answer. It is important to recognize and emphasize the centrality of Christ's sacrifice in understanding purification from a Christian worldview."
