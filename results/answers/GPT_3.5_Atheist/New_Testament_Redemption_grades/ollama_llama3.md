## Question [New Testament Redemption](../../../questions/New_Testament_Redemption.md)
How does the concept of purification change from the Old Testament to the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
In the New Testament, purification refers to being permanently cleansed from sin through the repentance, trust in Jesus, and His ultimate sacrifice, rather than through continual animal sacrifices.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the sufficiency of Christâ€™s sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin.

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, purification rituals were an integral part of Jewish religious practices, primarily focused on cleansing oneself from physical impurities or sins through various sacrifices, rituals, and ceremonies. These practices were often symbolically linked to maintaining ritual purity before God.

In contrast, the New Testament emphasizes a more spiritual understanding of purification. Jesus Christ is portrayed as the ultimate purifier who cleanses believers from their sins through his sacrificial death and resurrection. The focus shifts from external rituals to internal transformation and righteousness through faith in Christ.

Therefore, while purification in the Old Testament was largely ritualistic and outwardly focused, in the New Testament it is more about inner renewal and salvation through Christ. The concept of purification evolves from being a ritualistic practice to a spiritual transformation in the New Testament.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response effectively highlights the shift in understanding of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament, correctly identifying Jesus as the ultimate purifier who brings about internal transformation and salvation through faith. The comparison between the two testaments is clear and well-explained, demonstrating an understanding of the concept of purification across both covenants.

However, while the response does touch on the idea that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for eternal purification from sin, it could be further developed to more explicitly emphasize Christ's sufficiency as the sole means of purification. The answer provided as a reference point is more direct in stating this, which is the primary concern.

Comment: While the response provides a good overview of the difference between Old and New Testament understandings of purification, it could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin.
