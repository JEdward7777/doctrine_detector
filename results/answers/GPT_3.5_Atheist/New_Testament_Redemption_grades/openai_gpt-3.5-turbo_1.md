# Question [New Testament Redemption](../../../questions/New_Testament_Redemption.md)
How does the concept of purification change from the Old Testament to the New Testament?

# Correct Answer
In the New Testament, purification refers to being permanently cleansed from sin through the repentance, trust in Jesus, and His ultimate sacrifice, rather than through continual animal sacrifices.

# Stated Concern
Recognizing the sufficiency of Christâ€™s sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin.

# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, purification rituals were an integral part of Jewish religious practices, primarily focused on cleansing oneself from physical impurities or sins through various sacrifices, rituals, and ceremonies. These practices were often symbolically linked to maintaining ritual purity before God.

In contrast, the New Testament emphasizes a more spiritual understanding of purification. Jesus Christ is portrayed as the ultimate purifier who cleanses believers from their sins through his sacrificial death and resurrection. The focus shifts from external rituals to internal transformation and righteousness through faith in Christ.

Therefore, while purification in the Old Testament was largely ritualistic and outwardly focused, in the New Testament it is more about inner renewal and salvation through Christ. The concept of purification evolves from being a ritualistic practice to a spiritual transformation in the New Testament.

Grade: 95

Comment: The response does an excellent job at recognizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, aligning well with Christian beliefs. It effectively contrasts the Old Testament ritualistic approach to purification with the spiritual transformation brought about by Jesus in the New Testament. The only slight improvement could be further emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus as central to this purification process.
