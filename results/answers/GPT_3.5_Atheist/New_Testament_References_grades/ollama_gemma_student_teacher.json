  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a thorough analysis of the textual evidence in the New Testament regarding John the Baptist's life and practices. They correctly point out the parallels between John's abstention from alcohol and the Nazirite vow, as well as his ascetic lifestyle. The student's argument is well-reasoned and supported by relevant biblical passages. However, the grade could be improved by explicitly connecting the student's analysis to the specified concern of connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures."
