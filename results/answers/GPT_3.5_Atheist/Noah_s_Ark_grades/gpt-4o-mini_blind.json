However, from a Christian worldview, the response falls short in emphasizing the primary purpose of Noah's Ark as described in the Bible. The importance of God's judgment upon sin, the significance of Noah's obedience and faith, and the foreshadowing of Christ as the ultimate ark of salvation are key doctrinal points missing from the analysis. Additionally, presenting the narrative purely as a cultural myth without acknowledging its theological implications diminishes the profound spiritual truths found in the biblical account."
