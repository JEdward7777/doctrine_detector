However, the answer lacked a clear understanding of God's plan for salvation and preservation as depicted in the biblical narrative, which was the specific concern given. The response would benefit from a stronger emphasis on the role of divine judgment and mercy in the context of God's plan for salvation through the preservation of Noah and the living creatures on the ark."
