  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the purpose of Noah's Ark from both a biblical and cultural perspective. It concisely explains the divine judgment, Noah's obedience, and the ark as a means of preservation. The inclusion of the atheistic perspective provides a well-rounded analysis, acknowledging the differing interpretations of the story. However, the grade could be improved by providing more specific examples or textual evidence from the Bible to support the claims made about the story's purpose."
