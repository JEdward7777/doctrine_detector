However, it falls short of explicitly connecting the purpose of the ark to God's plan for salvation and preservation, which is a key aspect from a Christian worldview. Encouraging more explicit linkage to God's judgment on humanity and His provision of safety through the ark would enhance the understanding of God's plan in this narrative."
