  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response discusses the purpose of Noah's Ark in protecting Noah, his family, and the animals in line with God's judgment on humanity. The student appropriately acknowledges the divine aspect of the narrative and the theme of salvation and preservation. However, the response also includes perspectives that undermine the significance of the Biblical narrative by presenting an atheistic viewpoint that dismisses the story as merely a product of ancient myth-making. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on emphasizing the importance of understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation within the context of the Noah's Ark narrative, without diluting its divine significance with secular interpretations."
