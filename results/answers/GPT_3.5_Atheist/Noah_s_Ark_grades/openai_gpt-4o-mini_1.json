The Christian worldview of understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative of Noah's Ark is clearly articulated. The only room for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of divine mercy, faith, and obedience in the context of God's ultimate plan for the salvation of His chosen people."
