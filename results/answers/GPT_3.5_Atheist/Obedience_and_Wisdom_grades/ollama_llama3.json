  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges that seeking knowledge, reflecting on experiences, and learning from others can lead to wisdom, which is a good starting point. However, it fails to explicitly recognize the link between obedience to God and wisdom as emphasized in the concern. While the author mentions critical thinking, self-reflection, and continuous learning as ways to develop wisdom, these methods are not necessarily tied to listening to God or humbly obeying His will. The response could benefit from a more explicit connection between spiritual growth and the pursuit of wisdom."
