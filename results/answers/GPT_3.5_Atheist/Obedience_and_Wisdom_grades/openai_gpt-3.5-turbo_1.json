While it lacks acknowledgment of the Christian worldview of obedience to God as a source of wisdom, the response effectively presents an alternative approach to wisdom attainment. From a Christian perspective, integrating obedience to God as a central component of wisdom would further enrich the understanding of how spirituality can enhance one's journey towards wisdom."
