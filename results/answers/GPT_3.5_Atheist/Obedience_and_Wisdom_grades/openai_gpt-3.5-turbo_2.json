While the scholar offers a perspective on wisdom based on critical thinking and self-reflection, it falls short of acknowledging the spiritual aspect of obedience to God as essential for true wisdom. From a Christian perspective, wisdom is not merely about intellectual pursuits but also about aligning one's life with God's purposes and teachings."
