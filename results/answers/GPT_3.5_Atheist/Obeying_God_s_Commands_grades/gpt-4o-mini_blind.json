The explanation is clear and accurately reflects the biblical perspective on the role of the Mosaic Law in the covenant relationship. The answer could be enhanced by incorporating specific references to biblical passages or key theological concepts related to the covenant, but overall, it is doctrinally sound. Well done!"
