The inclusion of various examples aligns with biblical teachings on folly, such as idolatry, pride, greed, dishonesty, oppression, immorality, injustice, and refusal to repent.

Additionally, the answer could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of repentance and seeking forgiveness in the context of folly.
