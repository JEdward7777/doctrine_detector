  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of actions considered folly in a biblical context, aligning well with the reference answer. The response demonstrates a good understanding of how folly is viewed within Christian teachings. However, the inclusion of the note regarding interpretations among denominations and broader perspectives detracts slightly from the focus on recognizing folly aligned with God's will. Overall, a solid response."
