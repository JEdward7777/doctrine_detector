## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, atonement is often portrayed as a way to reconcile with God through the offering of sacrifices, particularly animal sacrifices, to atone for sins. The idea was that the shedding of blood was necessary for the forgiveness of sins, as stated in Leviticus 17:11: "For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life."

In contrast, the New Testament understanding of atonement is centered on the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ as the ultimate atonement for humanity's sins. According to Christian belief, Jesus' death on the cross served as a perfect and once-for-all sacrifice that reconciled humanity with God, eliminating the need for any further sacrifices. This concept is emphasized in passages such as Hebrews 9:12, which states: "He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption."

Overall, while the Old Testament emphasizes the importance of sacrificial offerings to atone for sins, the New Testament presents Jesus Christ as the ultimate atonement, whose death on the cross provides forgiveness and reconciliation with God for all who believe in Him.
