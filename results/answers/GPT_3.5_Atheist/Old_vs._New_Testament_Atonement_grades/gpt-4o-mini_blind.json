  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response offers a clear and concise explanation of the differences between the concept of atonement in the Old Testament and the New Testament. The student correctly highlights the shift from animal sacrifices in the Old Testament to the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ in the New Testament as the ultimate atonement for sins. The biblical references provided are relevant and support the explanation given. The only minor improvement could be to further elaborate on the significance of Jesus Christ as the perfect and final sacrifice in bringing about redemption for humanity. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
