The transition from temporary to permanent atonement is clarified through the explanation that Jesus' death on the cross serves as a perfect and final sacrifice, eliminating the need for further sacrifices.\n\nWhile the response could be strengthened by providing more specific biblical references and developing the idea further, it effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The language is clear and concise, making it accessible to readers."
