It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for all sins forever, highlighting the significant shift in atonement theology across biblical history. The response is well-grounded in Christian beliefs and effectively demonstrates the redemptive work of Jesus Christ as the ultimate atonement."
