  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe answer demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of emphasizing the uniqueness and supremacy of the monotheistic God in cultures that respect multiple deities. It correctly suggests using language and imagery to highlight the power and omnipotence of this deity. Additionally, the mention of providing explanations or footnotes to clarify monotheistic belief and differentiate it from polytheistic beliefs shows a thoughtful approach. However, the response could have been strengthened by including references to specific biblical passages or principles that support the emphasis on 'One God' in the Bible. Overall, a solid response with room for enhancement."
