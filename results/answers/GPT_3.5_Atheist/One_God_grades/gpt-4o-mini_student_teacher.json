  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the uniqueness and supremacy of the one God when translating the Bible for cultures with multiple deities. The response also suggests using language and imagery that differentiate this single deity from others, which aligns well with the concern provided. However, the student could have further strengthened their answer by explicitly mentioning the Trinity as a crucial aspect of Christian monotheism."
