The suggested approach of highlighting the supremacy and uniqueness of God in contrast to cultural polytheism is consistent with a Christian worldview. Adding further emphasis on the deity's attributes of power, omnipotence, and all-encompassing nature could enhance the response, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern provided."
