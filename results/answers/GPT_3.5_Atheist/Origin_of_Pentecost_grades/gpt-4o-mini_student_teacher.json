  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student accurately discussed the historical and religious significance of the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot) before the events described in the New Testament, mentioning its origins as an agricultural festival and its association with the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. The connection was made between the Jewish tradition of Shavuot and its incorporation into Christian tradition as Pentecost. However, the student could have strengthened their response by linking the festival more explicitly to its fulfillment in Christ, as the concern indicated."
