The mention of the festival's importance in Jewish tradition and its incorporation into Christian tradition as Pentecost is relevant. However, the response could further emphasize and elaborate on how Pentecost is seen as the fulfillment of the Festival of Weeks in Christ, highlighting the connection between the two in a more explicit manner from a Christian worldview."
