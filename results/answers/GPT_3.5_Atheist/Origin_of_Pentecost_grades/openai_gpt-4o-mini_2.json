It appropriately mentions the giving of the Law to the Israelites by God at Mount Sinai. However, to fully address the concern of connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ, the response could have further emphasized how the Festival of Weeks foreshadowed Pentecost in Christian tradition, where the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles. Adding more explicit references to the connection between the Jewish festival and its Christian fulfillment would strengthen the response in relation to the concern provided."
