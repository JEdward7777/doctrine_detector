The term "Christians" is first recorded in the New Testament in the book of Acts in the Bible.

This likely occurred in the first century AD, shortly after the death and resurrection of Jesus.

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the location of the first recorded use of the term "Christians" as Antioch and the approximate timeframe. It also references the relevant biblical passage in Acts. However, the response lacks additional elaboration or historical context, which would elevate the grade further.
