Comment: The response accurately states that Jesus' followers were first called "Christians" in Antioch, which shows a good understanding of the historical context of the term's origin. However, it would be even stronger if the response explicitly mentioned the significance of this event, such as how it marked the emergence of Christianity as a distinct entity or the implications for early Christian communities. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the basic facts and provides a clear and concise summary of the information.
