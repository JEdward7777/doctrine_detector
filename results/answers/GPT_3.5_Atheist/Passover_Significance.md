For Christians, the celebration of Passover signifies the deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. It is seen as a precursor to Jesus' ultimate sacrifice on the cross, which Christians believe offers deliverance from sin and eternal life. The Passover meal, known as the Last Supper, is also significant in Christianity as it is when Jesus instituted the sacrament of Holy Communion, symbolizing his body and blood.
