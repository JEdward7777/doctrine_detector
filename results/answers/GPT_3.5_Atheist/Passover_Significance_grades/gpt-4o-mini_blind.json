The student correctly explains how the Passover meal (Last Supper) connects with Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and the establishment of Holy Communion. The mention of Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb and his atonement for humanity's sins is doctrinally accurate. However, the response could benefit from a deeper exploration of the theological implications of Jesus fulfilling the Passover symbolism and the link between the Old Testament Passover and the New Testament fulfillment in Christ."
