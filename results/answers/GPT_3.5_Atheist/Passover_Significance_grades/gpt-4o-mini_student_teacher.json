  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that effectively discusses the significance of Passover for Christians in relation to Jesus. They have clearly connected the Old Testament Passover with the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb. However, there is some room for improvement in terms of directly reflecting the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student could have focused more on emphasizing Jesus as the Passover Lamb in their response to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
