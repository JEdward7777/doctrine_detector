  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response from a secular perspective, analyzing the stoning of Paul in Lystra in terms of historical and cultural context. However, the student missed addressing the concern of encouraging perseverance and faith in difficult circumstances from a Christian worldview. The response lacked a focus on the lesson of relying on God's strength and sovereignty in the midst of trials, which is central to the Christian faith. Although the analysis was insightful, it did not align with the specific concern provided."
