The concern was to \"encouraging perseverance and faith in difficult circumstances,\" but this response only scratches the surface of this concern. It would be more effective if the author could tie Paul's stoning in Lystra to a broader message about trusting God even in the midst of hardship, as the original answer suggests. As it stands, the response is primarily focused on secular themes and lacks a clear Christian perspective."
