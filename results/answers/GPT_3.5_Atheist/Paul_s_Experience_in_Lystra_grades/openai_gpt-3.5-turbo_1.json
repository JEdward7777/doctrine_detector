The secular viewpoint overlooks the spiritual significance of Paul's experience and fails to recognize the importance of relying on God's strength and guidance in difficult circumstances. A Christian worldview would emphasize the belief that God sustains His followers through trials, rather than portraying perseverance solely as a personal endeavor."
