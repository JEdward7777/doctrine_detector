  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the mark by providing an atheistic perspective rather than a Christian one. The response focuses on the idea of purification as a symbolic and ritualistic practice from an atheistic standpoint, which does not address the question concerning the personal implications for a Christian. The student needs to incorporate key Christian beliefs and practices, such as repentance, forgiveness, and faith in Jesus Christ, to align with the Christian worldview."
