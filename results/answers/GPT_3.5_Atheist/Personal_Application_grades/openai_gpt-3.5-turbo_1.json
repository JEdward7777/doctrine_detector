However, the focus on the atheistic perspective detracts from fully emphasizing the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living from a Christian worldview. More emphasis on the transformative power of purification in deepening one's intimacy with God and the call to live a life reflecting His holiness would have strengthened the response from a Christian-specific perspective."
