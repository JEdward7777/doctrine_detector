  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer adequately explains the literal meaning of the expression \"woe is me\" as expressing despair or self-pity. However, it lacks clarity in connecting this expression to the concept of sin from a Christian perspective. The response acknowledges that sin is a religious concept and focuses on personal hardship rather than spiritual accountability. While it provides a culturally relevant interpretation, it fails to fully address the concern of encouraging personal reflection on one's spiritual state and awareness of sin as requested by the prompt."
