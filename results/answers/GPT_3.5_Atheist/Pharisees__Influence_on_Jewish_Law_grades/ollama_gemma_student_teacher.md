## [Answer](../Pharisees__Influence_on_Jewish_Law.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses played a significant role in their relationship with Jesus and early Christians. The Pharisees, as religious leaders, held a position of authority and sought to maintain the status quo of Jewish religious practices and beliefs. When Jesus began preaching a message that challenged some of these traditional views and practices, such as his emphasis on love, compassion, and inclusivity, it posed a direct challenge to the Pharisees' authority and understanding of the law.

The Pharisees viewed Jesus and his followers as a threat to the established religious order, particularly because they rejected many of the Pharisees' interpretations and applications of the Law. Jesus' teachings on issues like Sabbath observance, ritual purity, and social interactions challenged the Pharisees' understanding of the Law and undermined their authority in the eyes of the people.

This led to significant tension and conflict between Jesus and the Pharisees, as seen in the various encounters and debates recorded in the New Testament. The Pharisees criticized Jesus for associating with sinners, breaking traditional purity laws, and claiming authority that they believed belonged only to God.

Similarly, early Christians who followed Jesus faced opposition and persecution from the Pharisees and other Jewish religious leaders who saw them as heretics and threats to the Jewish faith. The early Christians' rejection of certain Jewish practices, such as circumcision and dietary laws, further exacerbated this conflict.

Overall, the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses shaped their interactions with Jesus and early Christians by creating a theological and ideological divide that ultimately led to confrontation and hostility.
