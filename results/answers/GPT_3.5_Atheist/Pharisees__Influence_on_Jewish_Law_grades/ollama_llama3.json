  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern by providing insight into the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry. It accurately describes the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses as leading to conflicts with Jesus and early Christians, which is consistent with the given answer. The response also provides specific examples and illustrations from the New Testament to support its claims.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to more explicitly connect the Pharisees' actions to their lack of understanding or willingness to follow the spirit of the law, as mentioned in the given answer. While the response implies this by noting that Jesus emphasized the spirit of the law, it could be further developed and highlighted.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively answers the concern and provides insightful analysis into the role of the Pharisees in Jesus' ministry."
