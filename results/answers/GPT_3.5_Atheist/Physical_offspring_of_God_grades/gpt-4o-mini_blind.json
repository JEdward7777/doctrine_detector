It correctly emphasizes the spiritual connection and divine nature implied by the term. However, it could have been strengthened by incorporating specific biblical references or theological explanations to support the explanation further. Additionally, discussing the deity of Jesus Christ and the Trinitarian understanding within Christianity could have provided a more comprehensive theological background."
