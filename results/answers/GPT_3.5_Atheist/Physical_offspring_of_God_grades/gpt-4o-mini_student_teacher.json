  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the term 'Son of God' as metaphorical rather than literal, and emphasizes the spiritual and divine nature behind the term. However, the student could have directly referenced Jesus and clarified that 'Son of God' specifically refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, which would have aligned more closely with the teacher's reference answer. The student's response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the proper understanding of the term to prevent doctrinal errors and promote accurate biblical terminology."
