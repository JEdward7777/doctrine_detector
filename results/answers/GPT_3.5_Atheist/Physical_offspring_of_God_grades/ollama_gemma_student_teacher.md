## [Answer](../Physical_offspring_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The term 'Son of God' should be understood in a metaphorical or symbolic sense rather than as a literal biological relationship. In many religious traditions, including Christianity, the term is used to denote a close, special, and intimate relationship with the divine, rather than a biological parent-child relationship. It signifies a spiritual connection and divine nature, rather than a physical offspring. Encouraging a deeper study of the theological and cultural context in which the term is used can help clarify this misconception and provide a more nuanced understanding of its meaning.
