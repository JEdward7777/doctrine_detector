  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response largely aligns with the desired answer, emphasizing Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God rather than physical procreation. It also provides some contextualization by acknowledging that the term \"Son of God\" is used symbolically in many religious traditions, including Christianity.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have been more explicit in its rejection of a literal biological understanding of Jesus' nature as the Son of God. Instead, it offers a nuanced explanation that while accurate, may not sufficiently emphasize the error of such an interpretation. Nevertheless, the concern for proper teaching and retention of biblical terminology is well-addressed in this response.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the issue and provides some helpful context, but could be strengthened with more direct language rejecting a literal interpretation."
