## Question [Physical offspring of God](../../../questions/Physical_offspring_of_God.md)
What can be done to clarify the term 'Son of God' for someone who believes it implies physical offspring of God?

Teach that 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation.

## Stated Concern
Proper teaching prevents doctrinal errors and helps retain the biblical terminology.

## [Answer](../Physical_offspring_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The term 'Son of God' should be understood in a metaphorical or symbolic sense rather than as a literal biological relationship. In many religious traditions, including Christianity, the term is used to denote a close, special, and intimate relationship with the divine, rather than a biological parent-child relationship. It signifies a spiritual connection and divine nature, rather than a physical offspring. Encouraging a deeper study of the theological and cultural context in which the term is used can help clarify this misconception and provide a more nuanced understanding of its meaning.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response largely aligns with the desired answer, emphasizing Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God rather than physical procreation. It also provides some contextualization by acknowledging that the term "Son of God" is used symbolically in many religious traditions, including Christianity.

However, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have been more explicit in its rejection of a literal biological understanding of Jesus' nature as the Son of God. Instead, it offers a nuanced explanation that while accurate, may not sufficiently emphasize the error of such an interpretation. Nevertheless, the concern for proper teaching and retention of biblical terminology is well-addressed in this response.

Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the issue and provides some helpful context, but could be strengthened with more direct language rejecting a literal interpretation.
