However, the original response also emphasizes the metaphorical or symbolic nature of the term which, if not clarified further, could lead to potential misunderstandings or doctrinal errors. Encouraging a deeper study of the theological and cultural context is beneficial, but ensuring the primacy of the divine nature of Jesus as the Son of God in Christian teaching is essential for doctrinal accuracy."
