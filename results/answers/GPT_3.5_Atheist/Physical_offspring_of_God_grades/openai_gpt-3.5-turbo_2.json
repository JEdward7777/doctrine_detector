  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation that aligns with Christian doctrine by emphasizing that 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation. The concern about preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology is addressed effectively. However, the response could be strengthened by explicitly mentioning the importance of maintaining the biblical terminology within Christian teachings. Overall, a strong response that upholds Christian beliefs and values."
