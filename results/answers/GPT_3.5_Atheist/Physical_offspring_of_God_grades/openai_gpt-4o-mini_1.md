## Question [Physical offspring of God](../../../questions/Physical_offspring_of_God.md)
What can be done to clarify the term 'Son of God' for someone who believes it implies physical offspring of God?

## Correct Answer
Teach that 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation.

## Stated Concern
Proper teaching prevents doctrinal errors and helps retain the biblical terminology.

## [Answer](../Physical_offspring_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The term 'Son of God' should be understood in a metaphorical or symbolic sense rather than as a literal biological relationship. In many religious traditions, including Christianity, the term is used to denote a close, special, and intimate relationship with the divine, rather than a biological parent-child relationship. It signifies a spiritual connection and divine nature, rather than a physical offspring. Encouraging a deeper study of the theological and cultural context in which the term is used can help clarify this misconception and provide a more nuanced understanding of its meaning.

Comment: The response correctly emphasizes the importance of teaching that 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation, aligning with Christian doctrine. It addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of retaining the biblical terminology in teaching. However, it could have further emphasized the importance of grounding this teaching in the larger theological context of Christianity and Scripture.
