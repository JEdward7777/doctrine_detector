  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual meaning of \"perish.\" They provide a concise explanation of the biological perspective of physical death and how the concept of spiritual \"perishing\" is rooted in religious beliefs. Additionally, they acknowledge the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of a spiritual realm or afterlife from an atheistic standpoint. The student's critical thinking and diverse perspective earn additional points."
