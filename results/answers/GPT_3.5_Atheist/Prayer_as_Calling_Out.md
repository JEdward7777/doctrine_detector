The phrase "call out to the Lord" can be interpreted as a symbolic act in which believers express their feelings, desires, and needs to a higher power. From an atheistic perspective, one could view this phrase as a way for individuals to find solace, hope, and comfort in times of need by directing their thoughts inwardly or outwardly towards a concept of the divine. It can also be seen as a way to provide oneself with motivation, clarity, or simply a sense of connection to something greater than oneself.
