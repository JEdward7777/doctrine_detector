  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer does not address the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life, as requested in the concern. The answer focuses more on subjective interpretations and perspectives rather than providing a Christian-specific understanding. The student should have emphasized the aspect of seeking God's help, trust, and dependence in prayer to align with the given reference answer."
