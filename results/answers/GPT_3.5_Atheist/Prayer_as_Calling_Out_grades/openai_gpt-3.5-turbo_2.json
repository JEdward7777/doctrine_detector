  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response does not align with the Christian perspective provided in the answer key. From a Christian worldview, \"calling out to the Lord\" goes beyond a symbolic act or seeking solace in times of need; it reflects a deep relationship of dependence on God in all aspects of life. The perspective presented in the response lacks the recognition of the importance of prayer and reliance on God, which are foundational principles in Christian daily living. Improvement is needed to more accurately reflect a Christian understanding of the concept."
