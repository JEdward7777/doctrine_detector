  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a decent explanation of the concept of predestination in Christianity, they miss the crucial aspect of predestination being specifically tied to salvation, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student correctly mentions the Calvinist view of predestination but falls short in clearly connecting predestination to the predetermined destiny of individuals regarding eternal life. A stronger emphasis on the relationship between predestination and salvation would have improved their answer significantly."
