  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of the privileges that adopted children of God receive as mentioned in Romans 8:14-15. The explanation is doctrinally sound and effectively conveys the assurance, inheritance, and comfort that believers have as children of God. The student could strengthen the answer further by elaborating on the concept of being led by the Spirit of God and its significance in the adoption process. Overall, a well-written response aligning with a Christian worldview."
