## [Answer](../Privileges_of_Sonship.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Romans 8:14-15, the apostle Paul states that those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God and have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom they can cry out, "Abba, Father." This concept of adoption as children of God carries with it certain privileges for believers in Christianity.

One privilege that adopted children of God receive is the assurance of their relationship with God. By being adopted into God's family, believers are assured of their status as His children and have the right to approach Him as a loving Father. This sense of belonging and security in God's family is a privilege that brings comfort and peace to believers.

Another privilege is the inheritance that comes with being children of God. Believers are considered co-heirs with Christ, meaning they share in his inheritance of eternal life and blessings. This inheritance includes the promise of salvation, the hope of resurrection, and the assurance of being with God for eternity.

Overall, the privileges of being adopted children of God include a secure relationship with Him, the assurance of salvation, and the hope of an eternal inheritance. These privileges bring comfort, reassurance, and hope to believers as they navigate their faith journey.
