However, the inclusion of an atheistic perspective and lack of focus on the specific biblical context of the Promised Land detracts from the accurate biblical significance required in the explanation. The response would benefit from a more concentrated exploration of the Abrahamic covenant and its theological implications within a Christian worldview."
