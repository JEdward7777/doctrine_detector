However, the response veers off track by introducing an atheistic perspective that emphasizes the Promised Land as a symbolic representation of aspirations and hopes, which moves away from the specific concern of understanding the biblical significance of God's promises. The acknowledgment of the importance of religious narratives and traditions is valid, but the Atheistic perspective introduced detracts from the primary focus on the Christian perspective."
