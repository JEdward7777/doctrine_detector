## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I approach this question from a secular perspective rather than a religious one. The idea of discerning one's "calling" or "purpose" is not exclusively tied to religious beliefs; it can also be viewed in a more humanistic and introspective way.

In secular terms, finding one's purpose or calling can involve self-reflection, exploring personal interests and strengths, setting meaningful goals, and aligning one's actions with values that are important to them. Rather than relying on a divine plan or external guidance, individuals can actively engage with the world around them, seek out opportunities for growth and fulfillment, and make choices that resonate with their intrinsic desires and values.

Ultimately, discovering one's purpose is a personal journey that may involve trial and error, learning from experiences, and adapting as circumstances change. It is a process of self-discovery and self-actualization that can lead to a sense of direction, fulfillment, and meaning in one's life, regardless of religious beliefs.
