  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer completely dismisses the Christian perspective in discerning one's calling or purpose as described in the Bible. As a Christian, the foundation for understanding one's purpose is rooted in God's plan and design for each individual. The student's secular approach overlooks the importance of seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit and aligning one's calling with God's will. While secular perspectives on self-reflection and personal growth can complement a Christian worldview, this response does not adequately address the concern of finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life."
