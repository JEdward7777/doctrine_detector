However, from a Christian perspective, the key aspect of seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, prayer, and studying Scripture to discern one's calling is missing. While self-reflection and personal exploration are important, the absence of religious guidance in the context of fulfilling God's purpose limits the depth and completeness of the response. Incorporating the importance of seeking divine guidance would address the concern more fully."
