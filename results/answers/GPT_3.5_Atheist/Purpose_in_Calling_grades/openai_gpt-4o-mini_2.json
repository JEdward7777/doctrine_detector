However, from a Christian worldview concerned with fulfilling God's purpose in life, the response falls short. It neglects the importance of seeking guidance from God through prayer, Scripture, and the Holy Spirit, which are foundational elements in discerning one's calling. It offers valuable insights on a humanistic approach to purpose, but lacks the crucial spiritual dimension necessary for Christians to find clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose."
