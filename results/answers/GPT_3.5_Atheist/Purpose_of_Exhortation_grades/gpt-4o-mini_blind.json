However, it falls short in accurately reflecting a Christian worldview. The answer is provided from a secular perspective, lacking an understanding of the deeper spiritual significance of exhortation in Christianity. A more substantial explanation rooted in the teachings of the New Testament and the purpose of exhortation in guiding believers towards God's will would have improved the response."
