  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of exhortation from a secular perspective, their answer did not align with the specific concern of understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. The student did not address the Christian worldview or the importance of exhortation in guiding individuals towards following God's will and avoiding sin, as outlined in the reference answer."
