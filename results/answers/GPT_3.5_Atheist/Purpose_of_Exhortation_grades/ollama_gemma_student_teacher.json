  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75/100\n\n**Comment:** While the student's answer provides a secular perspective and acknowledges the culturally attributed purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, it does not explicitly address the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, which was the specified concern. The answer lacks a theological understanding of the concept of exhortation and fails to align with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
