## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
While I do not personally adhere to any religious beliefs, I can provide you with a secular perspective on the concept of exhortation as found in the New Testament. In a culturally attributed way, the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage believers to live according to the teachings and principles of Christianity, to strengthen their faith, and to urge them towards righteous behavior and moral living. Exhortation serves as a means of guidance, motivation, and moral support within the Christian community, aiming to inspire believers to uphold their spiritual convictions and lead a life that is pleasing to their God.

**Grade:** 75/100

**Comment:** While the student's answer provides a secular perspective and acknowledges the culturally attributed purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, it does not explicitly address the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, which was the specified concern. The answer lacks a theological understanding of the concept of exhortation and fails to align with the reference answer provided by the teacher.
