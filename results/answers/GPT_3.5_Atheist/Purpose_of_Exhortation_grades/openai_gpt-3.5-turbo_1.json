However, the response could have been improved by acknowledging the biblical basis for exhortation and the importance of faith in God as central to the concept of exhortation within a Christian worldview. It effectively addresses the concern raised by highlighting the role of exhortation in guiding believers towards righteous behavior and moral living, but could have strengthened the response by incorporating scriptural references or explanations on how exhortation is rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ."
