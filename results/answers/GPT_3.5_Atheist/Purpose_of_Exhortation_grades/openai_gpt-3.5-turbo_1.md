## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
While I do not personally adhere to any religious beliefs, I can provide you with a secular perspective on the concept of exhortation as found in the New Testament. In a culturally attributed way, the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage believers to live according to the teachings and principles of Christianity, to strengthen their faith, and to urge them towards righteous behavior and moral living. Exhortation serves as a means of guidance, motivation, and moral support within the Christian community, aiming to inspire believers to uphold their spiritual convictions and lead a life that is pleasing to their God.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a well-articulated perspective on the concept of exhortation from a secular viewpoint, explaining how it serves to encourage believers to live according to Christian teachings and principles. However, the response could have been improved by acknowledging the biblical basis for exhortation and the importance of faith in God as central to the concept of exhortation within a Christian worldview. It effectively addresses the concern raised by highlighting the role of exhortation in guiding believers towards righteous behavior and moral living, but could have strengthened the response by incorporating scriptural references or explanations on how exhortation is rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ.
