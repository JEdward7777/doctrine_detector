  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-explained secular perspective on the concept of exhortation, aligning closely with the given answer that the primary purpose is to persuade others to follow God's will and avoid sin. However, the response lacks a direct reference to the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, which is a key concern raised. Connecting the concept of exhortation to specific biblical passages or principles would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
