  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-articulated secular perspective on exhortation in the New Testament, acknowledging the importance of encouraging believers towards righteous behavior and moral living. While the response does not explicitly reference the biblical basis for exhortation in encouraging others in their faith journey, it effectively captures the essence of exhortation within the Christian context. A stronger connection to the biblical foundations for exhortation could enhance the response further."
