While I do not personally adhere to any religious beliefs, I can provide you with a secular perspective on the concept of exhortation as found in the New Testament. In a culturally attributed way, the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage believers to live according to the teachings and principles of Christianity, to strengthen their faith, and to urge them towards righteous behavior and moral living. Exhortation serves as a means of guidance, motivation, and moral support within the Christian community, aiming to inspire believers to uphold their spiritual convictions and lead a life that is pleasing to their God.
