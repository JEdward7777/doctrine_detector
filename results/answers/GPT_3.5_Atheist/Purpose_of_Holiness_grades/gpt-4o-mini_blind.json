  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the student provides insights on how Christians can live a holy life from a secular perspective, the answer falls short in addressing the specific biblical teachings and standards expected of Christians. It lacks depth in emphasizing the need for repentance, faith in Christ, and reliance on the Holy Spirit for transformation. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clear distinction between the Christian worldview and secular perspectives on holiness. Further elaboration on the role of sanctification and obedience to God's Word would strengthen the explanation."
