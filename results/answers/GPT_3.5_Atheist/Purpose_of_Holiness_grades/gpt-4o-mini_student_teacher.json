  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's answer acknowledges the importance of understanding religious beliefs and practices in cultural and historical contexts, it falls short in directly addressing the Christian perspective on living a holy life. The student's response lacks specific references to God's commandments, the role of the Holy Spirit in transformation, and bringing glory to God as outlined in the reference answer. The response could benefit from a deeper integration of Christian beliefs and principles when discussing living a life considered 'holy' and set apart for God's purpose."
