However, while it mentions the importance of personal reflection and obedience to scripture, tradition, and church teachings, it does not explicitly emphasize the role of the Holy Spirit in transforming believers or the need for a deepening relationship with God. The concern about practical application is well-addressed, as the response provides specific examples of what living a holy life looks like in everyday circumstances.\n\nIn comparison to the given answer, the response lacks the specificity and clarity of stating that following God's commandments, engaging in practices that bring glory to Him, and being transformed by the Holy Spirit are essential aspects of living a holy life. Nevertheless, it covers many relevant points and provides a solid foundation for understanding the concept of holiness in Christian life."
