  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how Christians are called to live holy lives by following God's commandments, engaging in practices that bring glory to Him, and being transformed by the Holy Spirit. It effectively addresses the concern regarding the practical application of holiness in a believer's life from a Christian perspective. The reference to scripture, tradition, and church teachings adds depth to the explanation. A slightly higher grade could be achieved by explicitly mentioning the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the foundation for living a holy life."
