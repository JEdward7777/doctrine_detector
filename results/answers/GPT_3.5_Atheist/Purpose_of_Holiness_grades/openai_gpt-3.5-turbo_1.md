## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I approach this question from a secular perspective, acknowledging the importance of understanding religious beliefs and practices in the context of cultural and historical retribution. 

For Christians, living a life that is considered 'holy' and set apart for God's purpose involves following the teachings and example of Jesus Christ. This includes practicing virtues such as love, compassion, forgiveness, and humility, and living in accordance with the moral and ethical principles outlined in the Bible.

To live a holy life, Christians are expected to engage in prayer, worship, and regular reflection on their beliefs and actions. They are called to treat others with kindness and respect, to seek justice and promote peace, and to live in a way that reflects their faith in God.

Ultimately, the pursuit of holiness is a personal and ongoing journey for Christians, guided by their understanding of scripture, tradition, and the teachings of their church. It is a way of living that brings them closer to God and helps them fulfill their purpose as followers of Christ.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how Christians are called to live holy lives by following God's commandments, engaging in practices that bring glory to Him, and being transformed by the Holy Spirit. It effectively addresses the concern regarding the practical application of holiness in a believer's life from a Christian perspective. The reference to scripture, tradition, and church teachings adds depth to the explanation.
