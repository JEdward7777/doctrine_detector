Although the answer incorporated elements of Christian beliefs and practices, it primarily focused on describing what it means to live a holy life without delving deeper into the practical application. More emphasis could have been placed on how Christians specifically apply God's commandments, practices, and transformation by the Holy Spirit in their daily lives to demonstrate holiness."
