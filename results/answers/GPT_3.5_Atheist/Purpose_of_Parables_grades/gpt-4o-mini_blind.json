However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the spiritual significance of parables in conveying deeper truths about the kingdom of God and the nature of discipleship. In a Christian worldview, the primary purpose of Jesus using parables goes beyond conveying moral lessons and challenging the religious authorities; it also serves to reveal truths about God's kingdom and to provoke spiritual transformation in the hearts of his listeners. The student could improve by highlighting the redemptive and transformative aspects of Jesus' parables in shaping the understanding and behavior of his followers."
