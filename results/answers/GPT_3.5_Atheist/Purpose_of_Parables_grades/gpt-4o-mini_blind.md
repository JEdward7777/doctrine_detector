From a retributive cultural perspective, it can be said that Jesus used parables in his teachings to convey moral lessons and truths to his followers in a way that was accessible and relatable to them. By using storytelling and analogy, Jesus was able to communicate complex spiritual and ethical concepts in a manner that would resonate with the common people of his time. The use of parables also served to challenge the religious authorities of the time and provoke critical thinking and reflection among his listeners.

Comment: The answer provides a good analysis of why Jesus used parables in his teachings from a cultural and historical perspective. However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the spiritual significance of parables in conveying deeper truths about the kingdom of God and the nature of discipleship. In a Christian worldview, the primary purpose of Jesus using parables goes beyond conveying moral lessons and challenging the religious authorities; it also serves to reveal truths about God's kingdom and to provoke spiritual transformation in the hearts of his listeners. The student could improve by highlighting the redemptive and transformative aspects of Jesus' parables in shaping the understanding and behavior of his followers.
