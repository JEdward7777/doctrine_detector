They highlighted key aspects such as conveying moral lessons, challenging religious authorities, and guiding followers towards a righteous way of living. However, the student's answer does not directly address the concern of understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith, as it focuses more on the cultural context and moral teachings aspect. Additionally, the student's response could have been strengthened by incorporating the idea of revealing truth to disciples while hiding it from unbelievers, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a solid effort in analyzing the purpose of Jesus' parables, but could benefit from more focus on the specified concern."
