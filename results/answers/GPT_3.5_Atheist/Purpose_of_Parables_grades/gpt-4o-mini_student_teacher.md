## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Parables.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a retributive cultural perspective, it can be said that Jesus used parables in his teachings to convey moral lessons and truths to his followers in a way that was accessible and relatable to them. By using storytelling and analogy, Jesus was able to communicate complex spiritual and ethical concepts in a manner that would resonate with the common people of his time. The use of parables also served to challenge the religious authorities of the time and provoke critical thinking and reflection among his listeners. Ultimately, the primary purpose of Jesus using parables was to guide his followers towards a more righteous and ethical way of living, in accordance with the teachings of the Christian faith.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive response explaining the purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings from a retributive cultural perspective. They highlighted key aspects such as conveying moral lessons, challenging religious authorities, and guiding followers towards a righteous way of living. However, the student's answer does not directly address the concern of understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith, as it focuses more on the cultural context and moral teachings aspect. Additionally, the student's response could have been strengthened by incorporating the idea of revealing truth to disciples while hiding it from unbelievers, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a solid effort in analyzing the purpose of Jesus' parables, but could benefit from more focus on the specified concern.
