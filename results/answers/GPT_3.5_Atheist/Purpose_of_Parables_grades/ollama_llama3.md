## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Parables.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a retributive cultural perspective, it can be said that Jesus used parables in his teachings to convey moral lessons and truths to his followers in a way that was accessible and relatable to them. By using storytelling and analogy, Jesus was able to communicate complex spiritual and ethical concepts in a manner that would resonate with the common people of his time. The use of parables also served to challenge the religious authorities of the time and provoke critical thinking and reflection among his listeners. Ultimately, the primary purpose of Jesus using parables was to guide his followers towards a more righteous and ethical way of living, in accordance with the teachings of the Christian faith.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides some insight into Jesus' use of parables, acknowledging their purpose in conveying moral lessons and truths to his followers. However, it falls short in fully grasping the depth and significance of Jesus' teaching methods, particularly with regards to the concern of understanding the implications for faith.

The response largely focuses on the retributive cultural perspective, highlighting the accessibility and relatability of parables, without delving deeper into the ways in which Jesus' use of parables revealed truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe. This omission reduces the scope and nuance of the discussion, making it less effective in exploring the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith.

To improve this response, the writer could explore more thoroughly the ways in which Jesus' use of parables was intentional and specific to his message, revealing truth to those who were seeking it while concealing it from those who were not. By doing so, the writer would be better equipped to demonstrate a deeper understanding of Jesus' teaching methods and their significance for faith.
