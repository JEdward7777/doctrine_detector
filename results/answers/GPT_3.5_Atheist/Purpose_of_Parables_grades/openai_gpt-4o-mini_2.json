The inclusion of how parables differentiated between believers and non-believers aligns well with biblical teachings on Jesus' use of parables to reveal truth to those who were receptive. The response successfully addresses the concern and demonstrates a solid understanding of the teaching methods of Jesus and their significance for faith. Well done!"
