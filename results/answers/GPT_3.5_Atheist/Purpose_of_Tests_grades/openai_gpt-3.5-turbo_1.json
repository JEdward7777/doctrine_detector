  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The atheistic scholar's response fails to acknowledge the Christian belief in a higher power orchestrating tests for believers. From a Christian perspective, the purpose of tests is not solely to strengthen faith or promote personal growth, but to ultimately draw individuals closer to God by exposing sin and prompting repentance. This response does not align with Christian teachings on the nature and purpose of tests, and therefore, receives a low grade."
