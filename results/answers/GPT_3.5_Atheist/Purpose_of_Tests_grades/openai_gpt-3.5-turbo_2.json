However, from a Christian worldview, the purpose of tests goes beyond strengthening faith and fostering resilience; it also involves revealing sin, prompting repentance, and drawing believers closer to God. While the sociological perspective presented is thoughtful, it falls short of acknowledging the spiritual significance of tests in a believer's life."
