However, from a Christian worldview, the purpose of tests is not solely to strengthen faith or promote growth as individuals, but also to expose sin, prompt repentance, and draw believers closer to God. While the response acknowledges some benefits of tests, it falls short in addressing the foundational purpose of tests from a Christian standpoint, which is crucial in understanding believers' response to difficult circumstances."
