  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the concept of the soul and its implications on a person's relationship with God. However, the response spends more time discussing atheistic perspectives and the general influence of beliefs about the soul, rather than focusing directly on how the soul specifically relates to a person's relationship with God as described in scripture. To improve, the student should include more specific references to scriptural passages and teachings that highlight the significance of the soul in one's relationship with God."
