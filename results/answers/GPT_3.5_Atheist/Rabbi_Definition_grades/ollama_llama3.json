  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the term \"Rabbi\" as referring to a spiritual leader or teacher in the Jewish tradition, which addresses the concern of understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. Additionally, it provides specific examples from the New Testament of Jesus being addressed as \"Rabbi\", highlighting his role as a revered teacher and leader.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the literal meaning of the term \"Rabbi\" provided in the answer, which is \"my master\" or \"my teacher\". This omission reduces the grade. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament and its relevance to Jesus' role as a spiritual leader.\n\nComment: The response could be improved by directly addressing the literal meaning of the term \"Rabbi\" and providing more explicit connections between rabbinic teaching and the New Testament."
