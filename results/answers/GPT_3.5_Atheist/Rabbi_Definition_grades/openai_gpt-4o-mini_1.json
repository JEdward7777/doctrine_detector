  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"Rabbi\" and its meaning as \"my master\" or \"my teacher\" in the Jewish tradition. It effectively acknowledges the role of a Rabbi as a religious teacher who imparts knowledge of God's laws. The connection between the term \"Rabbi\" and Jesus in the New Testament is also briefly addressed. To improve the grade, a deeper exploration of how rabbinic teaching influenced Jesus' role as a teacher and leader in the Christian faith could have been included."
