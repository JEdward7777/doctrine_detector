## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
It is believed that the apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper, also known as the Eucharist or Communion, as a regular practice for believers for several reasons. From a cultural perspective, the Lord's Supper served as a way to commemorate and remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who Christians believed died on the cross for their sins.

Paul likely saw the ritual of the Lord's Supper as a way to unify and strengthen the early Christian community. Sharing a communal meal would have fostered a sense of camaraderie and solidarity among believers, helping to establish a shared identity and belief system.

Additionally, the act of sharing bread and wine symbolized the body and blood of Christ, reminding believers of the central tenets of their faith and reinforcing their commitment to following Jesus' teachings.

Overall, the establishment of the Lord's Supper as a regular practice by Paul likely served both a symbolic and practical purpose in reinforcing the beliefs and community of early Christians.
