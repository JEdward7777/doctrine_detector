However, it falls short on emphasizing the deeper spiritual significance of the sacrament. The student should have highlighted the theological importance of the Lord's Supper as a means of grace, representing the atoning sacrifice of Christ on the cross and the ongoing communion with Him. Adding these aspects would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
