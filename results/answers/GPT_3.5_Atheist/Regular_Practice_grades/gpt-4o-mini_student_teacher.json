  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provides some insights into the reasons behind the establishment of the Lord's Supper, such as cultural commemoration, community building, and symbolic significance, the answer lacks a clear focus on the central aspect emphasized in the reference answer - that is, to remember and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The student's explanation could have been strengthened by incorporating scriptural references or theological perspectives that highlight the specific Christian beliefs surrounding the Lord's Supper. Additionally, there is a need for a more explicit connection to the concern provided, which emphasizes the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. The response could benefit from a deeper engagement with the core Christian teachings and the significance of the Lord's Supper in nourishing and expressing faith."
