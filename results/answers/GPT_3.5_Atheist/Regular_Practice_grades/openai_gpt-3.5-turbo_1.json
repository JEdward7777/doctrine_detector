It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the role of the Lord's Supper in remembering and proclaiming the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, thereby recognizing its importance in the life of the church and individual believers. The integration of a Christian worldview in explaining the reasons behind the establishment of the Lord's Supper is clear and well-supported."
