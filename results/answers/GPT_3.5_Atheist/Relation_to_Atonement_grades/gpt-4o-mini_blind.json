In a Christian worldview, propitiation specifically refers to the act of satisfying God's wrath through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, whereas atonement refers to the broader concept of reconciliation and restoration of relationship with God. The answer correctly touches on the idea of appeasing divine justice and seeking reconciliation with the divine, but it could benefit from more clarity and depth in explaining how these terms are specifically understood and applied within Christian theology."
