  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the terms 'propitiation' and 'atonement' in a culturally retributive context, highlighting their significance in religious traditions. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the specific relationship between the two terms and emphasizing the key distinction that propitiation specifically involves appeasing God's wrath. It would be beneficial for the student to further clarify the differences and similarities between propitiation and atonement in the context of Christian theology."
