# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The term 'propitiation' and the term 'atonement' both relate to the concept of satisfying divine justice or reconciling humanity with the divine in various religious traditions. 

In a culturally retributive context, 'propitiation' typically refers to the act of appeasing or pleasing a deity or deities through rituals, prayers, or sacrifices, in order to avert divine anger or punishment. This concept is often found in religions where there is a belief in the need to placate or pacify a powerful and sometimes wrathful god to avoid negative consequences.

On the other hand, 'atonement' is a broader term that encompasses the idea of making amends or ameliorating the effects of wrongdoing or sin. In religious contexts, atonement often involves seeking reconciliation with the divine, seeking forgiveness for transgressions, and restoring a harmonious relationship with the divine or one's community.

In summary, while 'propitiation' specifically focuses on the act of appeasing a deity, 'atonement' encompasses a wider range of meaning, including seeking reconciliation, making amends, and restoring harmony in a culturally retributive context.
