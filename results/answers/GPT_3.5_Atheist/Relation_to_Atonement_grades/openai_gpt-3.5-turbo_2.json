  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the differences and similarities between propitiation and atonement, in line with a Christian worldview. It correctly emphasizes the idea that propitiation focuses on appeasing God's wrath specifically, while atonement encompasses a broader concept of reconciliation and making amends. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting key theological distinctions between these terms."
