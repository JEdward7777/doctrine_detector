  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God as depicted in the Bible. The references to the Old Testament (such as the example of Nineveh in the Book of Jonah) and the New Testament (like the teachings of Jesus and Paul) support the discussion well. The answer accurately conveys the importance of repentance in averting God's wrath and emphasizes the biblical mandate for turning away from sin. Overall, a doctrinally sound explanation that could benefit from a bit more depth and additional scriptural references for a higher grade."
