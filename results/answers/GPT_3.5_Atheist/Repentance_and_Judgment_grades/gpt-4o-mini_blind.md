## [Answer](../Repentance_and_Judgment.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Bible does indeed discuss the relationship between repentance and the concept of God's wrath in various passages. In the Old Testament, for example, we see instances where repentance is often linked to the idea of averting divine anger or punishment. In the Book of Jonah, for instance, the people of Nineveh repent of their wicked ways, prompting God to relent from the destruction he had planned to bring upon them.

Similarly, in the New Testament, we see teachings from Jesus and the apostles emphasizing the importance of repentance in order to escape the coming judgment. The Apostle Paul, for example, warns in Romans 2:5 that those who persist in unrepentant behavior are storing up wrath for themselves on the day of judgment.

Overall, the Bible presents repentance as a crucial component in avoiding the wrath of God, with the idea being that turning away from sin and seeking forgiveness can lead to reconciliation with God and the avoidance of divine judgment.
