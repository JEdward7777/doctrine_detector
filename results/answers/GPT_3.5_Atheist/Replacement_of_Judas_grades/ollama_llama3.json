  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately recounts the events surrounding Matthias' selection as one of the twelve apostles, including Judas Iscariot's betrayal and subsequent death. It also correctly references the Acts of the Apostles, which is the primary source for understanding this event in Christian tradition.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by more explicitly highlighting the significance of Matthias' selection for recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While the response touches on this concern indirectly by mentioning Matthias as one of the twelve apostles, a more direct connection between his selection and the broader theme of maintaining apostolic succession would elevate the response to a higher grade.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account surrounding Matthias' selection, but could be improved by more explicitly linking this event to the larger issue of ensuring continuity in apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension."
