  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death, which aligns with the Christian belief in the need for apostolic succession and continuity of leadership within the early Church. The response directly addresses the concern by acknowledging the transition of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. However, to improve the grade, the response could have elaborated more on the significance of apostolic succession in maintaining the leadership structure established by Jesus for the spreading of the Gospel."
