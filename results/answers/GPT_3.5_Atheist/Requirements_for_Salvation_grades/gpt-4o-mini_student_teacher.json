However, there is some dilution in the response by suggesting that living a life in accordance with Jesus' teachings is also a way to demonstrate faith and commitment to salvation. The foundational belief for salvation in Christianity according to the Bible is repentance of sins and belief in Jesus, as mentioned in the reference answer."
