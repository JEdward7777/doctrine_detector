  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85/100\n\nComment: The response effectively captures Peter's address to the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion of Jesus by highlighting their culpability and rejection of the Messiah. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning Peter's call for repentance and the offer of forgiveness through faith in Christ. Additionally, a more direct reference to the biblical passage (Acts 3:13-15) would have further solidified the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
