Peter pointedly states that the crowd collectively crucified Jesus but emphasizes that God raised Him to life, stressing the need for repentance and faith.

## Stated Concern
Evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel.

## [Answer](../Response_to_the_Crucifixion.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Peter, as portrayed in the Bible, addressed the crowd in a culturally retributive way by placing the blame for the crucifixion of Jesus squarely on their shoulders. In the Book of Acts, Peter accuses the crowd of denying the Holy and Righteous One and asking for a murderer to be released instead. He points out their culpability in condemning Jesus to death, emphasizing their betrayal and rejection of the Messiah. This narrative serves to highlight the collective guilt of the crowd and to justify the divine judgment that followed.

**Comment:**

The student's answer adequately addresses the concern regarding the evaluation of early church preaching and the call to respond to the gospel. It correctly points out Peter's accusation of the crowd's culpability in Jesus' crucifixion and emphasizes their betrayal and rejection of the Messiah. However, the answer could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of Peter's rhetorical strategies and the broader context of the event.
