While it acknowledges different interpretations, it lacks a consistent Christian viewpoint to fully address the concern of understanding reconciliation in the Christian faith. More emphasis on the foundational aspects of God's grace, sacrifice, and redemption through Jesus Christ would strengthen the explanation from a Christian worldview."
