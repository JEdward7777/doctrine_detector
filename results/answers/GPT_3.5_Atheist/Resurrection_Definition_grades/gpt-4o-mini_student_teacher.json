  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provided a solid understanding of the term 'resurrection' in a Christian context, emphasizing Jesus Christ's resurrection as central to the faith and illustrating key theological implications. While the student touched on the cultural aspect with the mention of retribution, the focus should have been more on the spiritual significance of resurrection in Christianity. Additionally, the response could have elaborated more on the broader concept of resurrection beyond Jesus' specific resurrection. Overall, a well-explained and insightful response, but slightly lacking in depth and focus on the broader theological implications of resurrection in Christianity."
