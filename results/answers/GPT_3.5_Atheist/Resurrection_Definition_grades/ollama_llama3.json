  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response adequately addresses the fundamental concept of resurrection, accurately explaining it as the act of becoming alive again after having died. It also specifically relates Jesus' resurrection to God's power, which is in line with Christian theology. The mention of Jesus' resurrection being a central event in Christianity and its commemoration during Easter celebrations further reinforces this understanding.\n\nHowever, the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation. For instance, it does not explicitly discuss the significance of Jesus' resurrection beyond simply illustrating God's power. Additionally, while it mentions the hope of eternal life offered to believers through Jesus' resurrection, it does not delve deeper into the implications for Christian beliefs about life after death.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of resurrection and its importance in Christianity, but could be more comprehensive in its explanation."
