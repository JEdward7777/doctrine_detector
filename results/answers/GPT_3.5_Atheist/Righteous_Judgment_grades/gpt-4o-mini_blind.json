It correctly emphasizes the idea that God's love is the primary attribute and that His actions, including expressions of wrath, are understood within the context of His love. The response effectively articulates the complementary relationship between God's love, mercy, and justice. To enhance the answer, more specific references to biblical passages that illustrate the harmony between God's wrath and His love could have been included. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the role of Jesus Christ in reconciling God's wrath and love could have strengthened the argument. Overall, a solid response that covers the key points."
