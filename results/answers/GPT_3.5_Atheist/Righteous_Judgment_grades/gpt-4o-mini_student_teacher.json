  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. \n\nThe student's response effectively explains how Christians reconcile the concept of God's wrath with His nature as loving and merciful by highlighting the interconnectedness of God's attributes within the framework of justice and love. The student emphasizes that God's wrath is a reflection of His love for what is good and just, and how it ultimately leads to restoration and redemption through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. \n\nThe only slight concern is that the student's response could have been a bit more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview and offers a well-reasoned explanation."
