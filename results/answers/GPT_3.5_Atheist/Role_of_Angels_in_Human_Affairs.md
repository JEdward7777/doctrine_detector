## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Judeo-Christian tradition, angels are believed to serve God in various ways as messengers, protectors, and servants. They are often depicted as beings who carry out God's will and act as intermediaries between God and humanity. In the Bible, angels are recorded as delivering important messages to prophets and individuals, guarding and guiding believers, and praising and worshipping God in heavenly realms. They are also seen as instruments of God's judgment and justice, executing divine punishment on sinners or enemies of God.

It is important to note that these beliefs and interpretations are rooted in religious faith and may vary among different theological traditions and interpretations. From an atheistic perspective, angels are seen as mythological or metaphorical beings created by human imagination to personify various aspects of the divine. Their roles and functions are symbolic representations of human values, virtues, and experiences, rather than literal beings serving a supernatural deity.
