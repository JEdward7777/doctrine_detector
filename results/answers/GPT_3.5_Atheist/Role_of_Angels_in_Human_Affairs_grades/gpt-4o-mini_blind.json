The answer accurately highlights key roles such as messengers, protectors, servants, and instruments of God's will. However, deducting points for the ending paragraph which introduces an atheistic perspective, as it deviates from a Christian worldview and introduces a viewpoint that undermines the foundation of angelic beliefs within Christianity. A more focused discussion solely on the biblical references and Christian perspectives would have been more appropriate in this context."
