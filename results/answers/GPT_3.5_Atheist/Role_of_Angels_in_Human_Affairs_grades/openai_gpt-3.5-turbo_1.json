It acknowledges that angels serve God by delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening believers, and acting as intermediaries. The mention of angels communicating as if they are speaking for God aligns well with the Christian view of angels as messengers. However, the response could further elaborate on how understanding these roles can impact Christians' perception of divine intervention in their lives, connecting the roles of angels to the broader concept of divine guidance and protection in Christian faith."
