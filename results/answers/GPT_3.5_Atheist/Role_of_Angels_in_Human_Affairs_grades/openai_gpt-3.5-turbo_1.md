# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Judeo-Christian tradition, angels are believed to serve God in various ways as messengers, protectors, and servants. They are often depicted as beings who carry out God's will and act as intermediaries between God and humanity. In the Bible, angels are recorded as delivering important messages to prophets and individuals, guarding and guiding believers, and praising and worshipping God in heavenly realms. They are also seen as instruments of God's judgment and justice, executing divine punishment on sinners or enemies of God.

It is important to note that these beliefs and interpretations are rooted in religious faith and may vary among different theological traditions and interpretations. From an atheistic perspective, angels are seen as mythological or metaphorical beings created by human imagination to personify various aspects of the divine. Their roles and functions are symbolic representations of human values, virtues, and experiences, rather than literal beings serving a supernatural deity.

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the roles of angels according to the Judeo-Christian tradition. It acknowledges that angels serve God by delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening believers, and acting as intermediaries. The mention of angels communicating as if they are speaking for God aligns well with the Christian view of angels as messengers. However, the response could further elaborate on how understanding these roles can impact Christians' perception of divine intervention in their lives, connecting the roles of angels to the broader concept of divine guidance and protection in Christian faith.
