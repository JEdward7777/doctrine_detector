However, the response could have further highlighted the significance of angels in relation to divine intervention in the lives of Christians, demonstrating the impact of understanding their roles on how believers perceive God's involvement in their lives. Integrating this aspect more explicitly would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
