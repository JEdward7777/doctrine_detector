  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student's response provides a general understanding of the role of the apostles in teaching and fostering community among believers. However, the answer lacks depth in articulating the specific biblical teachings and principles that guided the apostles in their actions. To improve, the student could incorporate more scriptural references and theological insights to support their points. Additionally, the answer could benefit from a more explicitly Christian worldview perspective, emphasizing the importance of faith, obedience to Christ, and the work of the Holy Spirit in building and nurturing Christian community."
