## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's response a 70.

While the student's answer touches on important aspects such as the role of apostles in fostering community, providing support, and addressing conflicts, there is a lack of emphasis on the core elements highlighted in the reference answer - teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer. These key components are central to understanding community and teaching as integral aspects of church life as modeled by the apostles. The student's answer could be improved by focusing more specifically on these foundational elements.
