Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of community and teaching in church life, as modeled by the apostles. It highlights their role in establishing unity among believers, providing support and guidance, and addressing conflicts. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific practices mentioned in the correct answer, such as teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer.

To improve, the response could have more directly connected the apostles' actions to these specific practices and emphasized their importance for the growth and unity of the early church. Nonetheless, the response shows a good grasp of the overall themes and lessons from the apostles' example.
