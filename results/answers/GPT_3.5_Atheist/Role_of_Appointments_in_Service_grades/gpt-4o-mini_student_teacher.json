  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer primarily focuses on the sociological aspects of fulfilling roles within the Church, emphasizing adherence to cultural norms and expectations. While the response provides some insight into how roles are determined and the importance of fulfilling them for the functioning of the Church community, it lacks a clear connection to the Christian worldview. The answer misses the crucial aspect of serving others, using gifts for the edification of the Church, and advancing God's kingdom, which are essential components of fulfilling roles within the Church from a Christian perspective. More emphasis on the spiritual aspect of serving and fulfilling roles within the body of Christ is needed for a higher grade."
