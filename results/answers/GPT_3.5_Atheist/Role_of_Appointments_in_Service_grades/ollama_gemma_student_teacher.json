While it acknowledges the influence of theological beliefs and scriptures, the answer primarily emphasizes the social exchange aspect of these roles.\n\nWhile this approach offers a relevant sociological perspective, it fails to fully address the Christian worldview concern, which emphasizes the theological basis and spiritual motivation for fulfilling appointed roles. The student's answer would benefit from incorporating a deeper exploration of the Christian belief in serving others and advancing God's kingdom as a primary motivation for fulfilling these roles."
