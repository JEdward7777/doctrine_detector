  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response generally addresses the concern about the responsibility of believers in their appointed tasks and service within the body of Christ. It mentions the importance of fulfilling roles within the Church, including those of clergy and lay members, which aligns with the given answer's emphasis on serving others and using gifts for the edification of the Church.\n\nThe response also provides a clear explanation of how these roles contribute to social cohesion and functioning within the Church community, as well as how they can be seen from a secular perspective as a form of social exchange. However, it could have more explicitly connected these points back to the biblical concept of serving others and advancing God's kingdom, which is the main idea emphasized in the given answer.\n\nTo increase the grade, the response could have provided more direct links between its descriptions of Church roles and service, and the concept of faithfully fulfilling appointed tasks for the glory of God."
