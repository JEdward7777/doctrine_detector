However, the response could have delved deeper into the Christian perspective on sacrifice and atonement, connecting the Passover event to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the concept of atonement for sin through His blood. Emphasizing the theological significance of blood in the Christian faith would have strengthened the response."
