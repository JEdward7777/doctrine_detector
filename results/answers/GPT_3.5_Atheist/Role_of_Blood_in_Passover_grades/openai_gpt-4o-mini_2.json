It effectively connects the use of blood in the Passover event to the importance of obedience and trust in God's protection. However, the response could have further emphasized the connection between the blood of the lamb in the Passover event and the concept of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith. Expanding on this connection would have strengthened the Christian perspective on the significance of blood in the Passover event."
