  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student provides a secular perspective on the role of eunuchs in ancient times, dismissing any connection to divine plans. However, from a Christian worldview, one could argue that even societal constructs and divisions of labor are ultimately within the providence of God. The response lacks an understanding of God's sovereignty and how He works through human institutions and practices. Encouraging the student to consider the Biblical perspective on various roles in society would enhance the depth of their analysis."
