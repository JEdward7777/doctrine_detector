  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the historical context and social practices surrounding eunuchs in ancient times. They rightly point out the practical and social factors that likely influenced the practice of employing eunuchs, rather than attributing it to a divine plan. However, the response could have benefited from a more explicit acknowledgment of the potential spiritual or symbolic significance of eunuchs in some ancient cultures, as suggested by the teacher's reference answer."
