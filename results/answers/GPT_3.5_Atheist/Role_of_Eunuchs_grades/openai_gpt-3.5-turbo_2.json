However, the response also emphasizes practical considerations and societal constructs as reasons for the historical role of eunuchs, implying a more secular perspective that downplays the potential divine significance of their roles. Encouraging a more explicit connection to God's sovereignty and intentionality when discussing historical practices involving individuals would enhance the alignment with a Christian worldview."
