However, it falls short in fully embracing the Christian worldview perspective that God can use anyone, including eunuchs, to fulfill His purposes. The response focuses more on societal and cultural explanations rather than attributing significance to God's plan and sovereignty in the appointment of eunuchs to important positions. There is room for further integration of Christian beliefs about God's intentional use of individuals for His purposes in the evaluation of historical practices."
