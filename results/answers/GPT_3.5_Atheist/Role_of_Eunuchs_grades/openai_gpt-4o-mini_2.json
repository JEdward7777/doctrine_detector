However, the response failed to address the Christian concern regarding the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom. It missed the opportunity to integrate the concept of God using anyone, regardless of physical or social status, to fulfill His purposes. Integrating a Christian worldview perspective would have significantly improved the relevance and depth of the response."
