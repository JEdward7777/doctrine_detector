## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the context of ancient Jewish beliefs, the concept of the kingdom referred to the anticipated restoration of Israel as a sovereign nation under the rule of a righteous king, who was also known as the Messiah or the Anointed One. This king was believed to be a descendant of King David and was expected to usher in an era of peace, justice, and divine favor for the people of Israel.

Jesus, as claimed by his followers, was seen as fulfilling this Messianic role. However, it is crucial to note that Jesus redefined the notion of the kingdom to be not only a physical political entity but also a spiritual reality. He preached about the Kingdom of God, emphasizing values such as love, compassion, and humility. Jesus' proclamation of the kingdom challenged the existing religious norms and social structures of his time.

Therefore, the concept of the kingdom in relation to Jesus as the Messiah highlights the transformative and spiritual nature of his message. Jesus offered a vision of a kingdom where the marginalized and oppressed were uplifted, where forgiveness and redemption were central, and where the ultimate authority resided in God rather than in human rulers. This understanding of the kingdom as both a present reality and a future hope is integral to Jesus' identity as the Messiah in Christian belief.
