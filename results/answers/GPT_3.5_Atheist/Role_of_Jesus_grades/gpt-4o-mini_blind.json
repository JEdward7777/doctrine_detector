However, it could be improved by also mentioning the concept of Jesus as the perfect mediator between humanity and God, emphasizing the necessity of a personal relationship with Him for salvation. Additionally, expanding on the significance of Jesus' resurrection in defeating sin and death would enhance the completeness of the answer."
