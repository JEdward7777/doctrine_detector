  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response effectively explains how the prophet Nathan used a parable to confront King David about his sins of adultery and murder. The student accurately identifies the purpose of the parable as a means to prompt David to repentance and acknowledges the moral lesson conveyed. The only minor deduction is for some slight verbosity compared to the reference answer, but overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the use of parables for correction and revelation in biblical narratives from a Christian worldview."
