  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the use of parables in biblical narratives. The student effectively analyzes the parable of the rich man and the poor man, highlighting the parallels between the king's judgment of the rich man and his own sinfulness. The conclusion drawn about the parabolic method of delivering rebuke and conveying moral lessons is also accurate and well-supported by the text."
