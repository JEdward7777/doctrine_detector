# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, the prophet Nathan utilized a parable to confront King David about his adultery with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband Uriah. Nathan cleverly told the story of a rich man who took a poor man's only beloved lamb instead of using one of his own many lambs for a feast. King David, judging this rich man harshly, declared that the man deserved to die for his actions. Nathan then revealed to David that he himself was the rich man in the story, metaphorically highlighting David's own grave sin and prompting him to repent. This use of parable can be seen as a powerful and effective way to deliver a rebuke and convey a moral lesson.
