  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing the various responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, including their role as intermediaries, teachers, and overseers of religious practices. While the student's response covers a broader range of duties beyond what was included in the reference answer, they effectively captured the essence of the priestly responsibilities. However, the specific tasks mentioned in the reference answer were not all explicitly addressed in the student's response, hence a slightly lower grade."
