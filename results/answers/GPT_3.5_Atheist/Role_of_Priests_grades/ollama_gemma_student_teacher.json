  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately covers the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament according to the Bible. It clearly explains their role as intermediaries between the people and God, their responsibility for offering sacrifices and prayers, performing religious rites, teaching the Law, and maintaining the sanctity of the community. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples or references from the Old Testament to support the claims made."
