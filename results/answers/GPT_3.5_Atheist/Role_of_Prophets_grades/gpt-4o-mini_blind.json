  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The answer provides a good overview of the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible, emphasizing their role as messengers of God's will and teachings. The mention of challenging injustice, calling for repentance, and offering hope aligns well with biblical examples. However, the grade is slightly lowered as it could have further emphasized the importance of proclaiming the future fulfillment of God's promises through prophecy."
