  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately describes the biblical role of a prophet as one who conveys God's messages to humanity, which aligns with the given answer. It also highlights the prophetic emphasis on warning people about their sins and calling them to repentance, which is consistent with the concern about understanding the biblical role of prophets and their messages.\n\nHowever, the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its description of a prophet's role. For example, it doesn't mention the idea that prophets are often called to challenge injustice or offer hope for the future, which are important aspects of the prophetic ministry. Additionally, while the response correctly emphasizes God's messages being delivered through prophets, it could benefit from more explicit references to Scripture to support this understanding.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the basic biblical concept of prophecy, but could be strengthened by further development and Scriptural support."
