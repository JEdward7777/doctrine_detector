  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the relationship between repentance and forgiveness in the Bible, highlighting the interconnectedness and importance of both concepts. The answer aligns well with the reference answer from a Christian worldview. However, the student could strengthen the response by directly linking the concept of true repentance with seeking forgiveness from God, as emphasized in the reference answer. This clarification would further encourage individuals to pursue genuine repentance in their relationship with God."
