  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system. It correctly highlights their role in overseeing rituals and sacrifices, enforcing purity laws, interpreting religious laws, and their conservative interpretation of the Torah. However, to improve the grade, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological differences between the Sadducees and Pharisees, particularly in relation to beliefs such as the resurrection of the dead and the existence of angels. Additionally, a more explicit mention of the Sadducees' denial of the resurrection and their focus on the literal interpretation of the Torah would have enhanced the doctrinal accuracy of the response."
