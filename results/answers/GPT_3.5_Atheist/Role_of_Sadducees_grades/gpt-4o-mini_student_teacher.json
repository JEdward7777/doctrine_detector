  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the Sadducees' responsibilities within the Jewish temple system, it appears to be overly comprehensive and may include some speculative elements not directly related to the historical context of religious leadership during Jesus' time. The focus should have been more on the specific duties related to the temple and priestly tasks as mentioned in the reference answer. The student demonstrated knowledge but could improve by honing in on key aspects relevant to the context of the time."
