The Sadducees were a sect within ancient Judaism that mainly consisted of the Jewish elite, including priests and aristocrats. In the Jewish temple system, the main responsibilities of the Sadducees included overseeing the rituals and sacrifices that took place in the Temple, ensuring the proper functioning of the sacrificial system, enforcing religious purity laws, and interpreting religious laws. They were also involved in political and administrative affairs, as well as in maintaining social order within the Jewish community. The Sadducees had a more conservative and literal interpretation of the Torah compared to the Pharisees, another Jewish sect at the time.
