  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response only partially addresses the concern of exploring the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus, as it primarily focuses on the Sadducees' role in the temple complex rather than their broader influence on Jewish society and politics during that era. Additionally, while the response mentions some accurate information about the Sadducees' responsibilities, it does not fully capture the complexity of their roles or provide a nuanced understanding of their position within ancient Judaism. The provided answer is also quite simplistic compared to the original response, which provides more detailed and accurate information about the Sadducees' responsibilities and interpretation of the Torah."
