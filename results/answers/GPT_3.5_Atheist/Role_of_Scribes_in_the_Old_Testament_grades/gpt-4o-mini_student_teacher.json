  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures. They accurately highlighted the meticulous nature of scribes' work and how their dedication contributed to the faithful transmission of the texts. However, the student's response slightly elaborated more than necessary compared to the reference answer, which is why the grade is slightly lower."
