  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that effectively illustrates the integration of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message through examples of Jesus and the apostles utilizing Old Testament references. The response demonstrates a good understanding of how the Bible emphasizes the use of Scripture in communicating the Gospel. However, the answer could have been enhanced by directly referencing specific instances like the examples given in the teacher's answer, which would have further highlighted the importance of Scripture in evangelism."
