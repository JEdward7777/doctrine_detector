## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, witnesses play a crucial role in establishing the credibility of the accounts of Jesus' life and resurrection. The Gospels, which detail the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus, often mention eyewitnesses who saw and interacted with Jesus during his ministry on earth.

For example, in the Gospel of Luke, the author states that he has "carefully investigated everything from the beginning" and has "decided to write an orderly account" based on the testimony of "those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses" (Luke 1:2-3). The Gospel of John also emphasizes the role of witnesses, with John the Baptist, the disciples, and others testifying to the ministry and identity of Jesus.

The most significant role of witnesses in the New Testament is in relation to the resurrection of Jesus. The Gospels all record that after his crucifixion, Jesus appeared to various individuals and groups, including his disciples, Mary Magdalene, and more than 500 people at once (1 Corinthians 15:3-8). These witnesses provided firsthand accounts of encountering the risen Jesus, which served to validate the reality of his resurrection.

Overall, witnesses in the New Testament serve as key sources of information and verification for the events surrounding the life and resurrection of Jesus, lending credibility to the accounts presented in the biblical texts.
