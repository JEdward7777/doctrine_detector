  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the importance of witnesses in the New Testament, specifically highlighting their role in establishing the credibility of the accounts surrounding Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. The discussion is clear and concise, with examples from the Gospels to support the main point. Additionally, the response emphasizes the significance of eyewitness testimony, which is a crucial aspect of biblical history.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly connect the dots between the importance of witnesses in the New Testament and the call for Christians to witness their faith today. While it's implied that this is the next logical step, it would be beneficial to make this connection more explicit.\n\nThe concern about Christians sharing personal experiences of God's work in their lives is not directly addressed in the response. To better align with the concern, the response could have explored how the examples of witnesses in the New Testament can inspire and encourage contemporary believers to share their own testimonies.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a solid foundation, it falls short of explicitly highlighting the connection between biblical witness and personal testimony, which is the primary concern."
