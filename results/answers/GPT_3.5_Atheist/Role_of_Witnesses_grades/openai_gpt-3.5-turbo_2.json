It accurately highlights how witnesses in the New Testament provided firsthand accounts of encountering Jesus, which is analogous to the call for Christians to share their own experiences of God's work in their lives. The response effectively incorporates Christian worldview principles in understanding the significance of sharing personal testimonies."
