The mention of the Day of Atonement ceremony and sacrifices, as well as the high priest's lifelong position and special access to consult with God through the Urim and Thummim, demonstrates a solid comprehension of the topic. The explanation could be enhanced by mentioning the high priest's role in carrying out specific duties within the Tabernacle/Temple, such as entering the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement. Additionally, incorporating references to specific Old Testament passages that outline the high priest's responsibilities would strengthen the response."
