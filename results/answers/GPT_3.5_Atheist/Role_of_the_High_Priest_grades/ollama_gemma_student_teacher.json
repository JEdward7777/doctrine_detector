  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the unique responsibilities of the high priest in ancient Israel. They clearly explain the high priest's role as the chief religious authority, their responsibility for performing rituals and offering sacrifices, and their authority to consult with God. However, the response could benefit from additional elaboration on the high priest's unique access to the most holy part of the tabernacle or temple, which is mentioned in the reference answer."
