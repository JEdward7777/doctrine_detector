The response effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the high priest's central role in worship practices, showcasing a strong understanding of their significance in religious activities. The only minor improvement would be to connect the mention of the high priest's yearly sacrifice in the provided answer to the broader context of their overall responsibilities in maintaining the worship practices of Israel."
