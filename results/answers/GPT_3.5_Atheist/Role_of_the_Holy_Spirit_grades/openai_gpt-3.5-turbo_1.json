While it acknowledges the significance of spiritual empowerment in religious communities, it falls short in directly addressing the essential Christian belief that the Holy Spirit empowers believers for spiritual growth and guidance in Christian living. The response could have emphasized more explicitly the critical role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life according to Christian teachings."
