The perspective presented focuses more on the historical, sociological, and personal aspects of spiritual empowerment rather than emphasizing the foundational role of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life as essential for producing good spiritual fruit. There is a need for a deeper exploration and affirmation of the significance of the Holy Spirit in shaping and guiding a believer's journey in Christianity."
