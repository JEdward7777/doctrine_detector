  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The response shows a good attempt at exploring the symbolic significance of the Holy Spirit in creation narratives, but it falls short from a Christian worldview perspective. It presents a mix of cultural and atheistic interpretations, lacking a clear affirmation of the biblical understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in creation as part of the Triune Godhead. The student should incorporate more scriptural references and theological insights to fully align with a Christian-specific worldview."
