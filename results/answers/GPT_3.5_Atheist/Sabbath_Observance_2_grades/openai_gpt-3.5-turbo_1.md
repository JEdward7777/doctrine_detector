# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The story of God instructing the Israelites on how to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath is found in the Book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical account, God provided manna to the Israelites as food during their journey in the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.

God instructed the Israelites to gather twice as much manna on the sixth day of the week (Friday) because no manna would be provided on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath. This was to ensure that the Israelites had enough food to sustain them on the Sabbath day without needing to gather manna, thus allowing them to rest and observe the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.

This story serves as a reminder of the importance of honoring and observing the Sabbath day as a day of rest and spiritual reflection in the Jewish tradition.
