Keeping the Sabbath holy, according to the commandments given to Moses in the Bible, typically refers to setting aside one day a week (usually Saturday for Jewish tradition or Sunday for Christian tradition) for rest, reflection, worship, and spiritual rejuvenation. This commandment is meant to honor the belief that God rested on the seventh day after creating the universe, and it serves as a reminder for believers to take a break from their daily responsibilities and focus on their relationship with the divine. 

However, it is important to note that interpretations and practices surrounding the Sabbath can vary among different religious traditions and denominations. Some may emphasize strict observance of abstaining from work and engaging in religious activities, while others may focus more on the spirit of rest and rejuvenation without strict regulations. Ultimately, keeping the Sabbath holy is about honoring one's spiritual beliefs and values in a way that brings meaning and fulfillment to one's life.
