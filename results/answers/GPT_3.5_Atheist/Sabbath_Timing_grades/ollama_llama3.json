  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response generally meets the concern of recognizing the specific timeframe for the observance of the Sabbath, but could be improved in terms of accuracy and detail. While it correctly identifies the start time as sundown on Friday, it only mentions the duration as \"until Saturday at sundown\", which is a significant part of the correct timeframe (nightfall). To achieve a higher grade, the response should provide more precise information about the Sabbath's end time."
