  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThe answer provides a good understanding of sacrificial love as demonstrated by Jesus, highlighting the importance of selfless giving and prioritizing the well-being of others. It correctly references Jesus as the ultimate example of sacrificial love through his teachings and sacrifice on the cross. The response effectively connects sacrificial love to Christian values of compassion, empathy, and recognizing the worth of every individual.\n\nHowever, to improve the grade, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological significance of Jesus' sacrificial love, emphasizing themes such as atonement, redemption, and God's love for humanity. Furthermore, integrating specific biblical references or examples of Jesus' sacrificial love could add more depth to the response. Engaging more explicitly with Christian doctrine and Scripture would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
