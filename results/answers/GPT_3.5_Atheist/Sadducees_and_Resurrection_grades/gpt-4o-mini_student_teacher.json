  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a clear explanation of the belief of the Sadducees and effectively contrasts it with Christian teaching regarding resurrection. They address the differences in beliefs and their implications for faith, as requested in the concern. The only improvement could be a more concise presentation similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
