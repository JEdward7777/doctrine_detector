## [Answer](../Sadducees_and_Resurrection.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Sadducees were a Jewish sect during the Second Temple period who did not believe in the resurrection of the dead. They held a more conservative and literal interpretation of the Torah, specifically rejecting the idea of an afterlife or resurrection. This belief set them apart from other Jewish groups, such as the Pharisees, who did believe in resurrection and life after death.

In contrast, Christian teaching, particularly within the New Testament, emphasizes the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the hope of resurrection for all believers. Christians believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead and the promise of eternal life. This belief is central to Christian faith and is seen as a core doctrine that sets Christianity apart from other religions, including the beliefs of the Sadducees.
