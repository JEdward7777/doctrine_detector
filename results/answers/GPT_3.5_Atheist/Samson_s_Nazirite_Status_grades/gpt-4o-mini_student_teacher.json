However, the answer lacks deeper analysis regarding the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives, which was the specified concern. It would have been beneficial for the student to integrate more insights on how Samson's actions directly impacted his divine purpose and the importance of personal commitment in fulfilling God's plan."
