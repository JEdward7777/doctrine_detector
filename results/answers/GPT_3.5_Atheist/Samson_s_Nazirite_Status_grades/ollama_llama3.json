  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of exploring the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in Samson's story, highlighting how his strength was linked to his adherence to the Nazirite vow. The writer provides specific examples from the Bible to support their claim, including Samson's hair as a symbol of his commitment. The conclusion effectively ties back to the concern, emphasizing the importance of obeying God's commandments and honoring sacred vows.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are minor: the response could benefit from more nuanced exploration of the themes and less repetition of certain points. Additionally, while the writer does an excellent job of highlighting Samson's failures, they could also have explored his successes and how they relate to his commitment to God's purpose.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively explores the concern and provides relevant biblical examples to support its claims."
