  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of sanctification in the New Testament, emphasizing the role of believers in aligning themselves with the teachings of Jesus and allowing the Holy Spirit to work within them. However, the student's answer does not specifically address the concern of recognizing the role of faith in the sanctification process. A stronger connection to the importance of faith in trusting God's sanctifying work would enhance the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
