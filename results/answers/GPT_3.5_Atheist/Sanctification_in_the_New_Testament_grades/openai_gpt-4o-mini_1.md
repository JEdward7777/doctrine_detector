The New Testament depicts sanctification as the process by which believers in Jesus are set apart and become more like Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit. This transformation involves renewal of the mind, obedience to God's commands, and growth in virtues such as love, patience, and kindness.

The apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of believers living holy lives, being transformed by the renewing of their minds, and putting off the old self to put on the new self in Christ. He also urges believers to walk in the Spirit and bear the fruit of the Spirit, which includes love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
