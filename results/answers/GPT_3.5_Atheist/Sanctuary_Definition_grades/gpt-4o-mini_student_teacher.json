The answer also correctly mentions the Tabernacle and Temple as central sanctuaries. However, there is minor deviation from the reference answer in the broader sense explanation of sanctuary as a place of refuge for individuals accused of manslaughter. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of the concept with a good level of detail and insight."
