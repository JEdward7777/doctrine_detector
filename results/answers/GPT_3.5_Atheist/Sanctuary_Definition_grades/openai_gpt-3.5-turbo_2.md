In the context of the Bible, a sanctuary refers to a sacred place where people come to worship and seek spiritual solace. In the Old Testament, the sanctuary typically refers to the Tabernacle or Temple, which were the central places of worship for the Israelites. These were considered holy places where God's presence was believed to dwell.

In a broader sense, sanctuary can also refer to a place of refuge or safety. In the Bible, cities of refuge were designated as safe havens for individuals accused of accidental manslaughter to seek protection from vengeful family members seeking retribution.

Overall, the concept of sanctuary in the Bible conveys the idea of a place set apart for worship, spiritual reflection, and protection, emphasizing the importance of both the physical and spiritual aspects of a sacred space.
