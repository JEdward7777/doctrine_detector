The discussion of the Tabernacle and Temple as examples of sanctuaries in the Old Testament, along with the reference to cities of refuge as places of safety, further enriches the explanation. The response effectively conveys the dual nature of sanctuary in providing both physical and spiritual refuge, aligning well with a Christian worldview."
