  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 85.\n\nThe answer correctly states that in the Old Testament, God described the sanctuary as a place where He dwelt among His people and where His presence resided. It also mentions that the sanctuary was considered a sacred space for offering sacrifices, seeking forgiveness, and worshiping God. However, the answer could have been improved by emphasizing that God's presence in the sanctuary was a reflection of His holiness and a means for maintaining the Israelites' relationship with Him. Additionally, it could have touched upon the significance of the sanctuary in foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ in the New Testament."
