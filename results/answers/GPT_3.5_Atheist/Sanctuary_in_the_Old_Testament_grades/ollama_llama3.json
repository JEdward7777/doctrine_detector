  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response generally addresses the concern by recognizing the importance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God (although it doesn't explicitly state that). It also touches on the idea of the sanctuary being a safe place for the Israelites, which is in line with the concern. However, the response could be improved by providing more details about what made the sanctuary significant and how it reflected God's presence among His people.\n\nThe key similarity between this response and the ideal answer is that both recognize the sanctuary as a place where God dwelt among His people and provided safety. The main difference is that the ideal answer provides more context and depth in its description of the sanctuary, whereas this response is more superficial. Nevertheless, it's a good start, and with some additional development, it could be even stronger.\n\nComment: While this response shows an understanding of the basic idea behind the concern, it could benefit from more detail and nuance to truly demonstrate a deep grasp of the importance of the sanctuary in biblical theology."
