The connection between the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of protection for His people is addressed well, reflecting a good understanding of the significance of the sanctuary in the Old Testament. However, there could be a bit more expansion on how the sanctuary symbolized the holiness of God and the importance of rituals like sacrifices in seeking forgiveness and worshiping Him."
