However, the commentary on beliefs about hell and Satan as cultural constructs from an atheistic perspective is not in line with the Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, beliefs about hell and the fate of Satan are not merely cultural constructs but are rooted in the authority of Scripture. The response would benefit from providing a more balanced view that respects the doctrinal beliefs of Christianity."
