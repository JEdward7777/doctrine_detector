In Christian theology, Satan is indeed cast into hell for eternal punishment, not as a mere cultural construct. The atheistic perspective presented disregards the foundational beliefs of Christianity and fails to acknowledge the significance of Satan's fate in the broader understanding of the struggle between good and evil within Christian theology."
