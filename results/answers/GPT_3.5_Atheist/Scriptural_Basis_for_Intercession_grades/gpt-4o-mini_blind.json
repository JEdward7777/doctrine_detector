  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of interceding for others in a Christian context by referencing relevant Bible verses such as 1 Timothy 2:1-2 and James 5:16. The explanation of the importance and power of intercessory prayer is clear and aligns well with Christian belief. However, the response could have been strengthened by including additional verses that further support the practice of interceding for others."
