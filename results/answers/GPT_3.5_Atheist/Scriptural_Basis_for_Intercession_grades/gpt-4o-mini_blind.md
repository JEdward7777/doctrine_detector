In the Bible, interceding for others is a common practice that is highlighted in several verses. One example is found in 1 Timothy 2:1-2, which says, "I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all peopleâ€” for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness." This verse emphasizes the importance of praying for others, including those in positions of power.

Another verse that emphasizes interceding for others is James 5:16, which states, "Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." This verse highlights the power of prayer and how it can lead to healing and restoration when done on behalf of others.

Overall, the practice of interceding for others is a key aspect of many religious traditions, including Christianity. It reflects the idea of caring for and supporting others in times of need, and is seen as a way to demonstrate love and compassion for those around us.
