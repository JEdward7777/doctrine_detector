The additional mention of relevant verses (Hebrews 7:25-26, Isaiah 53:12, Jeremiah 29:6-7, Romans 8:26-27, Romans 8:33-34) strengthens the scriptural foundation for understanding intercessory prayer. Encouraging believers to explore specific verses on prayer and intercession from the Bible aligns well with a Christian worldview."
