  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear explanation of the concept of propitiation in Christian theology, supported by relevant biblical verses (Romans 3:25 and 1 John 4:10). The explanation accurately captures the essence of propitiation as Jesus' sacrifice appeasing the wrath of God for the forgiveness of sins. Well done."
