## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Propitiation is a concept commonly found in Christian theology, primarily in the context of atonement for sin. The idea is that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross appeased the wrath of God, making reconciliation possible between humanity and God. One biblical verse that supports this concept is Romans 3:25, which states, "whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith." Another verse is 1 John 4:10, which says, "In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." These verses highlight the belief that Jesus' sacrifice serves as a propitiation for sin, allowing for forgiveness and reconciliation with God.
