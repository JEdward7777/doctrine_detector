  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 85. The student effectively connects the concept of propitiation with biblical references by citing Romans 3:25 and 1 John 4:10. They accurately explain that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross appeased the wrath of God, enabling reconciliation between humanity and God. However, the reference answer provides an additional verse, 1 John 2:2, which the student overlooked. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept and supports it with appropriate biblical references."
