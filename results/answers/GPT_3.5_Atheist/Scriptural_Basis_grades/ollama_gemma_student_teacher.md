## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Propitiation is a concept commonly found in Christian theology, primarily in the context of atonement for sin. The idea is that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross appeased the wrath of God, making reconciliation possible between humanity and God. One biblical verse that supports this concept is Romans 3:25, which states, "whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith." Another verse is 1 John 4:10, which says, "In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." These verses highlight the belief that Jesus' sacrifice serves as a propitiation for sin, allowing for forgiveness and reconciliation with God.

**Grade:** 85

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of propitiation and its significance in Christian theology. They provide relevant biblical references to support their claims and connect them to the concept of atonement. However, including the additional key verses suggested by the teacher would have elevated the grade further.
