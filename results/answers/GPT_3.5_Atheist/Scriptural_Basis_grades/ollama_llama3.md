## Question [Scriptural Basis](../../../questions/Scriptural_Basis.md)
Which Bible verses support the concept of propitiation?

## Correct Answer
Key verses include 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26, which all highlight Jesus as the propitiation for our sins.

## Stated Concern
To connect the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Propitiation is a concept commonly found in Christian theology, primarily in the context of atonement for sin. The idea is that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross appeased the wrath of God, making reconciliation possible between humanity and God. One biblical verse that supports this concept is Romans 3:25, which states, "whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith." Another verse is 1 John 4:10, which says, "In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." These verses highlight the belief that Jesus' sacrifice serves as a propitiation for sin, allowing for forgiveness and reconciliation with God.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response does a good job connecting the theological concept of propitiation with biblical references, specifically citing Romans 3:25 and 1 John 4:10. The inclusion of these verses provides evidence for the concept and helps to illustrate its relevance to Christian theology. Additionally, the response's focus on Jesus' sacrifice as a means of reconciling humanity and God is a crucial aspect of Christian doctrine.

However, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the concept of propitiation to the given answer (i.e., the key verses). While it does mention some similar biblical references, it doesn't directly link them to the specific concern of exploring the theological concept through deeper understanding. This connection is what drives the grade down from a perfect score.

Comment: The response provides a good starting point for exploring the concept of propitiation, but could be strengthened by more explicitly linking the scriptural evidence to the given answer and concern.
