The inclusion of key verses such as 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26 helps to strengthen the explanation of Jesus as the propitiation for sins. However, it could have been enhanced by providing a bit more elaboration on how these verses specifically relate to the concept of propitiation within Christian theology."
