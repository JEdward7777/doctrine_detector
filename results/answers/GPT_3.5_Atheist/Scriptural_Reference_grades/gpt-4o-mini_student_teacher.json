  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student provided a thorough explanation of biblical passages that address the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers. They referenced relevant verses and effectively explained how believers are called to live in contrast to the values of the world. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by referencing additional biblical passages, particularly those mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and effectively applied a Christian worldview to address the concern raised."
