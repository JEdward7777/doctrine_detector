## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, the concept of the "world" is often used to refer to the prevalent sinful and corrupt systems of human society that are opposed to the values of God and his kingdom. In relation to believers, several passages discuss the tension between the world and followers of God:

1 John 2:15-17 - "Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever."

John 15:18-19 - "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you."

Romans 12:2 - "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."

These passages emphasize the idea that believers are called to live in contrast to the values and ways of the world, and to remain faithful to God even when faced with opposition or persecution.
