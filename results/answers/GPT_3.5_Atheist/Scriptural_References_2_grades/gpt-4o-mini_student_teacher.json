  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded answer citing relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments that support the concept of the day of judgment. While they did not include the specific passages mentioned in the reference answer, their selection was still appropriate and demonstrated a good understanding of the topic. The answer effectively reinforces the scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment."
