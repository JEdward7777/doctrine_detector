## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of the day of judgment in the Bible is found in various passages in both the Old and New Testaments. Here are a few passages that are commonly referenced:

1. Ecclesiastes 12:14 - "For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil."

2. Matthew 25:31-46 - The Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, in which Jesus describes the final judgment where the righteous are separated from the wicked.

3. 2 Corinthians 5:10 - "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad."

4. Revelation 20:11-15 - The Great White Throne Judgment, where the dead are judged according to their deeds before being cast into the lake of fire.

These passages illustrate the belief in a final day of judgment where individuals will be held accountable for their actions and ultimately face the consequences of their choices.
