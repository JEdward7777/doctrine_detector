  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of key passages related to the concept of the day of judgment in the Bible, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. It effectively references relevant passages and explains the belief in a final day of judgment. However, the response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern raised and providing more detailed explanations or insights from the specified key passages."
