The inclusion of specific passages such as Ecclesiastes 12:14, Matthew 25:31-46, 2 Corinthians 5:10, and Revelation 20:11-15 demonstrates a solid understanding and application of scripture to the concept of judgment. The response effectively reinforces the scriptural basis for beliefs related to the day of judgment."
