  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the passage from Matthew 23:27-28 and has accurately explained the emphasis on hypocrisy and the importance of genuine intentions and actions in morality. They effectively conveyed the message about iniquity corrupting one's true character despite outward appearances. The student could enhance their answer by explicitly tying in the Christian worldview perspective and the consequences of iniquity as taught in scripture."
