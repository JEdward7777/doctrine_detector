  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 80.\n\nThe student has provided a solid understanding of the passage and its implications regarding the nature of iniquity, addressing the concern raised about pursuing genuine holiness versus mere external compliance. The explanation is clear and insightful, connecting the verses to the importance of sincerity and authenticity in ethical conduct. However, there is a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer in terms of focusing on the corruption of true character by iniquity. Overall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the topic and effectively applies it to the Christian perspective."
