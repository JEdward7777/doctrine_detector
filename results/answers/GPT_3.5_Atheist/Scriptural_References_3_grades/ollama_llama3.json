  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately captures the essence of Matthew 23:27-28, highlighting the distinction between outward appearances and inner righteousness. It also correctly emphasizes the importance of integrity in one's faith.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the passage's message to the concern about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards. While the response mentions \"importance of integrity,\" it would be strengthened by more directly applying this concept to the Christian's pursuit of holiness.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical passage and its relevance to Christian living, but could benefit from further development in connecting the dots between the text and the concern."
