  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively draws on the passage from Matthew 23:27-28 to highlight the importance of sincerity and integrity in one's faith, aligning well with the concern provided. The explanation of iniquity as a deep-seated moral failing that corrupts true character is well articulated from a Christian worldview perspective. The focus on genuine holiness over mere external compliance to religious standards is clearly conveyed in the response. Overall, the analysis is insightful and well-supported."
