## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Passages like Matthew 23:27-28 emphasize the hypocrisy and shallowness of those who outwardly appear righteous but inwardly are full of iniquity. This highlights the idea that true morality and righteousness cannot be based solely on superficial displays of piety, but must stem from genuine intentions and actions. Iniquity, in this context, is seen as a deep-seated moral failing that corrupts one's true character, regardless of outward appearances. It teaches us the importance of sincerity and authenticity in ethical conduct, rather than mere outward observance of religious practices.
