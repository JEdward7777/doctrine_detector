## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_5.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of Hades in the New Testament does indeed show a shift from being a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous. One key verse that reflects this shift is found in the Gospel of Luke, specifically in Luke 16:19-31, the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. In this parable, Jesus describes Hades as a place where the unrighteous rich man is in torment, while the righteous Lazarus is comforted in the afterlife. This depiction aligns with the evolving understanding of Hades as a place of punishment for the unrighteous rather than a neutral underworld for all the dead.
