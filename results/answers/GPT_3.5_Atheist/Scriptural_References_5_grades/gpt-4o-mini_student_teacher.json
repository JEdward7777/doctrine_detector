  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation supported by scripture, specifically referencing the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31, which aligns with the teacher's reference answer from Luke 16:23. However, the student could have further strengthened their answer by mentioning Luke 23:43 as in the teacher's reference answer for a more comprehensive response."
