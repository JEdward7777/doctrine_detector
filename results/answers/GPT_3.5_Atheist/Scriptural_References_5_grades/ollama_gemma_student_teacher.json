They effectively cite the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) as evidence of this shift, highlighting the contrasting fates of the righteous and unrighteous in the afterlife. The inclusion of additional verses (Luke 16:23 and 23:43) strengthens the argument. The response is well-written and demonstrates a solid grasp of Christian eschatology related to Hades."
