  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does provide some relevant scriptural evidence, specifically citing Luke 16:19-31 as an example of Hades being depicted as a place of torment for the unrighteous. However, it doesn't quite meet the concern's requirement to \"expanding knowledge\" of scriptural evidence, as it only references one passage (Luke 16:23) and briefly mentions another (Luke 23:43).\n\nTo improve this response, the author could have provided more comprehensive analysis and exploration of the scriptural evidence, including additional passages or perspectives that further illuminate the nature of Hades. Additionally, a clearer connection between the biblical text and its implications for Christian eschatology would strengthen the overall response.\n\nOverall, while the response shows some good effort in engaging with scriptural evidence, it falls short of fully addressing the concern to expand knowledge on this topic."
