# Question [Scriptural References 5](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_5.md)
Which New Testament verses indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous?

# Correct Answer
Luke 16:23 depicts Hades as a place for the unrighteous, while Luke 23:43 refers to 'paradise' for the righteous, illustrating this shift.

# Stated Concern
Expanding knowledge of scriptural evidence regarding the nature of Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology.

# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of Hades in the New Testament does indeed show a shift from being a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous. One key verse that reflects this shift is found in the Gospel of Luke, specifically in Luke 16:19-31, the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. In this parable, Jesus describes Hades as a place where the unrighteous rich man is in torment, while the righteous Lazarus is comforted in the afterlife. This depiction aligns with the evolving understanding of Hades as a place of punishment for the unrighteous rather than a neutral underworld for all the dead.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the shift in understanding regarding Hades in the New Testament, specifically referencing Luke 16:19-31 and the contrast between the fate of the unrighteous rich man and the righteous Lazarus. By connecting it to Luke 16:23 and 23:43, the response effectively demonstrates how the concept of Hades aligns with Christian eschatology. The analysis could be further strengthened by delving deeper into other relevant scriptural passages, but overall, the response effectively addresses the concern raised.
