## Question [Scriptural References 5](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_5.md)
Which New Testament verses indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous?

## Correct Answer
Luke 16:23 depicts Hades as a place for the unrighteous, while Luke 23:43 refers to 'paradise' for the righteous, illustrating this shift.

## Stated Concern
Expanding knowledge of scriptural evidence regarding the nature of Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_5.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of Hades in the New Testament does indeed show a shift from being a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous. One key verse that reflects this shift is found in the Gospel of Luke, specifically in Luke 16:19-31, the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. In this parable, Jesus describes Hades as a place where the unrighteous rich man is in torment, while the righteous Lazarus is comforted in the afterlife. This depiction aligns with the evolving understanding of Hades as a place of punishment for the unrighteous rather than a neutral underworld for all the dead.
