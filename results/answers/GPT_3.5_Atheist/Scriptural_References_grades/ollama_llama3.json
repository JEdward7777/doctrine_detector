  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately cites the specific biblical reference to God as \"Almighty\" in Genesis 17:1, which meets the concern of knowing biblical references to deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises. The additional context about God's instruction to Abraham to walk faithfully and be blameless is also relevant and insightful.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by providing more context or explanation about why this reference is significant or how it relates to God's promises in Genesis. For example, one could discuss how this title emphasizes God's power and sovereignty, which is an important theme throughout the book of Genesis.\n\nOverall, while the response is accurate and relevant, it could benefit from a bit more depth and analysis to fully explore the concern of knowing biblical references and their significance for our connection to Scripture and God's promises."
