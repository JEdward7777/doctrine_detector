Comment: The student provides a solid explanation of the verses and effectively conveys the theme of restoration present in Joel 2:25 and Jeremiah 30:17. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to include additional verses that emphasize restoration to provide a more comprehensive view of the theme in the Bible. Additionally, a stronger connection to the overarching biblical narrative of restoration through Christ could have further enhanced the answer.
