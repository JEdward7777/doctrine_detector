Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided strong biblical verses (Joel 2:25 and Jeremiah 30:17) that emphasize restoration, showing a good understanding of the concept. However, the student missed including some key verses like Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6 that were mentioned in the reference answer. It would have been beneficial to include a wider range of verses to strengthen the argument further.
