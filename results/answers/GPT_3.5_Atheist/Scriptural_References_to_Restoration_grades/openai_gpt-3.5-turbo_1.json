  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively provides two additional Bible verses (Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6) that support the theme of restoration in one's faith journey. These verses complement the verses mentioned in the original response and further emphasize God's promise of renewal and reconciliation. The explanation is concise and aligned with the concern, offering a solid biblical foundation for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey from a Christian worldview."
