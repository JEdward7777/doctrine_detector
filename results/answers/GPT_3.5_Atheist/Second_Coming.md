## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I view the concept of the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds as a symbolic representation within Christian scriptures rather than a literal event. The imagery of coming back on the clouds could be seen as a metaphor for a powerful and awe-inspiring return or a transformational moment in the future.

For believers, this statement may imply a sense of hope, reassurance, and anticipation for the fulfillment of divine promises or the establishment of a better world. It could serve as a reminder of the core teachings and values of Christianity, encouraging believers to live virtuously, seek justice, and prepare for the eventual realization of a utopian vision.

Ultimately, interpreting such statements is subjective and can vary among believers based on their personal beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and religious traditions.
