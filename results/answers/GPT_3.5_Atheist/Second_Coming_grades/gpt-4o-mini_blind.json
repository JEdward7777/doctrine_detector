  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides an atheistic perspective on the concept of the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds, which is not in line with Christian beliefs. The interpretation offered lacks doctrinal correctness and does not recognize the significance of this statement within Christian theology. It would be important for the student to understand and acknowledge the core Christian belief in the second coming of Jesus Christ in a literal sense according to biblical teachings. Encouraging adaptation of a more accurate Christian worldview would significantly improve the grade."
