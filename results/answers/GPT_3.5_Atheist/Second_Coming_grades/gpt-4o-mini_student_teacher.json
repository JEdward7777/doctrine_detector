  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer, while providing an atheistic perspective, misses the mark in addressing the Christian-specific implications of Jesus' statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds. The answer lacks a clear understanding of the Christian belief in the second coming of Christ and its significance for believers' hope and eschatology. There is a focus on metaphorical interpretations rather than acknowledging the theological implications within a Christian worldview. Additionally, the answer does not align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes the return of Jesus as the Messiah and the affirmation of hope in His authority."
