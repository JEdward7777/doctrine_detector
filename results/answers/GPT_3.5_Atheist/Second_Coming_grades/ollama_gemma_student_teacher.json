  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the biblical text and its implications for Christian belief. \n\nThe student correctly points out that the concept of the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds is symbolic and open to interpretation. However, they also acknowledge the hope and reassurance that such a statement holds for believers.\n\nWhile the student's perspective as an atheist scholar adds an interesting dimension to the discussion, it may have been more beneficial to explore the specific Christian perspectives on the second coming of Christ. Overall, the answer provides a balanced and insightful analysis of the text from a Christian worldview."
