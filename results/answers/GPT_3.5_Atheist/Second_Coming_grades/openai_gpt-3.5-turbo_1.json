However, the response falls short in fully addressing the implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' for Christian hope and eschatology as the concern specified. While acknowledging the subjective nature of interpretations is valid, a deeper exploration of the Christian worldview's understanding of Jesus' return as the Messiah and its significance for believers' hope and eschatology would have strengthened the response."
