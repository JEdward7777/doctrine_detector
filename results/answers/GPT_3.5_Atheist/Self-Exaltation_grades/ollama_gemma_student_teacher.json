  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings. It acknowledges the potential for arrogance, judgmentalism, and discrimination. The student also provides relevant examples from both an atheistic and secular perspective. However, the answer would benefit from a more direct connection to the Christian specific worldview by referencing relevant scriptures or theological concepts related to pride and humility."
