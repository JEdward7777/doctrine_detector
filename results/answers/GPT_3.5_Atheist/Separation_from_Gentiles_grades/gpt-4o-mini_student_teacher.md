## [Answer](../Separation_from_Gentiles.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Pharisees, a prominent religious group in ancient Judaism, were concerned about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles due to several reasons. One major reason was their strong belief in maintaining the purity and distinctiveness of the Jewish faith and identity. They believed that associating with Gentiles could lead to the contamination of Jewish religious practices and beliefs.

Furthermore, the Pharisees also believed that close interactions with Gentiles could lead to the adoption of foreign customs and beliefs that were contrary to Jewish law. They were dedicated to upholding the laws and traditions of Judaism, and they saw separation from Gentiles as a way to preserve the integrity of their faith.

Additionally, historical conflicts and tensions between the Jewish people and Gentiles, as well as the prevailing social and political circumstances of the time, also contributed to the Pharisees' concerns about separation. Overall, the Pharisees' desire to maintain Jewish purity and distinctiveness, uphold religious laws, and safeguard against outside influences were key factors in their emphasis on separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles.
