  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the Pharisees' concern about maintaining separation from Gentiles to preserve religious purity and adherence to Jewish laws and traditions. It accurately reflects the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context. The only improvement could be to further elaborate on how this concern aligns with the Pharisees' broader religious beliefs and practices within the Jewish context. Overall, well done."
