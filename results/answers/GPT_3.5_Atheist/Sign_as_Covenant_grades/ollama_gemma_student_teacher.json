  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical narrative and the significance of the rainbow as a symbol of God's mercy and faithfulness. While it does not explicitly state that the rainbow is a covenant, the student correctly points out that it symbolizes a promise not to destroy the earth again. This aligns with the teacher's reference answer."
