  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the cultural and symbolic significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke regarding the birth of Jesus. It correctly identifies the social status of shepherds at that time and how the sign helped establish the credibility of their message. The answer also does well in linking the choice of shepherds to the broader theme of God's inclusive love and salvation for all people. However, to improve the grade, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of the angelic appearance and heavenly chorus, emphasizing the divine intervention and proclamation of the Messiah's birth. Additionally, clear references to biblical passages or theological doctrines would have strengthened the doctrinal correctness of the response."
