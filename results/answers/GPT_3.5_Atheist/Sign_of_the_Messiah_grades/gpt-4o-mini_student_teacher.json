However, the answer focuses more on the social status and inclusivity aspects, rather than directly addressing the specific significance of the sign given to the shepherds regarding the birth of Jesus. To improve, the student could have more explicitly connected the sign of the baby in the manger to the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan, as highlighted in the reference answer."
