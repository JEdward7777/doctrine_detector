## [Answer](../Sign_of_the_Messiah.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the story of the birth of Jesus as told in the Gospel of Luke, the significance of the sign given to the shepherds is multifaceted. From a culturally retributed perspective, the sign given to the shepherds can be seen as a way to establish the credibility of the message they received about the birth of Jesus.

Shepherds were considered lowly and marginalized members of society during that time, and their testimony would not have been highly valued or believed by others. By giving them a sign - in this case, the appearance of an angel and a heavenly chorus - the credibility of their message about the birth of Jesus was elevated. This cultural context is important to understand the impact of the sign given to the shepherds.

Additionally, the choice of shepherds as the recipients of the angelic message also carries symbolic significance. In the biblical narrative, shepherds were often used as symbols of God's care and protection over his people. By appearing to shepherds first, God is sending a message that Jesus came for all people, including the lowly and marginalized.

Overall, the sign given to the shepherds in Luke's account serves to establish the credibility of the good news they received about the birth of Jesus, while also emphasizing the inclusive nature of God's love and salvation for all people, regardless of their social status.
