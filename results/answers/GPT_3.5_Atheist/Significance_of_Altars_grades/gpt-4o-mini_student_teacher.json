However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the specific act of offering as a form of devotion and atonement, as outlined in the reference answer. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of altars in biblical worship and its relevance to Christian faith, but could be more concise and directly aligned with the concern provided."
