  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. The student accurately explains the cultural and religious context of ancient Israelite religion and the implications of this translation choice on understanding the Israelite conception of the divine. The response also aligns well with the specified concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith."
