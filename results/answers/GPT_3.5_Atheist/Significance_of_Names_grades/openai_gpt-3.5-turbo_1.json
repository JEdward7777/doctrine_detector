It shows an awareness of the broader cultural and religious context of ancient Israelite beliefs. However, the response could have further connected this understanding to the Christian faith by explicitly discussing how the translation impacts our understanding of God's character and relational aspect in Christianity. More direct referencing to the Christian perspective would have strengthened the response in addressing the concern provided."
