It connects well with the concern of deepening understanding of God's character by highlighting the symbolic and archetypal qualities of the term and how it relates to the multifaceted nature of the divine. However, to further enhance the Christian perspective, it could have included how recognizing God's attributes through these titles can deepen one's relationship with Him and how Christians can apply this understanding in their faith journey."
