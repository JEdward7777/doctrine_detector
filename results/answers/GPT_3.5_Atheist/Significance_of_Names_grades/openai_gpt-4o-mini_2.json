  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations, highlighting the complex nature of ancient Israelite religion. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the concern of deepening understanding of God's character and relational aspect within the Christian faith. While it delves into the attributes and symbolic qualities associated with 'Shaddai', it could have explicitly tied these points back to how Christians can deepen their understanding of God's character and relational aspect through this translation choice."
