  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of the Day of Pentecost in the New Testament, focusing on the empowerment of the apostles by the Holy Spirit. The answer effectively highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for ministry and spreading the message of Christianity. The student's response aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the empowering work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers. The only improvement could be to explicitly mention the fulfillment of Jesus' promise related to the Holy Spirit, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
