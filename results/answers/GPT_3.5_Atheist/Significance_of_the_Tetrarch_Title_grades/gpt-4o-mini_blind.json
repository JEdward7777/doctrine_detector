They demonstrate a good understanding of how the system operated and provide a specific example with Herod Antipas. The explanation could be enhanced by further connecting the concept of tetrarchs to the religious and social implications within the biblical narrative of Jesus' time. Additionally, more emphasis on the relationship between the tetrarchs and the Jewish people, particularly in relation to the Roman occupation, could deepen the analysis."
