It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding the system of tetrarchs helps believers comprehend the political tensions during Christ's life and ministry. The response could have been strengthened by further connecting the significance of tetrarchs to specific events or interactions in the life of Jesus to deepen the application of this knowledge for believers."
