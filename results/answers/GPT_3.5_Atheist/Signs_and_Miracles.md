## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I do not believe in the divine origin of signs and miracles attributed to figures such as Jesus and the apostles. However, from a cultural perspective, these miraculous events are often considered as evidence of the truth and validity of a particular religious message. The ability to perform miracles was seen as a sign of divine favor and power, lending credibility to the teachings and claims of these religious figures.

In the case of Jesus and the apostles, their miracles were viewed as confirmation of their roles as messengers of God and were instrumental in attracting followers and establishing the early Christian community. The miraculous acts served to demonstrate the authority and truth of their teachings, convincing many that they were indeed divinely inspired.

From a historical and scholarly standpoint, the role of signs and miracles in establishing the credibility of religious messages is a complex and debated issue. While some may view these miraculous events as literal demonstrations of divine power, others may interpret them as symbolic or metaphorical expressions of spiritual truths. Ultimately, the significance of signs and miracles in proving the truth of God's message is a matter of personal belief and interpretation.
