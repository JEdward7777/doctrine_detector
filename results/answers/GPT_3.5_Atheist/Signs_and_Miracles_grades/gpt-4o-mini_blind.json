  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: The student provides a well-articulated description of how signs and miracles were perceived in a cultural context and their impact on attracting followers to Jesus and the apostles. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer falls short by not acknowledging the doctrinal significance of signs and miracles as integral components of God's revelation and the validation of His message. The student dismisses their divine origin and instead presents a relativistic view of miracles without acknowledging their foundational role in demonstrating the power and authority of God. An atheistic perspective does not align with a Christian understanding of the supernatural nature of signs and miracles. The response lacks scriptural references and fails to highlight the supernatural nature of signs and miracles in confirming the truth of God's message."
