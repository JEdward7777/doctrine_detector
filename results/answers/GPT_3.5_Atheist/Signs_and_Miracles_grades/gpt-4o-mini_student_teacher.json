  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful perspective on the role of signs and miracles in establishing the credibility of religious messages, considering different viewpoints such as cultural and historical interpretations. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer lacks acknowledgement of the primary role of signs and miracles as validations of God's power and authority, specifically in affirming Jesus and the apostles as genuine messengers of God. The student's atheistic stance also hinders a complete understanding of the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation within a Christian context."
