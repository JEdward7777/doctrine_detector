  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of the cultural significance of signs and miracles in establishing the credibility of religious figures, specifically Jesus and the apostles. It also touches on the complex issue of interpreting these events from a historical and scholarly standpoint. The writer's acknowledgment that the role of signs and miracles is \"a matter of personal belief and interpretation\" shows an understanding of the subjective nature of faith.\n\nHowever, while the response does mention the idea that signs and miracles demonstrate divine power and authority, it does not directly address the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. The concern specified is to examine this very relationship, and the response only tangentially addresses it. Therefore, I deduct 20 points for not fully engaging with the concern.\n\nComment: The response provides a solid foundation for understanding the cultural significance of signs and miracles in Christian history, but falls short of directly addressing the central concern. To improve, the writer could have explored how faith and trust in God's revelation are intertwined with these miraculous events, rather than simply acknowledging their symbolic or metaphorical nature."
