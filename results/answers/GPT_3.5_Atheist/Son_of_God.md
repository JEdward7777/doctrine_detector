## Question [Son of God](../../questions/Son_of_God.md)
What distinguishes the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus from the term 'sons of God' used for believers?

## Target answer from notes
The title 'Son of God' specifically pertains to Jesus as God's only Son, while 'sons of God' refers broadly to all believers in Christ.

## Concern to grade by
Clarity on this distinction helps avoid confusion in theological discussions.

## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The title "Son of God" as it refers to Jesus in Christian theology carries the unique belief that Jesus is the divine Son of God, the second person of the Holy Trinity. This title denotes his special relationship with God as his only begotten Son, who shares the same divine essence as God.

On the other hand, the term "sons of God" used for believers generally refers to the idea that individuals who have faith in God are adopted as children of God and become heirs to his promises. This relationship is seen as more symbolic and metaphorical, emphasizing the spiritual bond believers have with God rather than being of the same divine essence as Jesus.

So, while both terms speak to a special relationship with God, the title "Son of God" ascribed to Jesus signifies his unique divinity, while "sons of God" for believers points to a more relational and adoptive connection with God.
