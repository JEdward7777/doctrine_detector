The response primarily focuses on the cultural and historical context of the term, which is important, but does not delve deeper into the biblical teachings that support Jesus' divine nature.\n\nThe provided answer, \"The term 'Son of God' refers to Jesus, who is fully God and shares the same nature as God the Father,\" is a more accurate representation of the Christian doctrine. However, this response does not provide a clear understanding of the eternal relationship between Jesus and God, which was the primary concern.\n\nTo improve, the response could have explored biblical passages that demonstrate Jesus' divinity, such as John 1:1-14 or Philippians 2:5-11. Additionally, discussing the Trinity and the concept of the imago Dei (image of God) in human beings could have further illuminated the nature of Jesus' relationship with God."
