However, the inclusion of an atheistic perspective and the emphasis on the term \"Son of God\" as a culturally attributed concept, rather than a theological truth, may undermine the Christian understanding of Jesus' divinity. Additionally, the response lacks a clear affirmation of Jesus' unique and unchanging relationship with God, which is crucial in a Christian worldview."
