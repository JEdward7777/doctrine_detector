However, the mention of an atheistic perspective and the emphasis on the term being a theological belief rather than a historical fact may detract from the acknowledgment of the Christian worldview on Jesus' divinity. More focus on the significance of Jesus as fully God and the implications of this relationship within Christian theology would strengthen the response."
