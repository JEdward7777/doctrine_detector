  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" as it refers to Jesus and the term \"sons of God\" used for believers. They correctly highlight the unique divinity of Jesus as God's only Son compared to the more relational and adoptive connection believers have with God. The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer, demonstrating a solid understanding of the theological concepts involved. The grade is slightly deducted for some unnecessary complexity in the explanation, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised regarding clarity in theological discussions."
