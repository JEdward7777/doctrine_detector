  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" attributed to Jesus and the term \"sons of God\" used for believers. This clarification addresses the concern raised about avoiding confusion in theological discussions. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a bit more elaboration or biblical references to further strengthen the explanation from a Christian-specific worldview."
