## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The term "sons of God" in the context of Genesis 6 has been interpreted in various ways by biblical scholars and theologians. One interpretation is that the "sons of God" refer to angels or divine beings who descended to earth and intermingled with human women, producing offspring who were the "Nephilim," a race of giants. This interpretation is based on the idea that the phrase "sons of God" typically refers to divine beings in other parts of the Bible.

Another interpretation is that the "sons of God" refer to the descendants of Seth, who were righteous and faithful, marrying the descendants of Cain, who were wicked and rebellious. This interpretation emphasizes the contrast between the righteous line of Seth and the wicked line of Cain.

Some scholars also suggest that the term "sons of God" could simply refer to powerful rulers or leaders who were acting arrogantly and tyrannically, leading to the corruption and violence that ultimately led to the flood.

Ultimately, the exact meaning of the term "sons of God" in Genesis 6 is still debated among scholars, and different interpretations offer different insights into the text.
