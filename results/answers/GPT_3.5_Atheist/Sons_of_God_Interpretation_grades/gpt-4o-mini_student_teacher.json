  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded explanation of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, including angels, descendants of Seth, and powerful rulers. They showed a good understanding of biblical scholarship and the complexities of interpreting this term. However, it would have been helpful if the student had drawn a clearer connection between the interpretations and how they impact the overall understanding of the passage in Genesis 6."
