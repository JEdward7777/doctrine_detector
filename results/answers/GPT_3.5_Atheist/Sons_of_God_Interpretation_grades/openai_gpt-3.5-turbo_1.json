While the answer mentions different views, it fails to delve into how each interpretation aligns with the broader themes and context of Scripture, especially in understanding the significance of this passage in the larger biblical narrative. Connecting the interpretations to foundational principles of biblical interpretation would have strengthened the analysis."
