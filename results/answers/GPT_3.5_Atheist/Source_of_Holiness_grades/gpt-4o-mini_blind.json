However, there are some theological inaccuracies present. In a Christian-specific worldview, the process of becoming a saint is not based on personal achievements or good works, but rather on the justification and sanctification received through faith in Jesus Christ. Additionally, the distinction between the Catholic understanding of canonized saints and the Protestant belief in the priesthood of all believers could have been elaborated upon further for clarity."
