  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how believers become saints in Christian theology, acknowledging the diversity of beliefs among different denominations. However, the answer did not explicitly clarify the central role of faith in Jesus as the source of holiness, as highlighted in the concern. The reference answer emphasizes that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ, which was not clearly stated in the student's response."
