While it does not explicitly mention the saving work of Jesus Christ making believers holy, it is implicit in the statement that \"believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith.\" This aligns with the concern to clarify the source of holiness and reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in Christian doctrine. The response also provides some general information about the process of becoming a saint, including the varying approaches between different Christian denominations. Overall, the response is clear and concise, but could be strengthened by more explicit connections to biblical teachings and a clearer explanation of how believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ."
