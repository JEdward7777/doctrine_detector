## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Christian theology, the process of becoming a saint is typically understood as a recognition of someone's exceptional holiness, virtue, and dedication to God. Saints are often believed to have lived lives of great piety, performed miracles, and/or demonstrated remarkable acts of faith.

In some Christian denominations, individuals are formally declared saints through a canonization process, which involves a thorough examination of the person's life and the verification of any miracles attributed to them. This process is usually carried out by the leadership of the church, such as a pope or a council of bishops.

However, it's worth noting that the concept of saints can vary between different branches of Christianity. For example, in Protestantism, the emphasis is often placed on the belief that all believers are saints through their faith in Jesus Christ, rather than on the veneration of specific individuals as saints.

Ultimately, the idea of becoming a saint is rooted in the belief that through a life of faith and good works, individuals can achieve a special closeness to God and serve as examples for others to follow.
