  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a strong explanation of the Christian view that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ, highlighting the source of holiness as rooted in Christ's saving work rather than individual deeds. This reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in Christian doctrine, aligning well with the specified concern. The response could have further emphasized the importance of Christ's atonement in sanctification, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern within a Christian worldview."
