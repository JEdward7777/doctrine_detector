## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Christian theology, the process of becoming a saint is typically understood as a recognition of someone's exceptional holiness, virtue, and dedication to God. Saints are often believed to have lived lives of great piety, performed miracles, and/or demonstrated remarkable acts of faith.

In some Christian denominations, individuals are formally declared saints through a canonization process, which involves a thorough examination of the person's life and the verification of any miracles attributed to them. This process is usually carried out by the leadership of the church, such as a pope or a council of bishops.

However, it's worth noting that the concept of saints can vary between different branches of Christianity. For example, in Protestantism, the emphasis is often placed on the belief that all believers are saints through their faith in Jesus Christ, rather than on the veneration of specific individuals as saints.

Ultimately, the idea of becoming a saint is rooted in the belief that through a life of faith and good works, individuals can achieve a special closeness to God and serve as examples for others to follow.

Comment: The response provides a strong explanation of the Christian view that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ, highlighting the source of holiness as rooted in Christ's saving work rather than individual deeds. This reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in Christian doctrine, aligning well with the specified concern. The response could have further emphasized the importance of Christ's atonement in sanctification, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern within a Christian worldview.
