From a Christian worldview, demons are understood as fallen angels who seek to deceive and lead individuals away from the worship of the true God. The response lacks depth and fails to address the spiritual warfare aspect of idolatry and the Biblical teachings on the influence of demons in leading people astray. The answer is informative in a cultural context but lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective."
