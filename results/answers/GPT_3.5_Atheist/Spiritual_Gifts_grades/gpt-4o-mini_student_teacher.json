  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a general explanation of the concept of spiritual gifts in the Bible but fails to adequately address the concern about the importance of utilizing these gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. The student also introduces perspectives from culturally retributed and atheistic standpoints, which do not align well with a Christian worldview. There is some critical thinking demonstrated, but the answer lacks a clear focus on the significance of utilizing spiritual gifts for the edification of the church and obedience to the Holy Spirit."
