  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful analysis of the concept of spiritual gifts from both a Christian and an atheistic perspective. They provide a clear explanation of the biblical basis for spiritual gifts and acknowledge their social and hierarchical implications. Additionally, they offer a valid psychological interpretation of the phenomenon. However, the answer would benefit from a more explicit statement regarding the importance of spiritual gifts for personal obedience to the Holy Spirit and community growth, as per the specified concern."
