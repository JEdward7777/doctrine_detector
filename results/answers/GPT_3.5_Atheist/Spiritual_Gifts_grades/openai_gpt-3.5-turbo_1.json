The perspective on spiritual gifts from a culturally retributed standpoint and an atheistic standpoint is interesting but does not directly tie back to the Christian worldview emphasis on serving others in love and building up the church. The response could have been strengthened by exploring how the recognition and utilization of spiritual gifts are essential for fulfilling one's role within the Christian community and obeying the prompting of the Holy Spirit."
