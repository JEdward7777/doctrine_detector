  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The answer provided a good explanation of how confessing sins can lead to accountability and social restoration. However, it fell short in emphasizing the spiritual aspect of confession as highlighted in James 5:16. The student could have delved deeper into the idea of seeking forgiveness not just from others but ultimately from God, and how this process can bring about spiritual healing and reconciliation with Him. A stronger connection to the biblical context would have improved the grade."
