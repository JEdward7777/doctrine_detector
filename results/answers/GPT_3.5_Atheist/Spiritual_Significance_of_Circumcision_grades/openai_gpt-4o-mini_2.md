## [Answer](../Spiritual_Significance_of_Circumcision.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In a Christian context, the phrase "circumcision of the heart" symbolizes a spiritual transformation or purification of one's inner being. It is often used metaphorically to describe a person's sincere commitment to God, repentance of sin, and a genuine desire to live a righteous life. Just as physical circumcision involves the removal of the foreskin, symbolic circumcision of the heart involves cutting away spiritual impurities and worldly desires to become closer to God and live according to His will. This concept emphasizes the importance of inner purity and devotion in Christianity, rather than just outward acts of religious observance.
