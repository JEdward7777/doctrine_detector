## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Bible does indeed contain passages that prescribe stoning as a punishment for various offenses, including adultery. Leviticus 20:10 states, "If a man commits adultery with another man's wife...both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death." Similarly, in John 8:1-11, there is a story of a woman caught in adultery and brought to Jesus for judgment, where he famously says, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." 

From an atheistic scholarly perspective, it is important to recognize that the Bible was written in a particular historical and cultural context where such practices were not uncommon. The idea of punishment by stoning reflected the harshness of ancient Near Eastern legal codes, where severe consequences were imposed for breaking societal norms.

When considering the concept of stoning in relation to God's justice and mercy, it is crucial to acknowledge that these texts were written by human beings and are subject to interpretation and cultural bias. While some may argue that stoning was a means of upholding divine justice and deterring sin, others view it as a brutal and inhumane form of punishment that lacks mercy and compassion.

As an atheistic scholar, one may question the morality and ethics of using such drastic measures to address wrongdoings, especially when considering the disproportionate impact on marginalized individuals and the absence of a rehabilitative approach. It is essential to approach ancient texts with a critical and empathetic lens, recognizing the complexities of interpreting and applying religious laws in a modern and diverse society.
