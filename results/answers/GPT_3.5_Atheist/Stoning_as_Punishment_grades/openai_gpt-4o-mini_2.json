It appropriately contrasts the Old Testament prescription with the New Testament example of Jesus prioritizing mercy. The discussion of the historical and cultural context adds depth to the analysis. However, from a Christian worldview, it could have emphasized more strongly the importance of understanding God's justice and mercy as complementary aspects of His character rather than conflicting principles. Overall, a well-thought-out response demonstrating critical thinking."
