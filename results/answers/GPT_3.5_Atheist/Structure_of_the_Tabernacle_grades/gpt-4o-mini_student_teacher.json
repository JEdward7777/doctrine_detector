  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70.\n\nWhile the student correctly identifies the two main sections of the tabernacle and some of the items located within them, their answer includes additional details that are not directly related to the question. From a Christian perspective, understanding the significance of the components of the tabernacle in worship is essential for appreciating the spiritual and symbolic aspects of the worship practices in the Old Testament. The student's response provides some relevant information, but it could have been more focused on the worship significance."
