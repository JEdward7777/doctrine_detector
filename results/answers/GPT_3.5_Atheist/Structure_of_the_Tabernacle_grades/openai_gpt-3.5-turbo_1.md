## [Answer](../Structure_of_the_Tabernacle.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The tabernacle, as described in the Hebrew Bible, consisted of two main sections: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. In the Holy Place, there was the table of showbread, the golden lampstand, and the altar of incense. The Most Holy Place, also known as the Holy of Holies, housed the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments. These items were significant for the Israelites as they represented their covenant with their deity. From a scholarly perspective, the tabernacle is viewed as a central element in the ancient Israelite religious system, and the items within it served symbolic and ritual purposes for the community.
