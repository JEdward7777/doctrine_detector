However, it lacks depth in explaining the underlying theological significance of sacrificial offerings in the Old Testament and how they ultimately point to the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The answer could be improved by delving into the sacrificial system, the shedding of blood for the forgiveness of sins, and the fulfillment of these sacrifices in Christ as the perfect sacrificial Lamb."
