  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a decent explanation of the symbolism behind using a lamb for sacrifices and its connection to atonement. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the specific relationship between the innocent lamb being sacrificed to cover the sins of the guilty, as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, the response could have tied in the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb who atoned for the sins of humanity. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept, but there was room for more depth and clarity in their explanation."
