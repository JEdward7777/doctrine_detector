However, there could have been a clearer emphasis on the ultimate significance of the Lamb of God, Jesus Christ, as the ultimate sacrificial lamb who atones for the sins of humanity. More explicit reference to Christ's role in redemption through His sacrifice could have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective in the response."
