However, it lacked a direct mention of Christ as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb in the Christian faith, which is essential for a complete Christian worldview perspective on atonement and redemption. It would have been stronger if there was a clear reference to Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world."
