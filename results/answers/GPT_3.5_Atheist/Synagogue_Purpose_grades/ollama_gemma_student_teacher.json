It also acknowledges the importance of synagogues for communities living far from the Temple in Jerusalem. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the social and cultural significance of synagogues as community centers and cultural preservatories. Additionally, the answer could explicitly connect the use of synagogues to the broader context of Jewish worship practices and their connection to biblical traditions."
