However, the response lacks some depth in addressing the broader historical and religious significance of synagogues in Jewish worship, such as their role in preserving Jewish identity and culture during times of exile or oppression. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated, but a more comprehensive explanation would have improved the answer."
