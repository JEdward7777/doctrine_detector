  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed answer that accurately highlights the religious and cultural significance of the temple constructed by King Solomon in Jerusalem. However, there was a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer as the student included additional details about the temple's role in symbolizing unity and connection to heritage. While these aspects are indeed important, the primary purpose of the temple in the context of Old Testament worship was for prayer and sacrifices to God."
