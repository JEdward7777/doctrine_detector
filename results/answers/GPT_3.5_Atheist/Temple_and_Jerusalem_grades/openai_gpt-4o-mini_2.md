The term "Zion" has its origins in the ancient Hebrew Bible and was initially used to refer to the city of Jerusalem itself. Over time, Zion became symbolically linked to the location of the Temple in Jerusalem, which was considered the holiest site in Judaism.

The association of Zion with the Temple and its significance as a religious center grew as the Hebrew Bible and Jewish tradition developed. The Temple on Mount Zion was believed to be the earthly dwelling place of God and the site of important religious rituals and ceremonies. This association between Zion and the Temple became deeply ingrained in Jewish religious and cultural identity.
