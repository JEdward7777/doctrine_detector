## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, the concept of the temple as God's dwelling place is a central theme that is highlighted in multiple passages. For example, in 1 Kings 8:27, it is stated that "But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built!" This verse emphasizes the magnitude of God's presence and the limitations of a physical temple to contain Him.

Similarly, in the New Testament, the concept of the temple is reinterpreted in light of Jesus Christ. In John 2:19-21, Jesus declares, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The Gospel of John then clarifies that Jesus was speaking about the temple of His body. This signifies a shift from a physical building to the person of Jesus as the ultimate dwelling place of God among humanity.

Overall, both the Old and New Testaments convey the idea of the temple as God's dwelling place, but with a progression in understanding from a physical structure to a spiritual reality in Jesus Christ.
