  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: The answer provides a solid explanation of how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is expressed in both the Old and New Testaments. The student accurately references key passages such as 1 Kings 8:27 and John 2:19-21 to support their points. The progression from a physical temple to Jesus Christ as the ultimate dwelling place of God is well articulated. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
