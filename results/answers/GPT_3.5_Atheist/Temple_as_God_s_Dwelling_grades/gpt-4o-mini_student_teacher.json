  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting key verses and the shift from a physical building to the spiritual reality of Jesus Christ. However, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, such as the significance of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. Engaging with this aspect would have further enriched the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
