  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, incorporating both Old and New Testament perspectives. The use of relevant Bible verses strengthens the argument, but could benefit from more depth in analyzing the significance of believers as the \"temple of the Holy Spirit\" and how this impacts the Christian worldview. Overall, a well-rounded response with room for further expansion on the implications of this theological concept."
