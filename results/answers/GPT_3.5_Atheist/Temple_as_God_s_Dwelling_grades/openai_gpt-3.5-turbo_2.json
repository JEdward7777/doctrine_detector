  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explores the theological implications of God dwelling among His people by discussing the transition from the physical temple in the Old Testament to believers in Jesus being referred to as the 'temple of the Holy Spirit' in the New Testament. The student provides relevant biblical examples to support their analysis and demonstrates an understanding of the concept of God's dwelling place evolving from a physical structure to a spiritual reality in Jesus Christ. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern raised."
