However, the response could be improved by citing specific Biblical passages such as those found in Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13, which provide detailed accounts of the temptations and Jesus' responses. Additionally, incorporating theological insights on the significance of Jesus' victory over temptation for Christian doctrine and belief would enhance the depth of the explanation.
