  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately reflects Jesus' resistance to Satan's temptations, as described in the answer. It also provides some context by mentioning the specific temptations that Jesus faced and how he responded to them. Additionally, the response recognizes the significance of Jesus' obedience and commitment to God.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more depth and analysis of the concern. While it mentions that these stories serve as examples for Christians, it would be beneficial to further explore what this means in practical terms. For instance, how can Christians apply Jesus' example of resisting temptation in their own lives? What are some specific strategies or principles that can be learned from Jesus' story?\n\nOverall, the response is strong and provides a good foundation for understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation. With a bit more development and analysis, it could be even stronger."
