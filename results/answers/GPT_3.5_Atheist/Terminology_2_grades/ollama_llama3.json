  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nThe student has identified two terms used in Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper, which addresses the concern of understanding various terms used within Christianity. However, their response lacks depth and breadth, failing to provide a comprehensive overview of the different terms used across Christian traditions. The response also does not demonstrate an understanding of the significance or theological context behind these terms.\n\nThe student's response is limited to listing two terms without providing any explanation or analysis of their meanings, histories, or implications. This lack of depth and analysis reduces the value of the response and makes it difficult for readers to gain a nuanced understanding of the Lord's Supper in different Christian traditions."
