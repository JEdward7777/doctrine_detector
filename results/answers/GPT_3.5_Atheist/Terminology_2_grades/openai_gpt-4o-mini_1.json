The inclusion of terms such as Eucharist, Mass, Lord's Table, and Breaking of Bread demonstrates a strong understanding of the diversity of beliefs and practices surrounding this sacred practice in Christian communities. The only suggestion for improvement would be to delve deeper into the theological significance behind each term to further enhance the response."
