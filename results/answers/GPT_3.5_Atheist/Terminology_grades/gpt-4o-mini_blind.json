  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a variety of alternative terms that could be used to describe a deacon. However, from a Christian perspective, the terms could be more specifically related to the role and service of a deacon within the church. Terms like \"servant-leader,\" \"ministry assistant,\" or \"church minister\" would align more closely with the biblical understanding of a deacon's role as a servant in the church. The response could have been improved by incorporating terms that reflect the biblical and doctrinal aspects of the diaconate."
