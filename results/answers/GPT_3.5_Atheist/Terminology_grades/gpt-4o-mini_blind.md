Comment: The student provided a variety of alternative terms that could be used to describe a deacon. However, from a Christian perspective, the terms could be more specifically related to the role and service of a deacon within the church. Terms like "servant-leader," "ministry assistant," or "church minister" would align more closely with the biblical understanding of a deacon's role as a servant in the church. The response could have been improved by incorporating terms that reflect the biblical and doctrinal aspects of the diaconate.
