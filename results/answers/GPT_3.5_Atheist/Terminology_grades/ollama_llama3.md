85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 85.

The response does attempt to recognize the various ways to identify service roles within the church, which aligns with the concern. It provides seven alternative terms that can be used to describe a deacon, which shows an effort to acknowledge different perspectives and terminology.

However, while the response is somewhat relevant to the concern, it doesn't directly address or build upon the original answer about using terms like "church minister," "church worker," or "church servant" to describe a deacon. Instead, it presents a list of alternative terms that are not specifically tied back to the original answer.

To improve this response, I would suggest providing more explicit connections between the alternative terms and the original answer, demonstrating how these different perspectives can be used to further recognize and understand service roles within the church.
