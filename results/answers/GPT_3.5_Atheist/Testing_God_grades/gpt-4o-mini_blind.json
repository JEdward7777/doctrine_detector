  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of why it is considered wrong to put God to the test, drawing from both Christian and Islamic perspectives. The inclusion of relevant biblical and Quranic references enhances the doctrinal correctness of the answer. The student effectively communicates the idea that testing God reflects a lack of faith, respect, humility, and submission to His will. However, to improve the answer, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of testing God, such as questioning His sovereignty or demanding proofs beyond what He has already revealed. Additionally, integrating more detailed theological insights specific to Christian doctrine could enhance the overall depth and accuracy of the response."
