  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concern and provides relevant theological references from both Christianity and Islam to support their argument. They clearly explain the concept of not putting God to the test as a manifestation of humility, reverence, and trust in God's wisdom and plan. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific act of testing God mentioned in the reference answer, providing more context and examples."
