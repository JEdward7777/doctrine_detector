  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response correctly identifies that not putting God to the test involves trying to manipulate His power and mercy, which is in line with the concern about maintaining a proper relationship with God. The discussion of biblical passages from Matthew and Quranic references adds depth and authority to the response. The conclusion also accurately emphasizes the importance of humility and trust in God's plan.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by further developing the idea that testing God reflects a lack of faith and respect towards Him. For instance, it could explore how such behavior undermines the very foundation of our relationship with God. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the principle as crucial for maintaining a proper relationship with God, it could provide more specific examples or biblical teachings to support this assertion.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and its significance in Christian theology, but could benefit from further development and illustration."
