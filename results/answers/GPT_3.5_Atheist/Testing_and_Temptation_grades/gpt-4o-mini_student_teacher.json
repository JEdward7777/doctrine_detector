  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 85. \n\nThe student has correctly differentiated between testing and temptation in a biblical context, highlighting how testing is associated with God strengthening individuals through challenging situations, while temptation is linked to outside forces leading individuals away from God. The response demonstrates an understanding of the spiritual importance of discerning between the two concepts.\n\nThe student's answer provides a clear explanation but falls slightly short of the teacher's reference answer in terms of precision and depth. The reference answer specifically mentions that God does not initiate temptation, which is a crucial point in understanding the difference between testing and temptation in a Christian worldview. Overall, the student has shown a good comprehension of the topic, with some room for refinement in alignment with the reference answer for a higher grade."
