## [Answer](../Tetrarch_Role_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, Herod Antipas, also known as 'Herod the tetrarch,' is primarily known for his role in the trial and eventual execution of John the Baptist. According to the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, John the Baptist publicly criticized Herod Antipas for marrying his sister-in-law, Herodias, which was considered unlawful according to Jewish law. Herod Antipas then imprisoned John the Baptist, and eventually, at the request of Herodias' daughter Salome, he ordered John the Baptist to be beheaded.

Herod Antipas also plays a minor role in the trial of Jesus before his crucifixion. In the Gospel of Luke, when Pontius Pilate learns that Jesus is from Galilee, he sends him to Herod Antipas, who was in Jerusalem at the time. Herod Antipas questions Jesus, but eventually sends him back to Pilate without passing any judgment.

Overall, Herod Antipas is portrayed in the New Testament as a figure who succumbs to political pressures and personal desires, ultimately leading to the unjust execution of John the Baptist. His involvement in the trial of Jesus also highlights his role as a puppet ruler under Roman authority.
