However, it strays from the Christian worldview by including an atheistic interpretation. A focus on maintaining one's belief in Jesus Christ specifically would have been more in line with the question's context. Overall, while the response is informative, it lacks doctrinal correctness and can be confusing for readers seeking a Christian viewpoint."
