## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I approach this question from a historical and cultural perspective. According to the Christian tradition, before ascending to heaven, Jesus gave his disciples the Great Commission, instructing them to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he had commanded them (Matthew 28:19-20). This command is significant in Christian theology as it is seen as a call to spread the teachings of Jesus throughout the world.
