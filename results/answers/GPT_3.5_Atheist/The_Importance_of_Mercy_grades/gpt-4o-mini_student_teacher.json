  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 40. \n\nComment: The student's answer provides a reasonable explanation of the verse in James 2:13 from their atheistic perspective, focusing on reciprocity in human interactions. However, the interpretation lacks depth in connecting the principle of mercy with the implications for one's spiritual life from a Christian worldview, which was the specified concern in this case. The response does not delve into the importance of mercy in Christian conduct or its implications for spiritual growth as required."
