However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize that praying is specifically communicating with the one true God revealed in the Bible. The response could have included biblical references to support the distinction between praying to the God of Christianity versus praying to false gods. Additionally, the atheistic perspective presented lacks depth in addressing the spiritual aspects of prayer as understood by believers.Improvement can be made by incorporating more specifically Christian theological elements."
