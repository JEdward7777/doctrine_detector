  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the difference between prayer and talking to a false god. They accurately explain that prayer is a form of communication with a higher power, while talking to a false god is directed towards a deity that does not exist. The student's reasoning is well-reasoned and supported by relevant information from both an religious and an atheistic perspective."
