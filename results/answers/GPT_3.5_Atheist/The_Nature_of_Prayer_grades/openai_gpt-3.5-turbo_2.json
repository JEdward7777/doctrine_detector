  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively distinguishes between praying to God and praying to a false god by emphasizing the aspect of spiritual communion and true relationship with the divine. It aligns well with the concern on understanding the proper approach to prayer and differentiating it from false practices within a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be providing a bit more detail or Biblical references to support the distinction further. Great job overall!"
