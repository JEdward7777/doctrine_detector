  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The answer provides a good explanation of the concept of God writing His law on people's hearts in the New Covenant. It accurately conveys the idea of internalizing God's teachings and living them out genuinely. However, to improve the grade, the response could have further emphasized the role of the Holy Spirit in enabling this internal transformation and highlighted the connection to the forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ as central aspects of the New Covenant. Such additions would strengthen the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
