The concept of God writing his law on people's hearts in the New Covenant is a symbolic way of expressing the idea that following God's teachings will become an innate part of individuals' beliefs and values. This implies that rather than obeying out of fear or obligation, people will naturally and sincerely follow the principles of love, compassion, and justice that are at the core of God's moral code. It signifies a shift from external rules and rituals to an internal transformation and genuine understanding of what is right and wrong.
