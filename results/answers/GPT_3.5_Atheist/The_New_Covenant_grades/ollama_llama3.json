  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of God writing his law on people's hearts in the New Covenant, highlighting the shift from external rules to internal transformation. The phrase \"symbolic way of expressing\" shows an attempt to contextualize and explain the idea, which is relevant to the concern about grasping the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting this concept to the transformative relationship with God, as mentioned in the given answer. The phrase \"personal knowledge of Him\" and \"intrinsic motivation\" are key aspects that would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the idea of God's law being written on people's hearts, but could benefit from more explicit connections to the transformative nature of this relationship with God."
