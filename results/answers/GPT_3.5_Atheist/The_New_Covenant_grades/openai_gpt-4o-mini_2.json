  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of God internalizing His law in the New Covenant and the shift from external rules to internal transformation. The student's articulation of a transformative relationship with God and intrinsic motivation to follow His will align well with the Christian worldview. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on specific examples or scripture references to strengthen the argument within a Christian context."
