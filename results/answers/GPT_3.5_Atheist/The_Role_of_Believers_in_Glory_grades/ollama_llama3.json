  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning the hope and future promise of glory for believers, but it does not fully develop or elaborate on the concept of being glorified with Christ. While it touches on the idea that believers will be transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection, it does not explicitly connect this idea to the concept of sharing in His eternal glory.\n\nThe response also tends to focus more on a literal interpretation of being glorified with Christ, rather than exploring the metaphorical or symbolic aspects of this concept. Additionally, it could benefit from further biblical support and explanation to strengthen its argument.\n\nComment: While the response shows some understanding of the concept, it would be strengthened by providing more biblical context and exploring the various ways in which believers can experience glory through their faith, beyond just a literal resurrection."
