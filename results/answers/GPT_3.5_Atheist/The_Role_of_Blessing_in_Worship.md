## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The act of blessing is often seen as a way of invoking divine favor or protection upon someone or something. In religious contexts, blessing is typically associated with invoking the divine presence and seeking benefits from the deity or deities being praised. 

Praising God, on the other hand, is a way of expressing admiration, reverence, and gratitude towards the divine being. It involves acknowledging the greatness and goodness of God and can be done through prayer, song, or other forms of worship.

In this sense, while blessing and praising God are closely related in that they both involve a connection with the divine, blessing is more about seeking divine favor or protection, whereas praising God is about expressing reverence and gratitude.
