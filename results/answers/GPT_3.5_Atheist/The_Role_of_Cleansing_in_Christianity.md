## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible, often depicted through rituals such as purification ceremonies or sacrifices, symbolizes the removal of impurities or sins that separate individuals from God. In the New Testament, this concept is further developed through the teachings of Jesus Christ and the idea of redemption through his sacrifice.

Jesus taught that true cleansing and forgiveness of sins come not from following strict rituals or laws, but through repentance, faith, and a personal relationship with God. His death on the cross is seen as the ultimate sacrifice that cleanses believers of their sins and reconciles them with God.

In essence, the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible is transformed in the New Testament to emphasize the spiritual renewal and transformation of individuals through faith in Jesus Christ, rather than just external rituals or sacrifices. It is through this understanding of sin and redemption that believers are able to experience true cleansing and forgiveness in the eyes of God.
