  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid explanation of how the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible transitions into the New Testament teachings about sin and redemption through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The answer adequately addresses the transformative nature of cleansing from external rituals to inner renewal through faith in Christ. One point deduction for not explicitly mentioning the role of Jesus' blood in the cleansing of sins, as this is a crucial aspect in Christian doctrine regarding redemption."
