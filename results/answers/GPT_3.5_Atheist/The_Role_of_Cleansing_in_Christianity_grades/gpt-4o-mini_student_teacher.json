However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the direct relationship between Old Testament cleansing practices and New Testament teachings on sin and redemption, as highlighted in the reference answer. By drawing a clearer connection between the two, the student's response could better demonstrate how understanding the Old Testament practices deepens appreciation for Christ's redemptive work."
