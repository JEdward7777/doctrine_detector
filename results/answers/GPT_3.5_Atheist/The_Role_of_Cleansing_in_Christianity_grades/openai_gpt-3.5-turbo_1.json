The explanation is clear and coherent, demonstrating an understanding of the spiritual depth of the concept. The only slight deduction is due to not delving further into how understanding the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings deepens appreciation for Christ's redemptive work, which would have further strengthened the overall response."
