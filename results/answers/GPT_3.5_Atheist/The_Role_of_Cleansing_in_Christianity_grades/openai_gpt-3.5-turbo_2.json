The explanation regarding the transformation of the concept of 'cleansing' in the New Testament is clear and aligns well with Christian beliefs. The response could be further strengthened by incorporating more specific examples or references to Old Testament practices to illustrate the continuity and development of the concept throughout the Bible, in response to the concern provided. Overall, a strong understanding and articulation of the topic within a Christian worldview."
