## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Figures like Moses and King David were considered 'chosen ones' in the religious texts of Judaism because they were believed to have been selected by God for unique and important roles in the history of the Jewish people. This selection implied that God had a specific plan for these individuals and entrusted them with tasks such as leading the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt (Moses) or establishing a unified kingdom in Israel (King David).

The concept of being chosen by God implies that there is a divine selection process based on God's will and purposes. In the case of Moses and King David, it suggests that God saw qualities in these individuals that made them suitable for the tasks he had in store for them. This selection was not based on merit or personal qualities alone, but rather on God's sovereign choice.

From a cultural perspective, the idea of being chosen by God can also be seen as a reflection of the belief in a covenantal relationship between God and the Jewish people. By choosing certain individuals to fulfill specific roles, God was demonstrating his commitment to guiding and protecting his chosen people. This concept of chosenness has been a central aspect of Jewish identity and theology throughout history.
