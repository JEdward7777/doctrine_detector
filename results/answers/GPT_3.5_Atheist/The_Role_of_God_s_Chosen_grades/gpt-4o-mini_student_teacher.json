  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid understanding of how figures like Moses and King David were considered 'chosen ones' in Judaism, and how God's selection process is based on His will and purposes. The response effectively discusses the concept of being chosen by God and its implications for individuals and the community. However, the student's answer could have been more explicitly tied back to the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders within the Christian community. Encouraging the student to make more explicit connections to Christian theology and leadership principles would strengthen the response further."
