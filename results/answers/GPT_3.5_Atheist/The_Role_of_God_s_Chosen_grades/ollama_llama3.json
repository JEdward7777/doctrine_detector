It correctly emphasizes that God's selection was based on His divine purpose and plans for leadership among His followers. The response also touches on the idea that being chosen by God implies a covenantal relationship between God and His people.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more depth and biblical support for this concept. For example, it would have been helpful to explore specific passages from Scripture that demonstrate God's sovereignty in appointing leaders, such as Exodus 3:10-15 or Acts 13:1-3. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the implications of God's sovereignty for the Christian community, such as the importance of humility and trust in God's appointments.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a good starting point, it could benefit from further development and biblical grounding to fully explore the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders."
