The mention of the symbolic significance of the number twelve in Jewish tradition adds depth to the answer. However, to enhance the doctrinal accuracy, it could have included references to specific biblical passages where Jesus appoints the apostles and their individual roles within the group. Including specific examples would have strengthened the response further.
