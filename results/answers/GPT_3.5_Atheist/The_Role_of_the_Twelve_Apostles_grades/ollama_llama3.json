  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, highlighting their significance as Jesus' closest followers and their role in spreading His teachings after His ascension. The addition of the symbolic significance of the number twelve in Jewish tradition adds depth to the response and demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural context.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more concise and focused on the specific concern. While it provides a wealth of information, some of it may not directly address the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. A more targeted approach would strengthen the response and make it more effective at communicating this key point.\n\nComment: Overall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern. With some refinement to focus on the main point and eliminate any extraneous information, it could be even more compelling."
