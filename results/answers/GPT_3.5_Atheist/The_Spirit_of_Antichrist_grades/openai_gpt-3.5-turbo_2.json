The interpretation as a symbolic representation of ideologies challenging Christianity aligns with a secular perspective. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the concern of recognizing the spirit of antichrist for Christians to stay vigilant against deception, which is important from a Christian worldview perspective. A stronger emphasis on the spiritual warfare aspect and the importance of discernment in identifying deceptive ideologies would have enhanced the response."
