  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has accurately identified and explained two titles used in the Bible to refer to God as 'Almighty,' namely \"God Almighty\" (El Shaddai) and \"Lord of hosts\" (Yahweh Sabaoth). The explanation provided highlights the power, might, and sovereignty of God associated with these titles. However, incorporating scriptural references where these titles are used in the Bible would further strengthen the answer. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of recognizing God's attributes and power in our faith and relationship with Him would enhance the depth of the response. Overall, a solid explanation with room for improvement."
