  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided accurate information about the title \"Almighty\" used in the Bible with references to \"El Shaddai\" and \"Yahweh Sabaoth.\" However, the student missed mentioning some of the specific titles like 'Almighty God', 'Lord Almighty', and 'Lord God Almighty' as provided in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to be more comprehensive in their response to cover all the titles will enhance their understanding of God's character as portrayed in the Bible."
