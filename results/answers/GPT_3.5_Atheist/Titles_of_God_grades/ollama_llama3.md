In the Bible, the title "Almighty" is used to refer to God in several instances. One of the most well-known is "God Almighty," which is translated from the Hebrew term "El Shaddai." This title emphasizes God's power, might, and sovereignty over all things. 

Another title used in the Bible to refer to God as 'Almighty' is "Lord of hosts," which is translated from the Hebrew term "Yahweh Sabaoth." This title emphasizes God's authority and leadership over the heavenly armies and all creation.

It is important to note that these titles are significant in reflecting the attributes and power of God as portrayed in the Bible.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

The response does attempt to provide some information about titles that refer to God as "Almighty", although it is somewhat limited in its scope (only mentioning four specific titles). The response also acknowledges the importance of recognizing these titles in enhancing our understanding of God's character, which aligns with the concern provided.

However, the response could be improved by providing more biblical context and explanation about what these titles reveal about God's attributes and power. For example, the original response does a good job of highlighting the significance of "El Shaddai" and "Yahweh Sabaoth", but this information is not mentioned in the provided answer.

Overall, while the response shows some effort to engage with the concern, it could be more thorough and insightful in its exploration of God's character as revealed through these titles.
