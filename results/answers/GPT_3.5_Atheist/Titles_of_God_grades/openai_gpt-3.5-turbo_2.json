The mention of specific titles like 'Almighty God', 'God Almighty', 'Lord Almighty', and 'Lord God Almighty' aligns well with the concern of enhancing understanding of God's character through recognizing these titles. Great job in connecting the titles to the attributes and power of God as portrayed in the Bible."
