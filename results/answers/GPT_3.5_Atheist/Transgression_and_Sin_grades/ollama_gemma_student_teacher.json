  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the relationship between transgression, sin, and disobedience from a Christian perspective. The answer clearly explains the retributive consequences of transgression in both religious and cultural contexts. However, it could benefit from further elaboration on the theological aspects of sin and disobedience in Christian theology."
