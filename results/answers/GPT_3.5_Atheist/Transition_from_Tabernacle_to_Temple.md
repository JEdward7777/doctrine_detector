## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle because it was no longer relevant to their religious practices and beliefs. As society and religious customs evolved, the tabernacle lost its significance as a place of worship. The Israelites transitioned to more permanent structures such as the temple in Jerusalem, which better suited their spiritual needs and rituals. This change reflected a shift in the Israelites' religious traditions and cultural practices over time.
