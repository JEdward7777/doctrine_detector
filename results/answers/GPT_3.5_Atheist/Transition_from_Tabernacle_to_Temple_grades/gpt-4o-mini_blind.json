  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks doctrinal accuracy as it does not consider the biblical reasons for the transition from the tabernacle to the temple. The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle because God commanded King David to build the temple in Jerusalem (1 Chronicles 17:1-15) as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and for centralized worship. The shift was not simply due to societal or cultural changes but had a significant theological and divine purpose behind it. The answer would benefit from incorporating these biblical reasons for a more accurate explanation."
