However, the student's response lacks specificity and depth compared to the reference answer. It does not clearly explain the direct reason for the Israelites' shift from the tabernacle to the temple being the construction of the temple in Jerusalem by Solomon. The student's answer could be improved by providing a more explicit connection between the building of the temple and the cessation of the tabernacle's use in worship."
