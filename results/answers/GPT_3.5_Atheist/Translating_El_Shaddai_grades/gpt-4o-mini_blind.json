The examples given in Spanish, French, and German are appropriate. However, to improve the answer, the student could have also mentioned some other common translations in languages used in different regions globally. Additionally, integrating a brief explanation of the theological significance or connotations of the term \"El Shaddai\" in the Hebrew context would further enhance the response."
