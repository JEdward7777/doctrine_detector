Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of the translation of "El Shaddai" into different languages and acknowledges the importance of accurately representing God's name across cultures and languages. The mention of considering phonetics when deciding on the spelling in different languages is a good point. However, it would have been strengthened by further discussing the significance and attributes of God as "God Almighty" in the Christian faith, connecting the translation to theological principles.
