  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the nuances of translating \"fear\" in reference to God, including reverential fear, terrifying fear, and moral fear. They also recognize the importance of understanding these different translations in shaping one's perception of the divine-human relationship. However, the student could have emphasized more the significance of cultivating a proper attitude of deep respect, reverence, or awe towards God as the primary translation of \"fear,\" as indicated in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a solid response but could have aligned more closely with the Christian-specific worldview on the concept of fear in relation to God."
