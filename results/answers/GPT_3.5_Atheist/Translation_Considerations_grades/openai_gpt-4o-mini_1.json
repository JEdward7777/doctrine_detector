The answer aligns well with the concern of ensuring that translations adequately convey the original text's spiritual and cultural significance from a Christian perspective. The only minor improvement could be a direct reference to the theological implications of these terms within the Christian faith, but overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of maintaining these terms in translations."
