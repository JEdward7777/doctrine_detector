## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
When translating the phrase "image of God" when applied to humans, the Hebrew term "tzelem Elohim" is commonly used. The term "tzelem" conveys the idea of a representation or likeness, emphasizing that humans reflect or bear some similarity to God in their nature or attributes. This translation highlights the view in certain religious traditions that humans possess inherent dignity, worth, and a capacity for moral and spiritual reflection.

When applied to Jesus, the phrase "image of God" is often understood in a different light. In this context, the Greek term "eikṓn theoú" is frequently used, emphasizing that Jesus is the perfect representation or embodiment of God's nature and character. This translation underscores the belief in Jesus' divinity and his role as the ultimate revelation of God to humanity.

The significance of these translations lies in the theological implications they carry. When humans are described as the "image of God," it emphasizes their special status in creation and their moral responsibility to reflect God's character in their lives. On the other hand, when Jesus is referred to as the "image of God," it highlights his unique role in salvation history and his identity as the Son of God. Overall, these translations help to convey the profound theological truths about the nature of humanity and the person of Jesus in different cultural and religious contexts.
