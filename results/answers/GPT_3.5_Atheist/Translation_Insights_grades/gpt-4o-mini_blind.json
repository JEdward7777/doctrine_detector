  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a solid explanation of the translations of \"image of God\" when applied to humans and Jesus, highlighting the theological significance of each term. The student effectively contrasts the Hebrew term \"tzelem Elohim\" used for humans with the Greek term \"eik\u1e53n theo\u00fa\" used for Jesus, and articulates their respective theological implications. However, the response could have been strengthened by incorporating more direct references to specific biblical passages that support these translations and their significance in Christian doctrine. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the implications of Jesus being the perfect image of God could have enhanced the theological depth of the analysis."
