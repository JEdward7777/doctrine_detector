  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. The student demonstrated good understanding of the translations for \"image of God\" when applied to humans and Jesus, expounded on the theological implications, and connected them to different cultural and religious contexts. However, the student's answer lacked specific suggested translations as provided in the reference answer from the teacher. Encouraging more precise language and alignment with the specific translations would have improved the overall answer."
