  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the translations of the phrase \"image of God\" when applied to humans and Jesus, showing an understanding of the theological implications involved. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a good grasp of the theological significance of translation in understanding biblical teachings from a Christian worldview. The response could have been enhanced by directly addressing the concern raised about the implications of translation, but overall, it effectively conveys the Christian perspective on the concept of the \"image of God\" in humans and in Jesus."
