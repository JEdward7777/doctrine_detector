  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided some good alternative translations for the phrase 'to be zealous' that reflect its biblical meaning such as 'to be fervent', 'to be enthusiastic', and 'to be ardent'. However, the answer could be improved by incorporating more specific references to biblical passages or examples where these alternative translations are used to convey zeal. Additionally, emphasizing the spiritual or religious aspect of zeal in the biblical context would enhance the overall response."
