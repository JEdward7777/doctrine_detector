  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful alternative translations for the phrase 'to be zealous' that align well with its biblical meaning by emphasizing intensity, passion, and commitment. However, the student's response could have been improved by incorporating some of the teacher's provided translations, such as 'be strongly diligent,' to further enrich the understanding of the biblical concept of zeal."
