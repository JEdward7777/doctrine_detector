  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides some alternative translations for \"to be zealous\" that reflect its biblical meaning, which aligns with the concern of understanding the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith. The examples provided, such as \"to be fervent\", \"to be enthusiastic\", and \"to be ardent\", do convey a sense of intense passion and dedication.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger if it directly addressed the concern and explicitly connected the alternative translations to the importance of zeal in the Christian faith. Additionally, while the examples provided are good, they are not entirely novel or surprising, as similar alternatives were already suggested in the original answer.\n\nComment: While this response provides some helpful alternative translations, it could be more effective if it more clearly addressed the concern and added more depth or nuance to its explanations."
