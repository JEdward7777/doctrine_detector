The suggestions of 'fervent,' 'enthusiastic,' and 'ardent' effectively convey the depth of commitment expected in the Christian faith. However, additional biblical references or examples illustrating the significance of zeal in Christian doctrine could further strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
