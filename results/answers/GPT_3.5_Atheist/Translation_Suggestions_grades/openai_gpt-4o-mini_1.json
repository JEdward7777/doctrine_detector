  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides thoughtful and relevant alternative translations for the phrase 'to be zealous' that reflect the biblical meaning well. The suggestions of 'fervent,' 'enthusiastic,' and 'ardent' effectively capture the intensity and passion associated with zeal in the Bible, aligning with the concern regarding understanding the depth of commitment expected in the Christian faith. The response could be further enhanced by explicitly connecting the alternative translations to specific biblical passages or examples to strengthen the argument from a Christian worldview perspective."
