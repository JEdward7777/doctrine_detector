The alternatives presented - 'to be fervent', 'to be enthusiastic', and 'to be ardent' - reflect a deep understanding of the biblical concept of zeal and its importance in Christian faith. The response demonstrates a nuanced appreciation for the significance of translations in capturing the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian worldview. Well done!"
