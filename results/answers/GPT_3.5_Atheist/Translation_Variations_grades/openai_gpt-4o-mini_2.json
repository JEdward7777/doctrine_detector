Instead, they focus more on general concepts of reciprocity, loyalty, and commitment without emphasizing the divine aspect of God's faithful love and dependability. In a Christian context, it is essential to highlight the divine and sacrificial nature of covenant faithfulness to deepen understanding from a biblical perspective."
