  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of how the translation of \"Lord\" can differ in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people. They acknowledged the nuanced meanings and connotations associated with the term in various settings. However, they did not specifically address the importance of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms in relation to understanding scripture and the nature of God, which is a key concern. Therefore, the grade is slightly lower."
