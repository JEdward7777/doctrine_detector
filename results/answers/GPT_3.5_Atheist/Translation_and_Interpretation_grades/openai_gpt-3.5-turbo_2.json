  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the significance of capitalizing \"Lord\" when referring to God and correctly acknowledges that it may be translated differently when referring to other authorities or individuals. The understanding conveyed aligns well with the concern that proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impact the understanding of scripture and the nature of God from a Christian perspective. The response effectively communicates how the translation of \"Lord\" can vary depending on the context while maintaining a focus on the importance of accurately representing God's divine attributes."
