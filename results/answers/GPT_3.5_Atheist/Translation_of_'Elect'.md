## Question [Translation of 'Elect'](../../questions/Translation_of_'Elect'.md)
In what ways does the translation of 'elect' differ in older and modern English Bible versions, and what impact does this have on understanding Scripture?

## Target answer from notes
Older Bible versions use 'elect' in both the Old and New Testaments, while modern versions often use 'chosen ones' in the Old Testament and 'elect' primarily in the New Testament, which may affect the reader's understanding of their identity as God's people.

## Concern to grade by
Clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God.

## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In older English Bible versions, such as the King James Version, the term "elect" is used to refer to those chosen or selected by God for salvation or for a specific purpose. In modern English Bible versions, the term "chosen" is often used instead of "elect" to convey a similar meaning.

The impact of this change in translation is primarily seen in how the concept of God's choosing or selecting individuals is understood by readers. The term "elect" may carry with it a sense of exclusivity or special privilege, indicating a predestined group of people chosen by God. On the other hand, the term "chosen" may be perceived as more inclusive and accessible, suggesting that anyone can be chosen by God.

Ultimately, the translation of "elect" versus "chosen" does not significantly change the core theological concepts found in Scripture regarding God's sovereignty and human free will. However, it can influence how individuals interpret and apply the idea of being chosen by God in their own lives.
