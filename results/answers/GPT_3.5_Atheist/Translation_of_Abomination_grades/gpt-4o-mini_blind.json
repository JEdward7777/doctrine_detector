The translations suggested, \"something utterly despicable\" or \"an act deserving of strong revulsion,\" accurately capture the severity and strong moral judgment inherent in the term. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning the biblical usage and context of \"abomination\" to further solidify the connection to religious teachings."
