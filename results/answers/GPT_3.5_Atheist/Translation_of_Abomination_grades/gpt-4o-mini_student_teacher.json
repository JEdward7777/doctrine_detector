  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a thoughtful and well-explained response that conveys the severity and moral judgment associated with the term \"abomination,\" they could have more explicitly connected the translation to the biblical context and God's laws. The teacher's reference answer offers more direct and explicitly biblical translations that align closely with a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to make stronger connections to biblical teachings and accuracy in translation would improve their answer."
