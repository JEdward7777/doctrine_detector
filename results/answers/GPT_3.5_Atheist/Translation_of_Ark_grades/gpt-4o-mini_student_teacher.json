  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a good explanation of the term \"ark\" in different Biblical contexts, accurately mentioning the Ark of the Covenant and Noah's Ark, their answer could be improved by providing more examples and specifics to enhance the depth of understanding. The teacher's reference answer offered a more concise and comprehensive explanation, which the student could strive to emulate in future responses."
