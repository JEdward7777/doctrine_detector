## [Answer](../Translation_of_Begotten.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the context of spiritual rebirth, the term "begotten" can be understood metaphorically as a process of transformation or renewal. Just as a parent begets a child, spiritual rebirth involves a profound change or "birth" of the self at a spiritual level. This can be seen as a metaphorical representation of shedding old beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes in order to embrace a new way of living, guided by spiritual principles and values.

In this sense, spiritual rebirth is not a literal physical birth, but rather a symbolic or metaphysical awakening to a new way of being. It represents a fresh start, a new beginning, and a reorientation of one's thoughts, actions, and priorities towards a more enlightened and fulfilling existence.

It is important to note that the concept of spiritual rebirth can be interpreted and understood in various ways across different religious and philosophical traditions. Each tradition brings its own unique perspective on the process of transformation and renewal, and individuals are encouraged to explore and reflect on what spiritual rebirth means to them personally.
