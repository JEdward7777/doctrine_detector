However, the response could have further emphasized the unique Christian perspective on being \"begotten\" and how it specifically relates to believers in Christ. More direct references to biblical teachings on spiritual rebirth and the significance of being \"begotten\" in Christian theology would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
