  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided some creative translations for the term 'church' that attempt to capture its essence, there is a lack of emphasis on the theological significance and biblical foundation of the term. A Christian-specific worldview would prioritize terms that convey the biblical understanding of the church as the body of Christ, the bride of Christ, or the assembly of believers gathered in His name. Incorporating these fundamental aspects would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
