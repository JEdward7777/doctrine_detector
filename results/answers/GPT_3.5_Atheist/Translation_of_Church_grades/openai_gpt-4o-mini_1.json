  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides accurate and relevant suggestions for translating the term 'church' into a culturally retributed context while specifically addressing the concern of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature. The emphasis on terms like 'gathering together', 'assembly', or 'congregation' is commendable as it highlights the inclusivity of all believers coming together, rather than focusing on specific groups. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern provided."
