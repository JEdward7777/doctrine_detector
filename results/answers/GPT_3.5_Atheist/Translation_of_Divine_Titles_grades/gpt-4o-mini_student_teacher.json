  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of maintaining the meaning of the term \"Lord Yahweh\" in different languages. They appropriately suggested translations like \"Lord God\" or \"God Yahweh\" to convey the concept effectively. However, the teacher's reference answer provided a more precise translation option with 'Lord God' or 'God who is the Lord,' emphasizing the importance of considering the grammatical structure in the target language, which the student did not address explicitly. Overall, the student's response is insightful and demonstrates a solid foundation in understanding the significance of accurate translation in conveying God's titles and presence in Scripture."
