  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and well-supported evaluation of translation options for the terms \"Hades\" and \"Sheol\" in the Bible, considering their cultural and theological implications. The suggested translations align well with accurate biblical representation to enhance understanding among believers. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of explicit reference to the importance of maintaining the theological significance and implications of the terms in the translations. Overall, it demonstrates a strong consideration of the concern provided."
