  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough answer with various translations in different languages, showing an understanding of conveying religious or spiritual connotations. However, the concern was to ensure accurate representation of the term in translations to maintain the theological implications, which the student's answer lacked. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes retaining the meaning of holiness, often implying 'God' or 'the Set Apart One,' which the student did not fully capture in their response."
