  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the importance of considering cultural and historical connotations when translating the term \"Rabbi\" into various languages. The student correctly emphasizes the need to convey both the literal meaning and the reverence associated with the title. The suggestion to retain the term \"Rabbi\" in languages with a Christian heritage is appropriate to maintain its specific Jewish context. The recommendation to use descriptive phrases in languages lacking a direct equivalent demonstrates thoughtful consideration. Overall, the answer shows a good grasp of the topic with room for minor improvements in depth and clarity."
