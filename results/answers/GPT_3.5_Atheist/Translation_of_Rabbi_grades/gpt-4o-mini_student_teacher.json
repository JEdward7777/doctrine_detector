  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful answer that demonstrates an understanding of the importance of cultural and historical connotations when translating the term \"Rabbi.\" They also correctly emphasized the need to convey the reverence and authority associated with the title. However, the student could have enhanced their answer by explicitly addressing the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith, as mentioned in the reference answer. By incorporating this specific Christian worldview perspective, the student's response would have been more complete and aligned with the given concern."
