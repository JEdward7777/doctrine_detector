It appropriately emphasizes the importance of conveying the reverence and authority associated with the title while ensuring that it aligns with how teachers are typically addressed in different languages. The response could have strengthened its Christian perspective by explicitly highlighting the unique role of Jesus as the ultimate teacher and leader within Christianity."
