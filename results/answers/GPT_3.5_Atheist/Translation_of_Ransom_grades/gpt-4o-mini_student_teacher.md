## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 80. While the student provided accurate translations of the term 'ransom' in various languages, they did not emphasize the theological significance of the term as much as they could have. The reference answer from the teacher highlights the importance of emphasizing the action of making a payment to secure freedom, which is crucial in a theological context. The student's response could have been improved by discussing the theological implications of 'ransom' in different languages.
