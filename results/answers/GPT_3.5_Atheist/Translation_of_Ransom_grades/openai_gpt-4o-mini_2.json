The explanation of 'ransom' as \"pay to release,\" \"buy back,\" or \"penalty paid\" aligns with the Christian understanding of ransom as a payment made for securing freedom, ensuring theological accuracy across contexts. This demonstrates a strong grasp of the concern for ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural boundaries."
