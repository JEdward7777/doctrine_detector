Grade: 60

Comment: The student's answer provides accurate translations of the phrase "Your Majesty" in different languages, which is commendable. However, the concern specified the importance of ensuring accurate and respectful translations of titles in the context of biblical teachings. The teacher's reference answer suggests using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency' to maintain respect and reverence when translating titles in a biblical context, which the student's answer does not incorporate. The student should have also considered the appropriate level of formality and honorifics in the translations, aligning with biblical teachings on respect and honor towards authority figures. Thus, the student's answer, while informative, could be improved by focusing more on maintaining biblical principles in translations.
