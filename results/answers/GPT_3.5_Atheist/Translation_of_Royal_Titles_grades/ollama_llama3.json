However, it does not directly address the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations of titles in the context of biblical teachings. Additionally, the provided answer is not entirely accurate, as it suggests that \"your Highness,\" \"your Excellency,\" or a natural way of addressing a ruler are all equivalent to \"Your Majesty.\" While these phrases may show respect, they do not necessarily convey the same level of reverence and majesty as \"Your Majesty.\"\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more context on the biblical teachings surrounding titles and honorifics, and to offer more specific and accurate translations that align with those teachings."
