  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, demonstrating an understanding of the importance of respect and reverence towards royalty or a monarch. However, there is a lack of direct integration of biblical teachings in relation to accurate and respectful translations of titles. The response could be improved by explicitly connecting the translations provided to biblical teachings on honoring authority and showing respect."
