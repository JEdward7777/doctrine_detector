However, from a Christian worldview, the reference answer of 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus' more accurately captures the essence of the term 'saints' within the Christian faith. The student's attempt to be respectful of different beliefs is commendable, but in this context, it is essential to retain the religious significance associated with the term 'saints' within Christianity."
