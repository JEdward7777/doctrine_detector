  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge the importance of avoiding specific religious connotations, it falls short in providing more inclusive language options that accurately represent all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The suggested translations (\"esteemed individuals,\" \"honored figures\") are more general and do not specifically reference Jesus or Christianity, which aligns with the concern.\n\nThe provided answer, on the other hand, does include specific references to Christian groups, which may not be inclusive of all believers in Jesus. A higher grade would require a response that provides more creative and inclusive translation options that are respectful of different cultural backgrounds while still accurately representing all believers in Jesus."
