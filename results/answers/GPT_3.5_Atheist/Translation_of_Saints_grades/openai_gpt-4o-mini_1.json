  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of accurately representing believers in Jesus, but it falls short of providing a translation that is fully inclusive of all believers without specific Christian connotations. The suggested translations still carry religious connotations and do not address the concern raised. More effort is needed to align the translation with the concern provided."
