## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Translating the term "saints" can be a bit challenging, as it carries religious connotations in many cultures. One culturally respectful way to translate it could be to use the term "esteemed individuals" or "honored figures" depending on the context. This translation maintains the sense of reverence and respect while avoiding specific religious connotations.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of accurately representing believers in Jesus, but it falls short of providing a translation that is fully inclusive of all believers without specific Christian connotations. The suggested translations still carry religious connotations and do not address the concern raised. More effort is needed to align the translation with the concern provided.
