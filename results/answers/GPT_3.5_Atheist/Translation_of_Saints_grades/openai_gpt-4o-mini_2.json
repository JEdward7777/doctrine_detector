  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response correctly offers translations for \"saints\" that align with Christian beliefs, such as \"holy ones\" and \"holy believers in Jesus\". However, it could be improved by considering the concern of using inclusive language to accurately represent all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. It does not address the concern raised in the prompt."
