The student does a good job of discussing the importance of considering the cultural and historical connotations associated with the term 'sanctuary' when translating it in modern texts. They emphasize the need to accurately convey the significance of the term in the target language and address potential misunderstandings that may arise. 

To improve, the student could have further emphasized the theological implications of 'sanctuary' in Christian contexts, such as its significance in the Old Testament as a place of refuge and holiness, and in the New Testament as a symbol of Christ's redemptive work. Additionally, discussing the Biblical framework of sanctuary and its implications for translation could have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
