  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the term 'sanctuary' in modern contexts and highlights the importance of capturing its cultural significance and historical weight. However, the main concern raised in the reference answer is not directly addressed, which is ensuring the accurate reflection of the Biblical definition of 'sanctuary' in translations. The student's response lacks a specific focus on the Biblical aspect of the term, leading to a deduction in the grade."
