  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the importance of accurately translating the term 'sanctuary' to reflect its Biblical definition as a holy and sacred place. It addresses the concern of maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms effectively and emphasizes the significance of cultural context in translation. The response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the religious implications of 'sanctuary' in a Christian-specific worldview."
