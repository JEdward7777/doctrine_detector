It addresses the concern of ensuring proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms well. The response could have further delved into how to specifically ensure the Biblical definition is preserved during translation, but overall, it demonstrates a strong consideration of maintaining the original meaning of the term 'sanctuary' in a Christian context."
