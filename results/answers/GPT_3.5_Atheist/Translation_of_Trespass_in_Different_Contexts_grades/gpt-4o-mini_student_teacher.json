  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the implications of translating \"trespass\" as \"sin\" or \"breaking the rule\" within a church community. They effectively discussed how each translation choice can influence the perception and response to inter-personal violations. The response provided insight into the importance of considering cultural and religious contexts in selecting translations. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern regarding ensuring alignment with scriptural integrity and community values. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful analysis."
