  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and culturally sensitive translation for the phrase \"house of Yahweh.\" They have conveyed the importance of worship spaces and highlighted the religious significance associated with the term. However, the teacher's reference answer more directly emphasizes the presence of Yahweh in that location, which is a key aspect of understanding the phrase's significance in the context of worship. The student could improve by placing a stronger emphasis on Yahweh's presence in their translation."
