The concern about accurate translations conveying the meaning and importance of worship spaces is addressed well. However, the response could have further integrated a Christian worldview perspective to emphasize the sacredness and significance of worship spaces within the context of Christian belief. This would have enhanced the response and provided a deeper understanding of the phrase from a Christian perspective.
