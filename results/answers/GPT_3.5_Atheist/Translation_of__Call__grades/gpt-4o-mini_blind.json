  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 85.\n\nThe student has done a good job in providing alternative translations of the phrase \"You must call his name\" in a biblical context. The translations offered reflect a sense of duty or obligation similar to the original phrase, capturing its essence effectively. Additionally, the student has maintained a formal and ceremonial tone in line with biblical language. However, to improve this response, the student could have explicitly incorporated more Christian theological concepts or language to enhance the biblical context. Overall, a solid effort with room for further theological depth."
