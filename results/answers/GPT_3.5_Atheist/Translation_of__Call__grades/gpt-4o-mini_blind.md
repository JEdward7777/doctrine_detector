In a culturally retributed context, alternative translations of the phrase "You must call his name" in a biblical context could include:

1. "You are required to invoke his name"
2. "You shall proclaim his name"
3. "It is necessary for you to utter his name"

The student has done a good job in providing alternative translations of the phrase "You must call his name" in a biblical context. The translations offered reflect a sense of duty or obligation similar to the original phrase, capturing its essence effectively. Additionally, the student has maintained a formal and ceremonial tone in line with biblical language. However, to improve this response, the student could have explicitly incorporated more Christian theological concepts or language to enhance the biblical context. Overall, a solid effort with room for further theological depth.
