  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The provided response offers a valid alternative translation that focuses on the act of naming. While the student's response does not directly address the nuances of biblical language and interpretation, the explanation is coherent and demonstrates an understanding of the broader concept of naming in a biblical context. Deducting a few points for not directly engaging with the concern raised, but overall a solid effort."
