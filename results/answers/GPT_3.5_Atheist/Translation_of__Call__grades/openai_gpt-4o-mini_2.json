  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The provided response offers a valid alternative translation that emphasizes the act of naming, which can deepen the understanding of the biblical context. However, the response does not engage with the nuances of biblical language as deeply as some of the alternative translations that were presented in the original response. It could be enhanced by further exploration of how biblical language shapes interpretation."
