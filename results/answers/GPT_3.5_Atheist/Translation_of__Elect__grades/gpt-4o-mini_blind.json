However, the response could have been improved by delving deeper into the theological implications of the specific term \"elect,\" such as its relation to the doctrine of election and predestination according to Christian beliefs. Additionally, incorporating specific biblical references or examples could have strengthened the argument and provided a more robust theological analysis."
