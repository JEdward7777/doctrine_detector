  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed answer that demonstrates an understanding of the topic at hand. They accurately describe the difference in translation of 'elect' in older and modern English Bible versions and the potential impact on understanding Scripture. However, the student's answer lacks the specific distinction between the usage of 'elect' in the Old and New Testaments as outlined in the reference answer. Incorporating this detail would have strengthened the response and provided a more comprehensive analysis."
