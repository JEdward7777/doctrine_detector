  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the difference between the translations of \"elect\" and \"chosen\" in older and modern English Bible versions. They also effectively explain the potential impact of this difference on readers' understanding of God's choosing or selecting individuals. The response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer and provides a thoughtful analysis of the theological implications of these translational variations."
