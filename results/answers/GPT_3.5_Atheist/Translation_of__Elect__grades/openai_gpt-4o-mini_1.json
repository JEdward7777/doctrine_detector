The response effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God. The only area for improvement would be to integrate more explicitly a Christian worldview perspective, such as emphasizing God's sovereignty and the theological significance of being chosen by God in salvation."
