  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively explains the cultural and historical reasons behind the preference for using 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' in translations. They demonstrate an understanding of the respect and reverence associated with the divine name and how maintaining traditional practices can preserve the holiness of the text. However, the student could strengthen the answer by explicitly addressing the concern raised about the importance of using the original names of God versus cultural practices. Additionally, they could further elaborate on how this preference ties into Christian specific beliefs and interpretations."
