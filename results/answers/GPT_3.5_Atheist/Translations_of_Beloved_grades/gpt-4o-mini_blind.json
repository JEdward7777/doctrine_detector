The terms mentioned convey a sense of deep affection and emotional attachment, aligning well with the concept of 'beloved'. However, for a Christian-specific worldview, it would be beneficial to include terms that emphasize the sacrificial, selfless love exemplified in the biblical understanding of love, such as 'beloved in Christ' or 'beloved by God'. Including these theological nuances would enhance the response even further."
