However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it could have emphasized more on the deeper spiritual connotations of the term 'beloved' in the Bible, such as God's unconditional love for His people and the special relationship believers have with Him as His beloved children. Adding these spiritual dimensions would have enhanced the interpretation of biblical texts and relationships within the Christian faith."
