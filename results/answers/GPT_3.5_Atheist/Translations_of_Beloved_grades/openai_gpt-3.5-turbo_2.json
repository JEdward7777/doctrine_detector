However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to consider the significance of the term 'beloved' in the Bible, where it often refers to God's love for His people or Jesus being referred to as the beloved Son. Connecting these translation suggestions to the deeper theological meaning of 'beloved' in the Christian faith would have enhanced the interpretation of biblical texts further."
