  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the cultural differences between worshiping God and worshiping false gods. However, it lacks specific reference to the Christian worldview or the biblical perspective on true worship. To enhance the grade, the student should have emphasized the importance of aligning worship practices with the teachings and beliefs of Christianity, particularly emphasizing the centrality of Jesus Christ as the one true God."
