  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: This answer, while providing some insightful points, falls short from a Christian worldview perspective. It fails to address key biblical criteria for distinguishing between true and false prophets, such as aligning with God's word (Deuteronomy 13:1-4), accurate prophecy (Deuteronomy 18:22), and leading people towards God, not away from Him (1 John 4:1). The answer also relies heavily on subjective criteria rather than the objective standards laid out in the Bible. Encouraging the student to integrate Scriptural principles in their evaluation of prophets would strengthen their answer."
