However, their approach lacks a specific focus on aligning the messages with God's Word and the nature of teachings, which are crucial aspects when evaluating prophetic voices from a Christian worldview. The answer also falls short in emphasizing the spiritual discernment aspect and the importance of testing the spirits against biblical truths."
