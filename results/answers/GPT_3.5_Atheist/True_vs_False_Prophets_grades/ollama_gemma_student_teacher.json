  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in discerning true prophets from false ones. The student correctly points out the importance of examining the impact and consequences of teachings, as well as considering the motivations and historical contexts of individuals claiming to be prophets. However, the answer lacks a specifically theological or biblical basis for distinguishing between true and false prophets, which aligns with the student's atheist perspective. While the answer is well-reasoned and provides valuable insights from a cultural and historical standpoint, it does not fully address the Christian-specific concern of discerning true prophetic voices from those that mislead or misrepresent God's messages."
