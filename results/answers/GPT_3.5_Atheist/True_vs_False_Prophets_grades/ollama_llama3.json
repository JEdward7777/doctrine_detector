  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does attempt to address the concern by providing some criteria for distinguishing between true prophets and false ones, such as examining the impact and consequences of their teachings, looking at their historical context and motivations, and critically analyzing their teachings and actions. However, these criteria are not necessarily rooted in a Christian worldview or biblical principles, which is reflected in the answer.\n\nIn particular, the response does not explicitly consider the importance of aligning one's teachings with God's Word, which is a crucial aspect of discerning true prophetic voices according to the provided answer. Additionally, while the response mentions that false prophets may spread messages of hatred and violence, it does not provide any specific examples or warnings about how these types of messages can be harmful.\n\nOverall, while the response attempts to address the concern, it could benefit from a more explicit consideration of Christian principles and biblical teachings in its analysis."
