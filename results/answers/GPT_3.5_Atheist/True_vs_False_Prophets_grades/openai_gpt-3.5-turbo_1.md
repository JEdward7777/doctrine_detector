## [Answer](../True_vs_False_Prophets.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I approach this question from a cultural and historical perspective rather than a religious one. Throughout history, various cultures have had individuals who claimed to be prophets or have been seen as such by their followers. 

One way to distinguish between a true prophet and a false prophet is to examine the impact and consequences of their teachings. A true prophet would likely promote messages of peace, love, and acceptance, while a false prophet may spread messages of hatred, discrimination, or violence.

Additionally, looking at the historical context and the motivations of the individual can also provide clues. True prophets often come from humble backgrounds and seek to improve the lives of others, while false prophets may seek power, wealth, or control over others.

Ultimately, the distinction between a true prophet and a false prophet is subjective and can vary depending on one's beliefs and cultural background. It is important to critically analyze the teachings and actions of individuals claiming to be prophets before accepting them as such.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis on distinguishing true prophetic voices based on examining if the messages align with God's Word, the nature of their teachings, and the fruits of their ministry. It acknowledges the importance of aligning teachings with a divine standard. However, the response falls short of explicitly incorporating a Christian worldview in evaluating prophets, as it does not directly reference God's messages or the biblical criteria for discerning true prophets. Nonetheless, the response shows critical thinking and consideration of the concern raised.
