However, it falls short of emphasizing the central role of God's truth and revelation in distinguishing true prophets from false ones within a Christian worldview. There is a strong consideration of the impact and consequences of teachings, but lacking a direct reference to the ultimate standard of God's Word may lead to ambiguity or relativism in discerning true prophets."
