## Concern to grade by
Distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking.

## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a cultural perspective, having hope in God typically involves belief in a higher power who can bring about positive outcomes or provide comfort and guidance in difficult times. This hope is often based on faith and trust in the divine, which can bring a sense of purpose and meaning to one's life.

On the other hand, merely wishing for something is more of a desire or longing for a specific outcome or situation, without necessarily attributing it to a higher power or external force. Wishing is often more passive and does not necessarily involve a sense of belief or expectation that the desired outcome will come to fruition.

In essence, having hope in God can offer a deeper sense of connection and reassurance, while wishing for something may lack the same level of conviction and faith.
