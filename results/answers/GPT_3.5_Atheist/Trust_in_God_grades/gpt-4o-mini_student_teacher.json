  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a decent explanation of the difference between hoping in God and merely wishing for something from a cultural perspective. They touch on key points such as belief in a higher power, faith, trust, and the passive nature of wishing. However, the student's answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of a confident trust in God's faithfulness and fulfillment of promises, as outlined in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to focus more on the aspect of confident expectation in God's character would strengthen their response from a Christian worldview."
