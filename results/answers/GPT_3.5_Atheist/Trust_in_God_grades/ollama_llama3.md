## Question [Trust in God](../../../questions/Trust_in_God.md)
How does having hope in God differ from merely wishing for something?

## Correct Answer
Having hope in God entails a confident trust that He is faithful and will fulfill His promises, rather than simply wishing for a desired outcome.

## Stated Concern
Distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking.

## [Answer](../Trust_in_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From a cultural perspective, having hope in God typically involves belief in a higher power who can bring about positive outcomes or provide comfort and guidance in difficult times. This hope is often based on faith and trust in the divine, which can bring a sense of purpose and meaning to one's life.

On the other hand, merely wishing for something is more of a desire or longing for a specific outcome or situation, without necessarily attributing it to a higher power or external force. Wishing is often more passive and does not necessarily involve a sense of belief or expectation that the desired outcome will come to fruition.

In essence, having hope in God can offer a deeper sense of connection and reassurance, while wishing for something may lack the same level of conviction and faith.

Comment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern, effectively distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking. The explanation that having hope in God involves belief in a higher power who can bring about positive outcomes or provide comfort and guidance is consistent with the provided answer. The contrast between hope and wishing for something is also well-articulated, highlighting the importance of faith and trust in the divine.

While the response does not explicitly state that hope in God is based on confident trust in His faithfulness and promise-keeping, it does convey this idea through its discussion of the difference between hope and wishing. The language used is clear and concise, making it easy to follow the author's reasoning.

To reach a score of 100, the response could have more explicitly linked the concept of hope in God to the provided answer.

Nonetheless, the overall grade remains high due to the response's effective communication of the concern and its underlying ideas.
