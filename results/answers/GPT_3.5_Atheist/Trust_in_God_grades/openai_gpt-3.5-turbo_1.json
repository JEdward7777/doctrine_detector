  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response does an excellent job of distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation in God's faithfulness and mere wishful thinking. The student effectively expands on the concept by explaining the deeper sense of connection and reassurance that comes from having hope in God compared to simply wishing for something. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the concern and addresses it thoroughly from a Christian perspective."
