  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The answer largely misses the mark in addressing how a person can demonstrate trustworthiness according to Biblical principles. It fails to acknowledge the foundational importance of faith in God and obedience to His Word in the context of trustworthiness. The response also downplays the unique moral authority that biblical principles carry in guiding one's actions. A stronger answer would have highlighted the biblical teachings on honesty, integrity, selflessness, and love as essential components of trustworthiness in line with God's commands."
