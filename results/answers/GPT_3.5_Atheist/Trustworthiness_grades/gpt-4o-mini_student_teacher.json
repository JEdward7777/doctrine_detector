However, the answer falls short in addressing the concern specifically related to Biblical principles. While it acknowledges that biblical teachings emphasize honesty and integrity, it does not effectively demonstrate how encouraging followers to live in accordance with these teachings can be a key aspect of demonstrating trustworthiness. In a Christian worldview, trustworthiness is deeply rooted in biblical principles, and this connection could have been more explicitly highlighted in the response."
