  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the concept of trustworthiness from an agnostic perspective. It highlights reliable and responsible behavior as essential elements of trustworthiness, aligning with the teacher's reference answer. However, the answer lacks a direct engagement with biblical principles as explicitly stated in the concern. While the student acknowledges that biblical principles can provide guidelines for trustworthiness, the connection to their practical application is not fully explored."
