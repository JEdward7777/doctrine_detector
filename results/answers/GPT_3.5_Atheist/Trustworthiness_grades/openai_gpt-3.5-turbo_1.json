However, the initial response, while acknowledging the value of trustworthiness, focuses on a secular perspective without giving due weight to the foundational principles provided by the Bible. Encouraging individuals to uphold trustworthiness based on Biblical teachings is crucial for Christians to live out their faith authentically."
