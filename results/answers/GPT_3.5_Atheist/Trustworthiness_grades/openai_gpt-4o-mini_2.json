However, the initial response strays from a Christian worldview by focusing on atheistic perspectives and secular ethics. While trustworthiness can indeed be demonstrated through actions regardless of religious beliefs, it is important to emphasize the biblical foundation for integrity and reliability within a Christian-specific worldview. More direct references to biblical teachings and principles would have strengthened the response."
