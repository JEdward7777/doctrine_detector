The explanation of brotherly love (philia) and romantic love (eros) in relation to biblical principles is clear and supported by relevant scripture references. The student effectively conveys the importance of selflessness, compassion, and kindness in all forms of loving relationships. Overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding of how different forms of love can fit into the biblical definition of love."
