  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of how brotherly love and romantic love fit into the biblical definition of love, highlighting the importance of kindness, compassion, and selflessness in all forms of loving relationships. The response effectively integrates relevant biblical passages and concepts to support their points. However, deducting a few points for not explicitly mentioning that all forms of love should align with the principles of God's love, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
