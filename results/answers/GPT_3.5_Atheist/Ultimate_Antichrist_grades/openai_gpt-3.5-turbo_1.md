In the book of Revelation, the figure commonly identified as the ultimate antichrist is the beast, specifically the beast from the sea described in Revelation 13. This beast is often interpreted as a symbol of oppressive and tyrannical political power, rather than a specific individual. Interpretations of the antichrist vary among different religious traditions and scholars, and it is important to consider the historical and cultural context in which the book of Revelation was written to understand its symbolism.

Comment: The response provides a strong explanation of the beast in Revelation 13, correctly identifying it as a symbol of the ultimate antichrist who will be defeated by Jesus. However, the concern about eschatological figures helping Christians prepare for faith challenges could be further emphasized to connect the explanation with the relevance for believers today. Overall, a solid understanding but could enhance the application to faith.
