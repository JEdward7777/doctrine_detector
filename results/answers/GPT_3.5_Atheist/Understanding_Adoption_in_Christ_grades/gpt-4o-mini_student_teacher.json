  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a strong answer that captures the essence of spiritual adoption in the Christian faith according to Ephesians 1:5. They correctly mentioned the special relationship believers have with God through faith in Jesus Christ and highlighted the privileges and rights that come with being adopted as children of God. The only slight improvement could have been to explicitly mention the co-heirship with Christ aspect emphasized in the reference answer. Otherwise, the response effectively conveys the spiritual significance of adoption in Christianity."
