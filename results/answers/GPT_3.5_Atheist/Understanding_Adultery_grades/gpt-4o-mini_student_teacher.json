They have correctly highlighted the severity of adultery as a violation of the marital covenant and God's intention for relationships. The clarity of explanation and inclusion of relevant biblical references are commendable. However, the answer could have been strengthened by incorporating more direct references like Exodus 20:14 and Revelation 2:22 to support their points further."
