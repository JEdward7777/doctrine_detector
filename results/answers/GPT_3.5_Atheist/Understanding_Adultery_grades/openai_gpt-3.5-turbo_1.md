# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, adultery is often portrayed as a serious violation of the marital covenant and a sin with significant consequences. In the Old Testament, under Mosaic Law, the punishment for adultery could be severe, including death for both the man and the woman involved (Leviticus 20:10). 

In the New Testament, Jesus also speaks out against adultery, teaching that even looking at someone with lust in your heart is akin to committing adultery (Matthew 5:27-28). Adultery is seen as a betrayal of the marital bond and a violation of God's intention for human relationships.

While the Bible does not explicitly outline specific earthly consequences for committing adultery, it does emphasize the importance of marital faithfulness and the sanctity of the marriage covenant. Ultimately, the consequences of adultery can vary in different cultural and societal contexts, but the spiritual and emotional toll of infidelity is often significant for all parties involved.
