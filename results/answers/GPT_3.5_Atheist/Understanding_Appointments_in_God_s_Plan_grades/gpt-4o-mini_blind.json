However, it could be strengthened by further emphasizing the biblical basis for predestination, such as referencing passages like Ephesians 1:4-5 or Romans 8:29-30. Additionally, a clearer distinction could be made between Calvinist views on predestination and the broader spectrum of beliefs within Christianity regarding free will and salvation."
