  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in Christian theology, highlighting the idea of predestination and God's role in salvation. The answer effectively addresses the concern of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation. However, the student could have emphasized more on the aspect of God's sovereign will and grace in choosing individuals for eternal life, similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
