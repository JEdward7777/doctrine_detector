  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" as being chosen by God to receive eternal life based on His sovereign will and grace. It aligns well with the Christian doctrine of predestination and emphasizes God's role in salvation. The response acknowledges the variations in interpretation among different Christian denominations while staying focused on the concept of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation."
