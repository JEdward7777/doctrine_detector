However, it falls short in doctrinal correctness by emphasizing a culturally retributive perspective and comparing Christ's sacrifice to ancient rituals of appeasement. The significance of Christ's death as the permanent atonement for sin should be rooted in the biblical understanding of Jesus as the perfect sacrifice satisfying the wrath of God and providing redemption through His blood. The answer could benefit from clearer scriptural references and a stronger emphasis on the theological implications of Christ's atonement."
