It delves into the theological concept of retribution and justice, illustrating the necessity of Christ's sacrifice for the redemption of humanity. The cultural and historical context is also explored well, emphasizing the deep symbolic value of Christ's death. The only minor improvement could be incorporating more scriptural references to support the theological assertions made."
