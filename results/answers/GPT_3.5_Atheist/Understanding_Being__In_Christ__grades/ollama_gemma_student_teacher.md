"In Christ" is a concept in Christian theology that signifies being united or aligned with the teachings, example, and values of Jesus Christ. It often refers to the belief that believers are spiritually connected to Christ through faith, and that this connection brings about a transformation in their lives. Followers of Christianity strive to live "in Christ" by following his teachings, emulating his behavior, and seeking to embody the virtues of love, compassion, forgiveness, and humility that he exemplified.
