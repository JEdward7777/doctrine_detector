While the response does not delve deeply into the concept of spiritual identity, it sets the foundation for understanding this concept in relation to faith in Jesus. The only area for improvement is that the response could have explored more explicitly how being \"in Christ\" relates to one's spiritual identity and how this identity shapes their daily life."
