Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear distinction between believing in something and believing someone, capturing the idea of trust and acceptance of truth. However, it lacks a direct reference to God or a Christian perspective, which could strengthen the understanding of faith in relation to trust in God and others. Integrating a Christian worldview would have further enriched the response.
