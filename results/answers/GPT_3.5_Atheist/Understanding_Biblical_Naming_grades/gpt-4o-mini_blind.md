## [Answer](../Understanding_Biblical_Naming.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the context of biblical naming, the phrase "His name is called John" refers to the naming of John the Baptist in the New Testament. In Luke 1:13, an angel tells John's father, Zechariah, that his son is to be named John. This act of naming holds significance in the biblical narrative as it symbolizes the divine purpose and blessing upon John the Baptist, who would later become a prominent figure in Christianity for his role in preparing the way for Jesus Christ. In this sense, the act of naming in the Bible is often seen as a reflection of divine will and purpose for the individual being named.
