  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained answer regarding the significance of the naming of John the Baptist in the biblical context and tied it eloquently to the divine purpose and blessing upon him. However, the answer missed the direct interpretation stated in the reference answer, which simply says that it means the person is called John. A stronger connection to the reference answer would have improved the grade."
