  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob according to Biblical accounts. They correctly highlighted the consequences for both brothers in terms of inheritance rights and blessings. However, the student could have emphasized more on the spiritual implications and the issue of priorities in the context of faith. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
