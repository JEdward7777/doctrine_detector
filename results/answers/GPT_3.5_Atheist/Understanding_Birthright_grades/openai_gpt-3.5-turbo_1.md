# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Biblical account, Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob had significant implications for both brothers. For Esau, it meant giving up his inheritance rights as the firstborn son, including a double portion of his father's wealth and the leadership role within the family. This decision was portrayed as impulsive and shortsighted, as Esau traded his future blessings for immediate gratification (a bowl of stew).

On the other hand, Jacob benefited greatly from this transaction, as he acquired the birthright and blessings traditionally reserved for the firstborn son. This act played a crucial role in shaping Jacob's future as a prominent figure in the Bible, including becoming the father of the twelve tribes of Israel.

Overall, Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob resulted in a reversal of fortunes for the two brothers, with Jacob ultimately gaining the advantages and blessings that Esau had relinquished. This story serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of prioritizing temporary pleasures over long-term consequences.
