  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of blasphemy within Judeo-Christian traditions, addressing the seriousness of the offense and its implications. The student correctly highlights the importance of reverence and respect for the divine in religious contexts. However, the atheistic perspective presented at the beginning of the response may not fully align with a Christian worldview. The grading takes this into consideration and deducts some points for this discrepancy."
