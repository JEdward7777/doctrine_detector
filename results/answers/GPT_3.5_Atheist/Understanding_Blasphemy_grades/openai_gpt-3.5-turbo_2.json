However, the perspective provided is from an atheistic point of view which may not fully align with the concern of understanding blasphemy to help Christians avoid disrespectful speech and behavior. The response lacked a clear connection to the specified concern and did not emphasize the importance of respecting God in line with a Christian worldview. More integration of Christian beliefs and values related to blasphemy would have strengthened the response."
