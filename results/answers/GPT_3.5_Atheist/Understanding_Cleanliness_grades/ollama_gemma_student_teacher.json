They acknowledge the limitations of applying these ancient laws to modern morality and propose a more nuanced approach. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the spiritual significance of cleanliness in a Christian worldview. The reference answer highlights the symbolic connection between physical purity and moral purity, which is an important aspect to explore in the context of Christian ethics."
