In 1 John 3:20, the verse states, "If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything." This verse can be understood in the context of self-reflection and the internal struggle that individuals may face when dealing with guilt or feelings of condemnation. It emphasizes the idea that God's knowledge and understanding surpass our own, and we should ultimately trust in his judgment rather than solely relying on our own self-condemnation.

In Romans 5:16, the verse reads, "And the result of God’s gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man’s sin. For Adam’s sin led to condemnation, but God’s free gift leads to our being made right with God, even though we are guilty of many sins." This verse discusses the contrast between the consequences of sin through Adam's disobedience and the redemption offered through God's grace. It highlights the idea that while sin may lead to condemnation, God's grace and forgiveness provide a way for individuals to be reconciled with him, despite their sinful nature.

As an atheistic scholar, it is important to approach these biblical teachings with the understanding that they reflect religious beliefs and doctrines. From a secular perspective, concepts of condemnation and redemption can be viewed as aspects of religious faith that hold significance for believers, but may not necessarily hold the same weight or relevance for those who do not adhere to the same religious traditions. It is essential to approach these teachings with respect for the diversity of beliefs and worldviews that exist within different cultural and religious contexts.
