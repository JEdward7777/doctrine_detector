  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that accurately references James 3:10 and includes additional supporting verses from Proverbs. The student effectively connects the implications of cursing others with the teachings of the Bible. However, the answer could have been improved by further emphasizing the spiritual implications and consequences of cursing, aligning more closely with the specific focus provided in the concern."
