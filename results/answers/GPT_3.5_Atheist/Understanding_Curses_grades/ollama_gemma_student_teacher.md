In James 3:10, it is stated that "Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be." This passage suggests that cursing others is considered wrong and should not be part of a believer's speech. 

In the Bible, there are several verses that warn against the harmful effects of cursing or speaking ill of others. For example, Proverbs 18:21 states that "The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit." This emphasizes the idea that the words we speak can have significant consequences, both for ourselves and for others.

Overall, the Bible teaches that cursing others or speaking negatively about them can have destructive effects on relationships and can lead to further conflict and harm. It promotes the idea of speaking words of love, kindness, and encouragement, rather than words that tear others down.
