Being a disciple of Jesus historically implies following his teachings as recorded in biblical texts and striving to live a life in accordance with those teachings. However, from a cultural perspective, being a disciple of Jesus can be seen as embodying values such as love, compassion, forgiveness, and service to others, irrespective of religious beliefs.

Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of believing in Jesus, obeying His teachings, and following His example as essential aspects of being a disciple. However, the initial response strays from the specific Christian worldview by emphasizing a more culturally-relative perspective on discipleship rather than acknowledging the foundational beliefs and responsibilities associated with being a disciple of Jesus Christ.
