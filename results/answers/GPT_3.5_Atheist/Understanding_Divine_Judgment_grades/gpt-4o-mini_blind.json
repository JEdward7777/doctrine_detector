  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the difference between God's judgment and human judgment, emphasizing the divine attributes of fairness, justice, and wisdom in God's judgment. The inclusion of a relevant Bible verse (Romans 2:6-8) adds to the strength of the answer. The student effectively contrasts the infallibility of God's judgment with the fallibility of human judgment. To improve, the student could incorporate more Scriptural references and delve deeper into the theological implications of God's judgment in comparison to human judgment. Overall, a good understanding is demonstrated."
