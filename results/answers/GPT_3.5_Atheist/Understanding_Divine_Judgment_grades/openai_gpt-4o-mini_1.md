## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, God's judgment is portrayed as being fair, just, and ultimately based on divine wisdom and perfect knowledge. As stated in Romans 2:6-8, "He will repay each person according to what they have done. To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger."

God's judgment is seen as being impartial and ultimate, extending beyond this earthly life to the afterlife. Human judgment, on the other hand, is fallible and limited by bias, prejudice, and imperfect understanding. It is based on human laws and societal norms, which can change over time and vary between cultures.

Ultimately, the difference between God's judgment and human judgment lies in the belief that God's judgment is infallible and based on divine justice, while human judgment is subject to error and influenced by human limitations.
