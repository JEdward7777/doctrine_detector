  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment by highlighting key aspects such as God's perfect righteousness and justice, the influence of sin, and the call to repentance. It aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the superiority of God's judgment over human judgment. The only minor critique is that it could have offered a bit more depth or specific examples to further illustrate the differences between God's judgment and human judgment."
