  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the term \"divine nature\" from various perspectives, including atheistic views, which shows a comprehensive understanding of different viewpoints. However, the answer lacks a clear focus on the specific characteristics of God as outlined in the Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student should have emphasized the attributes of God such as holiness, love, justice, and power, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer."
