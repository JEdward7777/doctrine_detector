However, it falls short of addressing the concern that understanding God's nature is essential for developing a personal relationship with Him and living according to His will from a Christian worldview. It misses the opportunity to emphasize the significance of recognizing God's inherent attributes such as holiness, love, justice, and power in shaping one's understanding and relationship with Him."
