  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general overview of various perspectives within Christianity regarding inheriting eternal life but lacks doctrinal correctness. The answer does not fully reflect the core Biblical teachings on this topic, such as the centrality of faith in Jesus Christ for salvation (Ephesians 2:8-9) and the importance of Jesus as the only way to eternal life (John 14:6). The answer also appears to suggest a works-based approach to salvation, which contradicts the understanding of salvation by grace through faith alone in many Christian traditions. The student should focus on presenting a more accurate and Biblically sound perspective on inheriting eternal life in future responses."
