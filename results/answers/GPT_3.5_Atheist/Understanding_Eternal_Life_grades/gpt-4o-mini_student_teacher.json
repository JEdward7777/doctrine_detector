The answer should emphasize the importance of obedience to God's laws and faith in Him as the core teachings from the Bible regarding eternal life. The response could have delved deeper into the specific biblical passages that highlight these teachings to provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding rooted in Christian faith."
