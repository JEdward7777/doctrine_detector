  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the correct answer, emphasizing that inheriting eternal life is contingent upon one's beliefs and actions. It also highlights the importance of faith in Jesus Christ and living a righteous and moral life. The mention of different interpretations within Christianity adds nuance to the discussion.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by providing more specific biblical support for the idea that faith and obedience are necessary for inheriting eternal life. Additionally, while it's accurate to say that good works are important in Christian tradition, the response doesn't explicitly connect these actions to the promise of eternal life.\n\nOverall, this is a solid response that demonstrates an understanding of the importance of eternity and the criteria for inheriting eternal life. With some additional development and biblical support, it could be even stronger.\n\nComment: This response shows a good grasp of the Christian perspective on eternal life, but could benefit from more explicit biblical references to support its claims."
