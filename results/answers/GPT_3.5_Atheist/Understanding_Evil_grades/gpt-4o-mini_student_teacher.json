  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-articulated explanation of the distinction between \"evil\" and \"wickedness\" in the context of biblical teachings, highlighting the nuances in their meanings. The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and effectively addresses the concern of ensuring clarity on the moral implications of behaviors and character according to biblical teachings. However, the reference answer from the teacher offers a more succinct and direct explanation of the distinction, which is why the grade is slightly lower."
