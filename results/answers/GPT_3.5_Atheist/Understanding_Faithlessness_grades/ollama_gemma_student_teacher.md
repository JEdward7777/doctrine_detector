The term 'faithless' implies that a person lacks faith or belief in God. In a culturally retributed context, being labeled as faithless may carry negative connotations, suggesting that the person is seen as rejecting or turning away from the dominant belief system of the culture. It may imply that the person is considered to be morally deficient or misguided in the eyes of those who adhere to the predominant religious beliefs. However, it is important to recognize that beliefs about faith and God are subjective and personal, and individuals should be free to hold their own beliefs without facing judgment or discrimination.
