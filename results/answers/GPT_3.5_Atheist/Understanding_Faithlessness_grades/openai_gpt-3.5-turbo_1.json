The explanation is clear and acknowledges the implications of being labeled as faithless in a culturally retributed context. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of faith in grounding moral values from a Christian perspective, as faith in God is considered foundational for moral conduct in Christianity. Additionally, it could have emphasized the potential consequences of rejecting faith in God, as seen in the context of Christianity where faith in God is linked to salvation and living in accordance with divine principles."
