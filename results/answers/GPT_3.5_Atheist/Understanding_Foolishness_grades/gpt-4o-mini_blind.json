The student accurately references Psalm 14:1 and Proverbs 1:7 to support their points. However, to improve the response, the student could have included additional verses or examples from the Bible that illustrate the consequences or outcomes of being a fool in terms of belief and obedience to God. Nonetheless, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical perspective on foolishness."
