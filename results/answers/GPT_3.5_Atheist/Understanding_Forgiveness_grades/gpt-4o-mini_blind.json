  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a solid understanding of forgiveness according to Christian teaching. The student accurately highlights key aspects such as letting go of negative emotions, pardoning the offender, restoring relationships, and reflecting God's mercy and love. One suggestion for improvement would be to also mention the concept of repentance and seeking reconciliation, as these are often integral components of forgiveness in Christian theology."
