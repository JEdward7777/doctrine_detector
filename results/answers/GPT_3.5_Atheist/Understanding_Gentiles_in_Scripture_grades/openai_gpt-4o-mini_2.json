It effectively addresses the concern about the historical context of Jewish-Gentile relationships and their impact on the church's unity. The integration of relevant biblical figures like the apostle Paul adds depth to the discussion. The response could strengthen its connection to Christian teachings on unity and acceptance to align more closely with a Christian worldview."
