## [Answer](../Understanding_Gentiles_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The Israelites' perception of Gentiles played a significant role in shaping their relationships with them in the early church. The historical context of Jewish-Gentile relations was marked by centuries of cultural, religious, and political tensions. The Israelites viewed Gentiles as outsiders who did not follow their religious customs and beliefs. This perception often led to a sense of superiority and exclusivity among the Israelites, making it challenging for them to fully embrace Gentiles as equals in the early church.

The issue of how to incorporate Gentiles into the early church was a central debate among early Christian communities. Some Jewish Christians believed that Gentiles should first convert to Judaism and follow Jewish laws and customs before being accepted into the Christian community. This viewpoint reflected the deep-seated reluctance among some Israelites to fully integrate Gentiles into the church without them adhering to Jewish traditions.

However, other Jewish Christians, such as the apostle Paul, advocated for a more inclusive approach that welcomed Gentiles into the church without requiring them to follow Jewish customs. This more progressive stance challenged the traditional perceptions of Gentiles held by many Israelites and emphasized the universal message of Christianity.

Ultimately, the early church's evolving understanding of the relationship between Israelites and Gentiles helped shape its identity as a diverse and inclusive community that transcended cultural boundaries. The tension between the Israelites' perception of Gentiles as outsiders and the Christian message of love and acceptance towards all individuals underscored the complexities of navigating cultural retributions within the early church.
