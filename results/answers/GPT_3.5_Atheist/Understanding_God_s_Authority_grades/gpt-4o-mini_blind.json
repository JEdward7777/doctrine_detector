They have effectively highlighted the supreme authority and power of God, emphasizing his position as the ultimate ruler and sovereign. The reference to divine retribution, accountability, and judgment aligns well with Christian teachings on God's sovereignty and justice. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
