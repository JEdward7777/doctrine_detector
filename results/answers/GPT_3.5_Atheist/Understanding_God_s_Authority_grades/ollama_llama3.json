However, to better address the concern about believers struggling to comprehend the implications of God's sovereignty in their personal lives, the response could delve deeper into how this title affects our daily lives and decisions. For instance, it could explore how recognizing God's authority over all aspects of life can lead to a sense of accountability, causing us to make choices that align with His will. While the provided response touches on the idea of divine retribution, it could be further developed to provide more practical applications for believers.
