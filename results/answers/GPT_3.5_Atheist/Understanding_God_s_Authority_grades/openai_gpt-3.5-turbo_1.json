It appropriately highlighted the aspect of divine sovereignty. However, there could have been an additional emphasis on how believers might struggle to comprehend the implications of God's sovereignty in their personal lives from a Christian worldview perspective. More discussion on this concern would have further enriched the response and provided a deeper insight into the practical implications of God's sovereignty for believers."
