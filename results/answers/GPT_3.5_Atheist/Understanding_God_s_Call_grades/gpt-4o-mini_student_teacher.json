  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively captures the essence of God's personal relationship and intention towards individuals when stating that God has called us by name. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept and conveys the implications of being known and chosen by God. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of explicitly mentioning God's specific appointment of individuals for His purpose, which is a key aspect of the Biblical concept. Overall, the response reflects a sound interpretation from a Christian worldview."
