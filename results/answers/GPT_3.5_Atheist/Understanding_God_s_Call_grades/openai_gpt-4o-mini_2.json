  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90.\n\nThis response effectively expands on the initial answer by delving into the depth of God's personal relationship with individuals and the specific purpose He has for each person. It accurately captures the essence of God's intimate knowledge and care for every individual, which aligns well with the Christian belief in a personal God who calls each person by name. The explanation enhances understanding of God's personal involvement in the lives of believers. Great job in addressing the concern with a clear Christian worldview perspective."
