  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of the concept of being 'called' by God, but lacks depth and a clear Christian perspective on the matter. The response focuses more on a secular interpretation and does not highlight the importance of this belief within Christianity. Additionally, the answer does not directly address the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith as requested. The student could improve by delving deeper into the biblical foundation and theological implications of being 'called' by God for Christians."
