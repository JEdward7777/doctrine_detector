However, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing Jesus' divinity as central to his favor with both God and men, as belief in Jesus as the Son of God is core to Christian doctrine. Additionally, mentioning his sacrificial death for the forgiveness of sins and the salvation he brought to humanity would have further enriched the answer from a Christian perspective."
