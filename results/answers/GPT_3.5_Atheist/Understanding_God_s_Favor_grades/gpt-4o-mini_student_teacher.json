  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer discussing various aspects of how Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and men through his teachings, actions, and interactions. However, the response slightly missed the mark on directly addressing the concern of Christians emulating these qualities. The focus on interpretations could have been more clearly tied back to the importance of Christians striving to emulate Jesus in order to gain favor with God and others."
