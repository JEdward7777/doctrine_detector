In the Bible, Jesus is depicted as demonstrating favor with both God and men through his teachings and actions. He was believed to be the Son of God and was seen as having a special relationship with God, showing favor through his miracles, compassion, and wisdom.

Additionally, Jesus also gained favor with men by his charisma, moral teachings, and acts of kindness and healing. His ability to connect with people from all walks of life and his willingness to challenge existing social norms contributed to his popularity among many.

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive answer discussing various aspects of how Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and men through his teachings, actions, and interactions. However, the response slightly missed the mark on directly addressing the concern of Christians emulating these qualities. The focus on interpretations could have been more clearly tied back to the importance of Christians striving to emulate Jesus in order to gain favor with God and others.
