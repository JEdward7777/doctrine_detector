  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the differences between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory. The answer demonstrates a clear grasp of the transcendent and divine nature of God's glory, contrasting it effectively with the temporary and shallow nature of worldly glory. However, the student's explanation could have delved deeper into emphasizing the immeasurable superiority of God's glory in value, worth, and majesty over earthly glory, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview but could have been enhanced by emphasizing the unique and supreme nature of God's glory even further."
