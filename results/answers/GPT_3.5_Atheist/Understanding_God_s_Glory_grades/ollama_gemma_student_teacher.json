  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the distinction between God's glory and worldly glory from a Christian worldview. The student clearly articulates that God's glory is eternal, unchanging, and stems from his perfect character, while worldly glory is temporary, superficial, and ultimately meaningless. The response aligns well with the reference answer and demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the supreme and unrivaled nature of God's glory."
