## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
Seeking God's will in our everyday decisions typically refers to the belief that there is a divine plan or purpose for each individual, and by aligning our choices and actions with this plan, we can lead a more fulfilling and righteous life. However, as an atheistic scholar, I would approach this concept from a secular perspective.

Instead of attributing decisions to a divine will, one could interpret seeking "God's will" as a metaphor for seeking personal growth, self-awareness, and ethical behavior. By reflecting on our values, priorities, and the potential impact of our choices on ourselves and others, we can make more informed and morally sound decisions. This approach emphasizes personal responsibility and critical thinking rather than relying on external sources of guidance.

In this context, seeking "God's will" could be seen as a way to promote self-improvement, empathy, and mindfulness in our interactions with the world around us. It encourages us to consider the broader consequences of our actions and strive to live in accordance with our values and principles.
