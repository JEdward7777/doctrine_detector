  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer strays significantly from a Christian worldview by interpreting \"seeking God's will\" as a metaphor for personal growth and ethical behavior rather than understanding it as aligning with God's desires and plans as revealed in Scripture. The student's perspective does not address the concern that people may struggle with making decisions that honor God or feel uncertain about His direction for their lives. The answer lacks a foundation in Christian beliefs and teachings, resulting in a low grade from a Christian worldview perspective."
