While the student rejects the traditional theological view of divine predetermination, they suggest an alternative interpretation that emphasizes personal growth, self-awareness, and ethical behavior as key elements of seeking God's will. This approach aligns well with the Christian emphasis on personal responsibility and conformity to God's values. However, the answer could benefit from more explicit engagement with the provided reference answer, which emphasizes the role of Scripture in discerning God's will."
