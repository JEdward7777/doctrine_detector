While the idea of seeking personal growth, self-awareness, and ethical behavior is commendable, the key aspect of aligning one's choices with what is pleasing to God as revealed in Scripture is missing. From a Christian worldview, seeking God's will involves acknowledging His authority and guidance in our lives, not merely a metaphor for self-improvement and mindfulness. The response falls short in addressing the concern of people struggling with honoring God in decision-making and feeling uncertain about His direction."
