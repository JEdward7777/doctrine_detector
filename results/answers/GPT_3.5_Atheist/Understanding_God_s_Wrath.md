The concept of God's wrath in the Bible is often interpreted in different ways, depending on the theological tradition and individual interpretation. In general, God's wrath is seen as a divine response to sin and disobedience, as reflected in passages such as Romans 1:18 which states, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men."

One key difference between God's wrath and human anger is that God's wrath is seen as a just and righteous response to sin, whereas human anger is often rooted in emotions such as fear, insecurity, or selfishness. In the Bible, God's wrath is portrayed as a necessary aspect of His holiness and justice, intended to bring about repentance and restoration.

It's important to note that interpretations of God's wrath can vary widely among different religious traditions and theological perspectives, and there is ongoing debate among scholars about the nature and implications of this concept. Ultimately, how one understands God's wrath is shaped by their broader beliefs about divine justice, mercy, and the nature of God Himself.
