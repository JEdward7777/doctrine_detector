  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a generally accurate overview of the concept of God's wrath in the Bible, highlighting its divine and just nature in contrast to human anger. The student could improve by incorporating specific references to additional biblical passages that illustrate God's wrath and by emphasizing the ultimate purpose of God's wrath in the context of redemption and restoration. Additionally, connecting God's wrath to broader theological themes such as holiness, justice, and mercy would strengthen the response."
