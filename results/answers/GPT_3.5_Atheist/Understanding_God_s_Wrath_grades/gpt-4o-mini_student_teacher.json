  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of God's wrath in the Bible, highlighting the difference between God's wrath and human anger. They correctly emphasize that God's wrath is a just and righteous response to sin, unlike human anger which can be rooted in negative emotions. However, the student could have delved deeper into specific biblical examples and teachings to support their points and could have emphasized more on the importance of God's wrath as a measure of His holiness and justice, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
