  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response accurately captures the essence of God's wrath as described in the Bible, highlighting its righteous and measured nature. The writer correctly distinguishes between God's wrath and human anger, emphasizing that God's response is not an impulsive outburst but rather a deliberate judgment against sin. The mention of rebellion against God and the goal of upholding justice and holiness also shows a good understanding of the biblical context.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more specific biblical examples or elaboration on how God's wrath is portrayed in different passages. Additionally, while the response does acknowledge that God's wrath is a measured response, it could benefit from further exploration of this idea and how it relates to human understandings of anger and justice.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of God's wrath and its importance in Christian theology."
