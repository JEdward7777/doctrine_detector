It correctly highlights that God's wrath is a measured response to sin, not a fit of rage, aligning well with the specified concern. The response could further deepen the explanation by discussing how God's wrath ultimately aims at restoration and repentance, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept."
