## Question [Understanding Heaven's Definition](../../questions/Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md)
What is the biblical definition of 'heaven' and how does it differ from 'sky'?

## Target answer from notes
In the Bible, 'heaven' usually refers to where God lives, while 'sky' refers to the blue expanse above the earth. The term 'heavens' encompasses everything above the earth, including celestial bodies like the sun and stars.

## Concern to grade by
It's essential to understand the different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture, as they can impact our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him.

## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the biblical context, 'heaven' is often depicted as a realm above the earth where God dwells, as well as the final destination of believers after death. It is described as a place of eternal joy, peace, and perfection. The concept of heaven in the Bible transcends the physical sky and is more closely associated with a spiritual realm beyond earthly existence.

On the other hand, 'sky' refers to the part of the atmosphere above the earth where clouds, the sun, moon, and stars are located. In the Bible, the sky is often referred to in a more literal and immediate sense, such as when describing the creation story or the appearance of angels.

So, in summary, while the terms 'heaven' and 'sky' can both refer to the space above us, the biblical definition of heaven is more nuanced and carries spiritual and metaphysical connotations beyond just the physical sky.
