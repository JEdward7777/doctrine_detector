  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out explanation of the biblical definitions of 'heaven' and 'sky' and how they differ. They correctly highlighted the spiritual and metaphysical aspects associated with heaven, aligning well with a Christian worldview. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused on the specific differences between 'heaven' and 'sky' mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
