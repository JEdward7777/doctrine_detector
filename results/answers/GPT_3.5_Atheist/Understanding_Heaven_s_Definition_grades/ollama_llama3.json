  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe student provides a good introduction to the biblical context, accurately describing heaven as a realm above earth where God dwells and the final destination of believers after death. They also correctly note that the concept of heaven in the Bible transcends the physical sky. Additionally, they distinguish between \"heaven\" and \"sky\", recognizing that while both refer to the space above us, \"heaven\" carries more spiritual connotations.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the student's understanding of the terms is not as nuanced as it could be. They simply state that \"heavens\" encompasses everything above earth, including celestial bodies, without fully exploring the biblical distinction between heaven and sky. Furthermore, while they acknowledge the importance of understanding these terms in Scripture, their response does not engage deeply with the concern about how this understanding impacts our relationship with God.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good foundation in biblical concepts but could benefit from further exploration and application of these ideas to their faith."
