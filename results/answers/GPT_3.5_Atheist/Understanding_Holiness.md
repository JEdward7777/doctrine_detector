## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of God being absolutely holy is a belief held within certain religious traditions, particularly within Christianity and Judaism. In these traditions, holiness is often understood as moral perfection or purity beyond human comprehension.

For believers, the idea of God being absolutely holy can impact their relationship with Him in various ways. It can inspire feelings of reverence, awe, and humility, as they acknowledge the vast difference between their own imperfections and God's supposed perfection. This can lead to a sense of unworthiness or a desire to strive for moral excellence in order to please a perfect deity.

However, it is important to note that these beliefs are based on faith and are not supported by empirical evidence. From an atheistic perspective, the concept of God's absolute holiness is viewed as a subjective belief system that shapes individuals' perceptions and behaviors within a religious framework. It does not have any inherent factual basis outside of religious teachings.
