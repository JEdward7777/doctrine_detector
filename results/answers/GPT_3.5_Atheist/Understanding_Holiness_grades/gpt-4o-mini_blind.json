However, the answer predominantly focuses on an atheistic perspective and fails to address the question from a Christian worldview. The response lacks depth in explaining the significance of God's holiness in shaping believers' relationship with Him according to Christian teachings. Additionally, the conclusion dismisses the concept of God's holiness as merely subjective, which contradicts Christian doctrine. More emphasis on the biblical understanding of God's holiness and its impact on the Christian faith would have greatly improved the answer."
