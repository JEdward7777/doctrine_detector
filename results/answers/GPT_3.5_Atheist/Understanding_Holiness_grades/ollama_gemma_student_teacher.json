  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of God's absolute holiness and its implications for human relationships with God. It provides a concise explanation of the theological perspective on holiness within Christianity and Judaism, while also acknowledging the subjective and faith-based nature of the belief. The student's acknowledgment of the gap between human imperfection and God's perfection is particularly insightful. However, the answer would benefit from further elaboration on the specific implications of God's holiness for Christian living and ethics."
