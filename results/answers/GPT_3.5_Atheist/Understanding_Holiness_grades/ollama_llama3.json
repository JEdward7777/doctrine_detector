  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise explanation of what it means for God to be absolutely holy, citing examples from Christianity and Judaism. It also acknowledges the impact that this concept can have on believers' relationships with God, including feelings of reverence, awe, and humility.\n\nHowever, while the response does mention the idea that we cannot approach God without His allowance due to our sinful nature, it doesn't directly address the concern of reflecting on our own holiness and taking necessary steps to approach a holy God. The connection between these ideas is implicit rather than explicit.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest more explicitly tying the concept of God's absolute holiness to the concern about approaching Him in a manner that pleases Him. This could involve exploring what it means for humans to be made in God's image and how we can strive for moral excellence and purity in our own lives as we seek to draw near to Him.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively explains the concept of God's absolute holiness, but could benefit from further development and application to the concern at hand."
