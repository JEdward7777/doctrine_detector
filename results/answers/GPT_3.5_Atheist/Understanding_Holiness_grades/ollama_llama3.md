## Question [Understanding Holiness](../../../questions/Understanding_Holiness.md)
What does it mean for God to be absolutely holy, and how does that affect our relationship with Him?

## Correct Answer
God's absolute holiness means He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection, which indicates that we cannot approach Him without His allowance due to our sinful nature.

## Stated Concern
This question prompts reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of God being absolutely holy is a belief held within certain religious traditions, particularly within Christianity and Judaism. In these traditions, holiness is often understood as moral perfection or purity beyond human comprehension.

For believers, the idea of God being absolutely holy can impact their relationship with Him in various ways. It can inspire feelings of reverence, awe, and humility, as they acknowledge the vast difference between their own imperfections and God's supposed perfection. This can lead to a sense of unworthiness or a desire to strive for moral excellence in order to please a perfect deity.

However, it is important to note that these beliefs are based on faith and are not supported by empirical evidence. From an atheistic perspective, the concept of God's absolute holiness is viewed as a subjective belief system that shapes individuals' perceptions and behaviors within a religious framework. It does not have any inherent factual basis outside of religious teachings.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a clear and concise explanation of what it means for God to be absolutely holy, citing examples from Christianity and Judaism. It also acknowledges the impact that this concept can have on believers' relationships with God, including feelings of reverence, awe, and humility.

However, while the response does mention the idea that we cannot approach God without His allowance due to our sinful nature, it doesn't directly address the concern of reflecting on our own holiness and taking necessary steps to approach a holy God. The connection between these ideas is implicit rather than explicit.

To improve this response, I would suggest more explicitly tying the concept of God's absolute holiness to the concern about approaching Him in a manner that pleases Him. This could involve exploring what it means for humans to be made in God's image and how we can strive for moral excellence and purity in our own lives as we seek to draw near to Him.

Overall, this is a strong response that effectively explains the concept of God's absolute holiness, but could benefit from further development and application to the concern at hand.
