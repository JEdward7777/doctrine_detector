  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a fairly accurate overview of the concept of God's absolute holiness from an atheistic perspective, acknowledging that it is a belief held within religious traditions like Christianity and Judaism. The response correctly highlights the impact of this belief on believers' relationship with God. However, it falls short in addressing the concern provided, which emphasizes the reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God. The atheistic perspective presented does not engage with this concern adequately, hence the lower grade."
