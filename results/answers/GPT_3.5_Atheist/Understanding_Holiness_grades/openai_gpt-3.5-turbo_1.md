## Question [Understanding Holiness](../../../questions/Understanding_Holiness.md)
What does it mean for God to be absolutely holy, and how does that affect our relationship with Him?

## Correct Answer
God's absolute holiness means He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection, which indicates that we cannot approach Him without His allowance due to our sinful nature.

## Stated Concern
This question prompts reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of God being absolutely holy is a belief held within certain religious traditions, particularly within Christianity and Judaism. In these traditions, holiness is often understood as moral perfection or purity beyond human comprehension.

For believers, the idea of God being absolutely holy can impact their relationship with Him in various ways. It can inspire feelings of reverence, awe, and humility, as they acknowledge the vast difference between their own imperfections and God's supposed perfection. This can lead to a sense of unworthiness or a desire to strive for moral excellence in order to please a perfect deity.

However, it is important to note that these beliefs are based on faith and are not supported by empirical evidence. From an atheistic perspective, the concept of God's absolute holiness is viewed as a subjective belief system that shapes individuals' perceptions and behaviors within a religious framework. It does not have any inherent factual basis outside of religious teachings.

Grade: 65

Comment: The response provides a fairly accurate overview of the concept of God's absolute holiness from an atheistic perspective, acknowledging that it is a belief held within religious traditions like Christianity and Judaism. The response correctly highlights the impact of this belief on believers' relationship with God. However, it falls short in addressing the concern provided, which emphasizes the reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God. The atheistic perspective presented does not engage with this concern adequately, hence the lower grade.
