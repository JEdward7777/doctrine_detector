However, the atheistic perspective presented is limited in addressing the fundamental nature of holiness and our sinful state in relation to God. From a Christian worldview, it is important to consider the significance of God's holiness in light of our own sinfulness and the need for reconciliation through Christ. The response could have delved deeper into these key theological aspects within a Christian framework."
