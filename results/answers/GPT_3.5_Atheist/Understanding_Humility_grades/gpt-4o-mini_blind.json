  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 75.\n\nThe answer provides a good overview of the concept of humbling oneself before God from a cultural and general perspective. It touches upon submission, reverence, acknowledgment of shortcomings, respect, gratitude, seeking guidance, and surrendering pride. However, the response lacks specific references to biblical teachings or doctrines that define humility before God in the Christian faith. Incorporating more scriptural references or theological insights would have strengthened the answer and made it more doctrinally grounded. Additionally, emphasizing the centrality of repentance and faith in Jesus Christ as integral components of humility before God would have been beneficial."
