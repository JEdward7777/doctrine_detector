  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of humility before God from a cultural perspective and touches on important aspects such as submission, reverence, acknowledging weaknesses, and seeking guidance. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more explicitly on the Christian perspective outlined by the reference answer, which emphasizes submitting one's will to God and recognizing His greatness. The student's response overall aligns well with the concern but lacks a bit of precision in capturing the specific Christian understanding of humility before God."
