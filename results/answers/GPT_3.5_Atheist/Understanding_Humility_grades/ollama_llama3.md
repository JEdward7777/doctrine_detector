This act can be seen as a way to show respect and deference to God, to express gratitude for the blessings one has received, and to seek guidance and forgiveness. By humbling oneself before God, one is essentially recognizing their place in the larger cosmic order and surrendering their own ego and pride in favor of a deeper spiritual connection.
