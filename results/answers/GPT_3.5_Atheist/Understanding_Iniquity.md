## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In Christian theology, these terms are often used interchangeably, but some scholars do make distinctions between them. 

Sin is a broad term that refers to any action, thought, or deed that goes against the will of God. It is a violation of God's law and can include iniquity and transgression.

Iniquity is often seen as a more specific type of sin that emphasizes a twisted or perverse nature. It refers to the inherent wickedness or immoral behavior of an individual.

Transgression, on the other hand, is often understood as the specific act of crossing a boundary or violating a commandment. It is seen as a conscious rebellion against God's law.

Ultimately, all three terms convey the idea of wrongdoing or disobedience towards God, but iniquity emphasizes a corrupt nature, sin is a general term for any wrongdoing, and transgression specifically refers to the violation of a specific law or commandment.
