  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 85.\n\nThe answer provides a generally accurate explanation of the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression. It correctly identifies sin as a broad term encompassing any action contrary to God's will, iniquity as a deeper focus on inherent wickedness, and transgression as a specific act of crossing boundaries. \n\nHowever, there could be a bit more emphasis on the seriousness and severity of these concepts within Christian doctrine. It could also mention that all three terms ultimately point to a separation from God and the need for redemption through Christ. \n\nOverall, a solid explanation with room for deeper theological reflection."
