  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a fairly accurate explanation of the distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression within a Christian worldview. The student correctly emphasized that iniquity is often seen as a more specific type of sin, sin is a broader term encompassing any wrongdoing, and transgression involves violating a specific command or law. However, they could improve by highlighting that iniquity often refers to deliberate acts of great wickedness, as specified in the reference answer from the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic."
