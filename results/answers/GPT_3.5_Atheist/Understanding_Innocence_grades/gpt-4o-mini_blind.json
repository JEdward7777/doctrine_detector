The inclusion of scriptural references, such as Proverbs 17:15 and the example of Joseph in Genesis, adds depth to the discussion. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of innocence and its connection to seeking justice and righteousness in line with biblical teachings. However, the response could be further strengthened by elaborating on the theological significance of innocence in light of Jesus Christ's role as the ultimate innocent one who bore false accusations on behalf of humanity."
