  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided an insightful and well-supported response by referencing key Bible verses such as Romans 8:26-27 and John 14:26 to demonstrate the Holy Spirit's role in intercession. The student effectively explained how the Holy Spirit assists believers in prayer and communicates their needs to God. However, the student could have further deepened their understanding by incorporating more specific examples or explanations of how the Holy Spirit's intercession works in practice."
