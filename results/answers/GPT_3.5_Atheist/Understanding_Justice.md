## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I do not believe in the existence of a deity or divine laws. However, in many religious traditions, acting justly according to God's laws typically involves following ethical principles and moral guidelines set forth by that particular religious belief system. This may include treating others with kindness and compassion, upholding honesty and integrity, and striving for fairness and equality in one's actions.

It is important to understand that concepts of justice can vary greatly across different cultures and belief systems, and what may be considered just according to one religion may not be the same in another. Ultimately, acting justly according to God's laws is about living in accordance with the values and teachings of a specific religion, with the aim of promoting harmony, righteousness, and moral goodness in society.
