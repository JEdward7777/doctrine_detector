  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of different religious traditions' perspectives on acting justly according to God's laws, but it falls short in addressing the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness. The student's atheistic worldview also hinders them from providing a comprehensive understanding of justice according to a Christian-specific perspective. The answer lacks depth in relation to the concern provided, earning a lower grade."
