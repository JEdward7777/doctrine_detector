  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of justice according to a Christian worldview. While they acknowledge their atheism, they recognize the importance of ethical principles and moral guidelines in religious traditions. The student's explanation of treating others with kindness, upholding honesty, and striving for fairness aligns with the biblical standard of righteousness. However, the answer lacks a direct connection to specific biblical passages or teachings that address the concept of justice. Additionally, the student's statement about the variation in concepts of justice across cultures and belief systems is relevant but could be elaborated further."
