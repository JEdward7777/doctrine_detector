However, as an atheistic scholar, the perspective presented does not align with a Christian worldview. From a Christian viewpoint, justice is rooted in the standard set by God's Word, the Bible, which includes principles of love, forgiveness, and mercy alongside fairness and righteousness. It is essential to recognize the biblical foundation for fairness and righteousness when discussing acting justly according to God's laws from a Christian perspective."
