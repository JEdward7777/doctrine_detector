  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good understanding of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible, emphasizing authority, power, and rulership. They correctly connect the term to God's sovereignty and Jesus' divinity. However, the reference answer specifies that the term 'Lord' signifies ownership, which the student's answer does not address directly. Overall, a solid explanation with room for improvement in aligning more closely with the reference answer's focus on ownership."
