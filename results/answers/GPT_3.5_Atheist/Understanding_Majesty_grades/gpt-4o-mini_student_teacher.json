  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer at 85.\n\nWhile the student's answer does cover key aspects such as God's greatness, sovereignty, and authority, it includes unnecessary elaboration on how God's majesty is depicted across different religious traditions. The answer could have been more focused on the Christian-specific perspective, discussing God's majesty as the supreme King over the universe. The student's answer is detailed and accurate but lacks clarity in emphasizing God's sovereignty specifically within a Christian worldview."
