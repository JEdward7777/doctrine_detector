The term "majesty" when used in relation to God's character signifies his greatness, sovereignty, and authority. It reflects the belief that God is the supreme ruler and creator of the universe, possessing qualities of awe-inspiring power and glory.

85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer at 85.

While the student's answer does cover key aspects such as God's greatness, sovereignty, and authority, it includes unnecessary elaboration on how God's majesty is depicted across different religious traditions. The answer could have been more focused on the Christian-specific perspective, discussing God's majesty as the supreme King over the universe. The student's answer is detailed and accurate but lacks clarity in emphasizing God's sovereignty specifically within a Christian worldview.
