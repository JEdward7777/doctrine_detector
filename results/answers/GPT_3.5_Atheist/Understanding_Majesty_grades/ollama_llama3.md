85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 85.

The response effectively conveys the idea that God's majesty refers to His greatness, power, and authority, which aligns with the concern about understanding God's attributes and sovereignty. The description of God as the "supreme King over the universe" also accurately captures the sense of divine majesty.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or biblical references to support its claims. Additionally, while it mentions God's greatness and power, it does not explicitly address His transcendence above creation, which is an important aspect of understanding God's majesty.

Overall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding God's majesty, but could be further developed to demonstrate a more comprehensive grasp of this concept.
