  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by explaining the significance of the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's greatness and authority. It acknowledges God as the supreme King over the universe, reflecting his sovereignty over creation. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning God's transcendence, but overall, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of God's attributes and sovereignty from a Christian worldview."
