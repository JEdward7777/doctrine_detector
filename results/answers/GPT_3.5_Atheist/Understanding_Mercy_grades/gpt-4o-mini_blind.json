However, the answer could be enhanced by incorporating the concept of repentance and the role it plays in receiving God's mercy, as well as emphasizing the importance of seeking reconciliation with God through Christ for ultimate redemption. Additionally, referencing specific biblical examples or teachings on mercy could strengthen the theological foundation of the response."
