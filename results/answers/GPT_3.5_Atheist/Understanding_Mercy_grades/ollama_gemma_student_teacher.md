Mercy, as exemplified by God's nature in many religious traditions, can be demonstrated in our daily lives by practicing forgiveness, compassion, and understanding towards others. We can show mercy by choosing kindness over judgment, by offering help and support to those in need, and by treating others with respect and dignity even when they may have wronged us.
