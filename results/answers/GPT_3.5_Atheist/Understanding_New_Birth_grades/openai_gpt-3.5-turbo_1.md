## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The concept of being "born again" in the Bible, specifically in Christianity, refers to a spiritual rebirth or renewal of a person's life through faith in Jesus Christ. This term is derived from the teachings of Jesus in the Gospel of John, where he tells Nicodemus, a Pharisee and ruler of the Jews, that one must be born again to see the kingdom of God (John 3:3).

Being "born again" involves a transformation of one's inner being, a turning away from sin and a turning toward God. It signifies a new beginning, a new life in Christ, and a renewed relationship with God. It is often associated with the idea of repentance, accepting Jesus as one's savior, and receiving the Holy Spirit to guide and empower one in their Christian walk.

Ultimately, being "born again" is a deeply personal and spiritual experience for Christians, marking a significant turning point in their faith journey.
