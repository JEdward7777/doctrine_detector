## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of "perishing" is often used to describe the fate of those who do not accept the teachings of Jesus Christ or live a life in accordance with his teachings. To "perish" spiritually means to face eternal separation from God, a state of spiritual death and condemnation. This idea is central to the Christian belief in the need for salvation and the importance of accepting Jesus as the savior in order to avoid perishing and instead receive eternal life. It is a warning of the consequences of rejecting the message of salvation and living a life in opposition to God's will.
