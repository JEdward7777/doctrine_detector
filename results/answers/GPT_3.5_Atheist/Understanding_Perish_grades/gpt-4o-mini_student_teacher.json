  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of \"perishing\" in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament, emphasizing the idea of eternal separation from God for those who do not accept Jesus as their savior. The response accurately reflects the Christian belief in the consequences of rejecting salvation and living contrary to God's will. The only minor point for improvement would be to incorporate the specific mention of being lost or separated from the people of God in relation to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation, as highlighted in the reference answer."
