  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response generally aligns with the given answer, accurately describing spiritual perishing as being lost or separated from God due to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation. It also touches on the concern of exploring the implications of spiritual separation from God, highlighting the consequences of rejecting Jesus' message and living a life opposed to God's will.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more depth and biblical support for the concept of perishing spiritually. The current response is somewhat brief and lacks specific scriptural references, which would strengthen its theological foundation and credibility. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and its implications, earning it an overall grade of 80."
