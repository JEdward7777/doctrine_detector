  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the concept of \"perishing\" spiritually in the Christian context, emphasizing the idea of eternal separation from God due to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation. The explanation effectively explores the implications of spiritual separation from God by highlighting the consequences of rejecting the message of salvation and living in opposition to God's will. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on spiritual perishing."
