They touch on the themes of reconciliation, atonement, and God's love and mercy. However, the student could have further emphasized the crucial aspect of satisfying God's justice and appeasing His wrath through Jesus' sacrifice, which is essential to understanding the concept of propitiation in relation to God's justice and mercy."
