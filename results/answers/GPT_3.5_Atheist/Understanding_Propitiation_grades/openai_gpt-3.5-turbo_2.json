It accurately conveys the concept that Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice by paying the penalty for sin and appeases His wrath, while also highlighting God's mercy in providing a means for sinners to receive forgiveness and eternal life. The connection between propitiation, justice, and mercy in Christian theology is clearly articulated and supported with relevant points."
