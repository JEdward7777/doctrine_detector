The response clearly articulates how Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice by paying the penalty for sin and appeasing His wrath, while also highlighting how it demonstrates God's mercy by offering forgiveness and eternal life to sinners. The explanation is concise, coherent, and aligns well with Christian theology regarding the significance of Jesus' sacrifice."
