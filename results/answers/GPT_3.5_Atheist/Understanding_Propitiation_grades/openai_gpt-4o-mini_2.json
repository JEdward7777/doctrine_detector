It effectively demonstrates how Jesus' sacrificial death satisfied God's justice by paying the penalty for sin and appeased His wrath, while also highlighting the aspect of mercy in providing forgiveness and eternal life to sinners. The connection between justice and mercy in the concept of propitiation is well articulated and aligned with a Christian worldview."
