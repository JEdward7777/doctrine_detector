The explanation of the importance of maintaining spiritual and physical cleanliness, seeking forgiveness, and symbolic significance of renewal is well articulated. The answer could be strengthened by including specific references to Old Testament passages and connecting the concept of purification more directly to the atonement and foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice for sin. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological connections."
