However, the student could delve deeper into how these rituals specifically reflect God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin, as outlined in the concern. The reference answer, focusing on cleansing from ritual uncleanness and sin through animal sacrifices, provides a clearer Christian worldview perspective on the purpose of purification in the Old Testament."
