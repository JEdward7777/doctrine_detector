The explanation effectively connects the process of ritual purification to God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin, highlighting the importance of maintaining spiritual purity and seeking forgiveness. The response could have further emphasized the role of these rituals in pointing towards the need for a ultimate sacrificial offering to fully cleanse humanity from sin, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ."
