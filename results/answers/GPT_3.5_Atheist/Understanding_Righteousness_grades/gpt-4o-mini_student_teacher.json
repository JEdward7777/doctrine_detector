  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a decent explanation of how believers and atheists may perceive the concept of God's righteousness. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on God's absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love, which are crucial aspects of His righteousness. Encouraging the student to focus more on these attributes would improve the grade."
