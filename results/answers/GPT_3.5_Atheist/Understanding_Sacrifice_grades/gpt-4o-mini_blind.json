It effectively draws parallels between the sacrificial system in ancient Judaism and the sacrificial death of Jesus in Christian theology. The answer could be strengthened by emphasizing more on the sacrificial nature of Jesus and how His sacrifice fulfills and surpasses the Old Testament sacrificial system in providing redemption and atonement for humanity."
