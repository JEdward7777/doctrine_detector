  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the metaphor of Jesus as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to Old Testament sacrifices, drawing parallels between the sacrificial system in Judaism and Jesus' sacrificial death. The response effectively highlights themes of purity, innocence, and atonement in both contexts. However, the response could be improved by more directly linking Jesus' sacrificial role as the ultimate lamb to the necessity of a perfect and unblemished sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
