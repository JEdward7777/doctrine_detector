They also correctly point out that Satan is often depicted as a fallen angel and that he seeks to tempt and lead humanity astray. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct connection to the provided concern about understanding Satan's role in spiritual warfare. Additionally, while it is mentioned that beliefs about Satan may vary within different Christian denominations, it would be helpful to elaborate on this diversity."
