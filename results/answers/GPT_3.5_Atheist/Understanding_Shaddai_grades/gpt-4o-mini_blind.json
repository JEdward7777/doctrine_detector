It correctly highlights the idea of God's power, strength, and sovereignty associated with this name. The student could further strengthen the answer by referencing specific passages where the term \"Shaddai\" is used and elaborating on its significance in those contexts. Additionally, connecting the term to the broader theological implications of God's attributes as conveyed through this name would enhance the depth of the response."
