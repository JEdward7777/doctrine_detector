They correctly highlight its association with God's power, strength, and sovereignty. However, the response would benefit from further elaboration on the specific contexts or passages in the Old Testament where \"Shaddai\" is used, particularly as it relates to the concern of understanding God's attributes. Additionally, the origin and possible meanings of the term could be briefly mentioned."
