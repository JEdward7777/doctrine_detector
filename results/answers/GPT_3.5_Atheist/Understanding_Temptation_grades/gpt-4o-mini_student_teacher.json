  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-thought-out analysis of the story of Jesus resisting temptations from a cultural and literary perspective, their answer falls short in addressing the concern of combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. The student's atheistic worldview hinders them from fully engaging with the question from a Christian-specific perspective. The answer lacks a direct connection to how individuals can apply Jesus' strategies in their own lives as believers."
