However, the perspective given is from an atheistic standpoint, which may not fully capture the depth and significance of the spiritual aspect in combatting temptation as a follower of Christ. It does not emphasize the role of personal relationship with God and reliance on His strength through the Holy Spirit in facing temptations, which are vital components for Christians in daily spiritual battles."
