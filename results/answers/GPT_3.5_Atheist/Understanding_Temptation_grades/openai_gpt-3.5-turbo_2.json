While the scholar does not address the concern of combating temptation as a follower of Christ directly, they do acknowledge the importance of prioritizing spiritual values over material desires and remaining steadfast in one's beliefs. The response could have been strengthened by tying these insights explicitly back to the Christian worldview and offering suggestions or reflections on how Christians can draw inspiration from Jesus' example to combat temptation in their daily lives."
