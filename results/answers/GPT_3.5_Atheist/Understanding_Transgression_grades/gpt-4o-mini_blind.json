  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer effectively articulates the meaning of \"transgress\" in a Biblical context, highlighting the aspect of breaking divine rules and going against the will of God. The explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the concept. However, to improve the grade, the answer could have included specific references to Biblical passages or characters who exemplify transgressions and their consequences as outlined in the Bible. Incorporating more scriptural support would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
