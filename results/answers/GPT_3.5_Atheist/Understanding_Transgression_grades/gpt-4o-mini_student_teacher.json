  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the term \"transgress\" in a Biblical context, touching on various aspects such as the violation of divine rules, moral boundaries, and the consequences of transgressions. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the nature of sin and our relationship with God's commandments. However, there is some slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of emphasis and focus, hence the slight deduction in points."
