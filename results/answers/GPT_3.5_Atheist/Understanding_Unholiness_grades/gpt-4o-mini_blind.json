However, from a Christian worldview, the concept of \"unholy\" is rooted in sinfulness and disobedience to God's commands. The response lacks a biblical perspective on sin and holiness, and does not reference the Christian understanding of morality and ethics. It is important to emphasize the biblical view of sin and holiness when discussing characteristics of an \"unholy\" life."
