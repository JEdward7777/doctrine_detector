  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful discussion on characteristics of an \"unholy\" life from a secular perspective and offers insightful observations on societal behaviors. However, from a Christian worldview, the emphasis is on rebellion against God and dishonoring Him, which is not clearly addressed in the student's response. The focus on ethical and moral living is commendable, but the critical aspect of disobedience to God is missing. The answer could be improved by incorporating a Christian perspective on the concept of 'unholy' life."
