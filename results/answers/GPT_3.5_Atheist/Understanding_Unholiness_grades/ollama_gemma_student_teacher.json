They effectively identify ethical and social behaviors that align with this definition. The inclusion of examples of systemic oppression, corruption, and environmental exploitation showcases an awareness of the broader implications of an unholy life on society. \n\nHowever, the response would benefit from a more direct connection to the Christian worldview. The reference answer suggests that an \"unholy\" life involves rebellion against God and actions that dishonor Him. The student's answer could strengthen this connection by referencing relevant biblical passages or theological concepts that support their arguments."
