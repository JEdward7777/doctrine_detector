  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a strong explanation of what constitutes an \"unholy\" life from a secular perspective, touching on harmful behaviors and societal implications. However, it does not fully align with the Christian worldview specified in the answer, which focuses on rebellion against God and dishonoring Him. To improve the grade, the response could incorporate more explicitly Christian perspectives on sin, repentance, and redemption, highlighting the importance of aligning actions with God's will for a truly holy life."
