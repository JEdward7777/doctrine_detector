However, the Christian worldview defines unholiness as rebellion against God and actions that dishonor Him, which was not fully reflected in the response. While the answer touches on common or profane behaviors, it falls short of highlighting the spiritual implications of unholiness and the importance of aligning one's life with God's principles."
