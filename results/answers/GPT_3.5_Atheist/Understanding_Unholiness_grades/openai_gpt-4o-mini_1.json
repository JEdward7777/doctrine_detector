  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a secular viewpoint on what constitutes an \"unholy\" life, which is reasonable in a diverse society. However, from a Christian worldview, the concept of an \"unholy\" life is more focused on rebellion against God and actions that dishonor Him. While the response touched on aspects of unethical behavior, it did not address the root cause of unholiness according to Christian beliefs. A higher grade could have been achieved by incorporating more explicitly Christian perspectives on sin and repentance."
