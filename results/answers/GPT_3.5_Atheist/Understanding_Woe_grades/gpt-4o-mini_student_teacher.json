  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the term \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments, accurately noting its significance as denunciation, distress, and a warning of impending punishment. They effectively connect it to divine retribution and emphasize the need for repentance. However, the student could have elaborated further on the specific connection between woe and the consequences of sin in biblical contexts to strengthen their answer even more. Overall, a well-explained response."
