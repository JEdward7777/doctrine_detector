The student effectively contrasts worldly values with godly principles, highlighting the importance of spiritual growth and moral principles over material pursuits. However, the student could improve the response by incorporating more explicit references to the presence of evil in worldly behaviors and emphasizing the contrast with godly principles more strongly, as highlighted in the reference answer."
