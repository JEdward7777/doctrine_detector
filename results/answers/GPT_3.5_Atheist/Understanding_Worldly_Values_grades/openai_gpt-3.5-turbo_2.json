  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights the negative aspects associated with being \"worldly\" from a Christian perspective, focusing on selfishness, corruption, and ungodliness. It addresses the concern by clearly illustrating the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, emphasizing the importance of spiritual growth and moral principles over material pursuits. The only room for improvement would be to specifically mention the ultimate source of godly principles, which is God Himself."
