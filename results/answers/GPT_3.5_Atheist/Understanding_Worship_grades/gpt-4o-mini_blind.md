To worship typically refers to showing reverence, adoration, or devotion to a deity or higher power.

Worship is a central practice in many religious traditions and is seen as a way for individuals to connect with the sacred or the divine.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would give this answer a grade of 85.

The answer correctly explains that worship involves showing reverence, adoration, or devotion to a deity or higher power, and it mentions rituals, prayers, and offerings as ways of demonstrating respect. It also acknowledges the central role of worship in religious traditions and its purpose in connecting individuals with the sacred or divine.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the Christian perspective on worship, such as the importance of worshiping God alone (Exodus 20:3-5) and worshiping in spirit and truth (John 4:23-24). Including specific biblical references to support the definition of worship would enhance the grade for doctrinal correctness.
