Grade: 75

Comment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of worship as showing reverence and devotion to a deity or higher power, which aligns well with the concept of worship in Christianity. However, the answer lacks specific reference to honoring, praising, and obeying God, as highlighted in the teacher's answer. It would have been stronger if the student had included these key Christian elements of worship.
