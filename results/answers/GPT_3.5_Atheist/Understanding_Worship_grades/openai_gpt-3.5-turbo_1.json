  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise definition of worship from a Christian perspective, emphasizing honoring, praising, and obeying God through specific acts. The only slight deduction is that it could have elaborated more on how worship reflects the relationship with God in a Christian's life. Overall, a strong answer aligning well with a Christian worldview."
