  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a good overview of the significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel, touching on themes of pride, strength, and resilience. However, the response lacks depth in exploring the biblical and prophetic aspects of the term which are central to its significance within a Christian worldview. More emphasis on the theological implications and references to scripture would have greatly enhanced the answer."
