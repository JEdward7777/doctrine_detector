  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed explanation of the significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel. However, the student's response focuses more on the cultural and historical aspects rather than emphasizing the key aspect of God's affection and care for His people as highlighted in the reference answer. While the student demonstrates a good understanding of the metaphorical language used in Scripture, they could have incorporated more explicitly the aspect of God's relationship with His people in their explanation to align more closely with the Christian worldview concerns."
