It effectively connects this term to the historical and cultural significance of Jerusalem and the Jewish people, highlighting themes of pride, strength, and endurance. The response could be strengthened by directly addressing the specific concern of understanding the metaphorical language in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people. Integrating this aspect would have further emphasized the spiritual depth and significance of the term within a Christian worldview."
