  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The student offers a generally accurate comparison of Sheol and Hades in the context of the Bible and provides a basic understanding of their differences. However, the response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the Biblical significance of these concepts. Additionally, the student could have emphasized the Christian perspective on the afterlife of the righteous and unrighteous with more clarity and theological depth. Overall, a solid answer that could be improved with more detailed explanation and doctrinal insight."
