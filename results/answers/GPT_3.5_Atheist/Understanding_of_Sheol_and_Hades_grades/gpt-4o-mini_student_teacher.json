  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of Sheol and Hades in the context of the Bible, noting their cultural origins and how they relate to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. The student correctly highlights the distinctions between the two concepts and references their significance in both Jewish and Christian traditions. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the specific biblical understanding of Sheol and Hades rather than their broader cultural contexts. Additionally, further elaboration on how the fate of the righteous and unrighteous is portrayed in the Bible would strengthen the answer."
