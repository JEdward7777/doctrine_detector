  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the distinction between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death, especially highlighting the evolution of understanding from a neutral place to a more differentiated view in Christian theology. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the Christian perspective on final judgment, reward for the righteous, and punishment for the unrighteous. The integration of biblical context and Christian theology enriches the analysis, earning a high grade."
