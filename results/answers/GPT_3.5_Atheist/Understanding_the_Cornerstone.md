## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the context of the Assembly of believers, Jesus Christ is commonly referred to as the "cornerstone." This term comes from the Bible, specifically Ephesians 2:20, where it states that believers are "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."

As an atheistic scholar, it is important to approach this concept from a cultural and historical perspective. The use of the term "cornerstone" in relation to Jesus Christ symbolizes his central and foundational role in the Christian faith. Just as a cornerstone is a fundamental part of a building's structure, Jesus is seen as the key foundation upon which the beliefs and practices of Christianity are built.

Additionally, the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone emphasizes his importance in unifying believers and serving as a point of reference for their faith. Just as a cornerstone provides stability and support to a building, Jesus is believed to offer spiritual guidance, strength, and unity to the Assembly of believers.

Overall, the designation of Jesus as the "cornerstone" underscores his significance in Christian theology and highlights his pivotal role in shaping the beliefs and identity of the Christian community.
