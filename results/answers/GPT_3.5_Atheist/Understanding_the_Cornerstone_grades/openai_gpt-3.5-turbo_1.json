However, as an atheistic scholar, there is a lack of acknowledgment or engagement with the Christian worldview and the spiritual implications of Christ as the cornerstone. Therefore, while the response is well-informed from a cultural and historical perspective, it overlooks the deeper spiritual significance of Christ's role in the church and how it impacts believers' faith and community involvement."
