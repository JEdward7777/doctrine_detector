It effectively ties in the belief that Jesus, as a sinless and perfect being, will judge people based on their lives and relationship with Him. The response addresses the concern by highlighting how this belief prompts believers to reflect on the importance of their faith in Jesus and the implications of His role as judge. Great job connecting the given answer with the specified concern from a Christian worldview perspective."
