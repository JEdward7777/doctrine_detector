It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of being chosen by God in one's faith journey, linking it to the purpose of holiness and bearing spiritual fruit. The only minor improvement could be to further clarify the connection between being chosen by God and the transformative nature of this selection on an individual's faith journey."
