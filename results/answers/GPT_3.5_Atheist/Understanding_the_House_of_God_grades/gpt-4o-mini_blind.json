However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness by not emphasizing the biblical perspective exclusively when discussing the term. The Christian worldview asserts that the \"house of God\" primarily refers to a sacred place for worshiping the one true God, as described in the Bible. The answer could be improved by focusing more on the biblical significance of the term in relation to Christian beliefs."
