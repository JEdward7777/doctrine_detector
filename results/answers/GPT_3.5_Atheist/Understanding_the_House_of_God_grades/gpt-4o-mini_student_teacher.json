  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer strays significantly from the reference answer by introducing atheistic perspectives and a broad interpretation of the term \"house of God\" that diverges from the biblical context. While diversity of perspectives can be valuable in some contexts, in this case, the focus should have been on clarifying the biblical significance of the term 'house of God.' The student's answer lacks specificity and fails to maintain a Christian worldview in explaining the meaning of the term in Scripture."
