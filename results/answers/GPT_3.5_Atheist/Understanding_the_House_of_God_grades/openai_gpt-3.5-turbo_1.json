  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response correctly states the biblical perspective on the term \"house of God\" as a place of worship like the tabernacle or temple, it lacks a clear focus on the significance and meaning within Scripture. The additional information provided about atheistic perspectives and broader interpretations detract from the specific concern provided. The response would benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the biblical context and implications of the term."
