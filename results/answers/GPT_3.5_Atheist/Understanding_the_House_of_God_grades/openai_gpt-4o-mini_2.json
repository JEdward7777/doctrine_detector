  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the term \"house of God\" in a biblical context, highlighting its connection to places of worship like the tabernacle or temple. However, there is some deviation from the specified concern as the explanation expands to include atheistic perspectives and broader interpretations beyond the significance and meaning in Scripture. To improve the grade, the focus should strictly remain on addressing the concern regarding the biblical understanding of the term \"house of God.\""
