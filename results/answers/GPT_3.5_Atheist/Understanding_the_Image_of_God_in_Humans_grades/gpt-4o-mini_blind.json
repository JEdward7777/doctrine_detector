  "grade": 45.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45/100\n\nComments: The answer provided lacks a Christian viewpoint and does not align with the biblical definition of humans being created in the image of God. It primarily focuses on a secular and philosophical interpretation rather than addressing the biblical perspectives on this topic. The answer does not accurately reflect the doctrinal beliefs related to the image of God as taught in Christianity. A stronger emphasis on biblical principles and theological understanding would have improved the grade."
