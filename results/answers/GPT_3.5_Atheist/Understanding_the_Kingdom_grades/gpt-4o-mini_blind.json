However, it could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the foundational aspect of repentance and faith in Jesus Christ as central to entering and understanding the kingdom of God. Additionally, a stronger connection to the eschatological dimension of the kingdom of God as both present and future reality would deepen the analysis."
