While they touch on the idea of God's reign in human hearts and challenging oppressive systems, they could further emphasize the significance of God's sovereignty and authority in shaping believers' lives. The response could be improved by explicitly connecting the concept of the kingdom of God to God's spiritual rule and authority over all creation, as highlighted in the reference answer."
