However, it lacks depth in exploring the significance of these events within Christian theology and doctrine. The focus on skepticism and scholarly detachment detracts from a more nuanced understanding of eschatology as a core belief for Christians. The answer could benefit from incorporating more insight into the biblical foundations and doctrinal implications of the \"last days\" within Christian teachings."
