## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, judges were figures who were chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from their enemies and to lead them in times of crisis. They acted as saviors and were seen as instruments of God's deliverance for the people of Israel. 

This concept of judges as saviors provides a context for understanding Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior in the New Testament. Jesus is portrayed as the fulfillment of the role of the judges in the Old Testament, but on a much grander scale. He is not just a national deliverer, but a universal Savior who brings salvation to all people.

Just as the judges were chosen by God to rescue the Israelites from their enemies, Jesus was sent by God to rescue humanity from sin and death. His sacrificial death on the cross is seen as the ultimate act of deliverance, providing redemption and reconciliation for all who believe in him.

Therefore, the concept of judges as saviors in the Old Testament helps us to appreciate the depth and significance of Jesus' role as the ultimate Savior in the New Testament, providing a powerful and culturally retributed framework for understanding the redemptive work of Christ.
