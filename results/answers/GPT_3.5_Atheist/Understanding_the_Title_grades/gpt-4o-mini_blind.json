However, it falls short in not addressing the full theological significance of the title as it pertains to Jesus' divinity and messianic role. From a Christian worldview, the title \"Son of Man\" also points to Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, the bridge between God and humanity, and the ultimate judge of all. The answer's focus on empathy and social change, while valuable aspects of Jesus' ministry, detracts from the central doctrinal implications of the title in Christian theology."
