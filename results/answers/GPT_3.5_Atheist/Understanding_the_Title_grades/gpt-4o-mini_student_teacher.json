  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides some insight into the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in relation to Jesus' humanity and his ability to relate to human experiences. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is crucial in understanding His identity as the Messiah. Additionally, the student's answer does not fully address the implications of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' for our faith, as it primarily focuses on the human aspect of this title rather than its divine significance."
