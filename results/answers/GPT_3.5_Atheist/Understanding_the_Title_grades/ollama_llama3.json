  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nWhile the response does mention Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is a key aspect of his identity as the Son of Man, it does not delve deeply into the specific implications of this title for our faith or provide much nuance in its understanding. The concern specified is to understand the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man', but the response only scratches the surface of this topic.\n\nA higher grade would require a more comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of the Son of Man identity, including its connections to Jesus' teachings and actions, as well as its relevance to our own faith and understanding of God's relationship with humanity."
