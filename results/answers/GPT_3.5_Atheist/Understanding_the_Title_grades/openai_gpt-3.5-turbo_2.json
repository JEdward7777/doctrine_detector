  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a good explanation of the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" from a general perspective, but it did not directly address the concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' and its implications for faith from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the atheistic perspective introduced may dilute the Christian-specific interpretation of the concept. To improve the grade, the response should focus more on the implications of Jesus being the 'Son of Man' within Christian teachings and beliefs."
