## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Title.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the context of Jesus' identity, the title "Son of Man" is significant as it reflects his humanity and ties him to the broader human experience. It emphasizes Jesus' role as a figure who can relate to and empathize with the struggles, emotions, and challenges faced by all human beings. The title also has roots in the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the Book of Daniel, where it is used to refer to a heavenly figure who will be given dominion and glory by God.

From an atheistic perspective, the title "Son of Man" can be seen as a symbolic representation of Jesus as a historical figure who lived among humanity and sought to bring about social and spiritual change. It highlights Jesus' teachings and actions as being rooted in the shared human condition rather than in divine superiority or privilege. Regardless of one's religious beliefs, the concept of the "Son of Man" can serve as a reminder of the importance of empathy, compassion, and understanding in our interactions with others.
