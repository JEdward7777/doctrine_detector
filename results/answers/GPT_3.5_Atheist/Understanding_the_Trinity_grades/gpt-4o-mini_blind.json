However, it falls short in emphasizing the foundational doctrinal aspects of the Trinity according to Christian theology, such as the co-equality, co-eternality, and consubstantiality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It is important to highlight these key doctrines when discussing the Trinity to maintain doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview."
