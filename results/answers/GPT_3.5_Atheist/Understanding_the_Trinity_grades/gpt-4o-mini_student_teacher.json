  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept of the Trinity and has effectively explained it as a divine mystery beyond human comprehension. The answer is respectful of the Christian belief in the Trinity and acknowledges the complexity of God's nature. The student could have slightly elaborated on how each person of the Trinity is fully God and distinct from one another to align more closely with the reference answer. Overall, a well-written response with a strong understanding of the topic."
