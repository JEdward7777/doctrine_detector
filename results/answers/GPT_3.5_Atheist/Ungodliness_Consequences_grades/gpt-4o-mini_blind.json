  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provides a perspective from atheism, acknowledging the belief in divine consequences in various religious traditions. However, it fails to engage with the question from a Christian worldview, which is the specified context for grading. Additionally, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness and does not address the specific consequences that God pronounces on ungodly people according to Christian teachings."
