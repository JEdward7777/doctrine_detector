The concern is focused on the individual's relationship with God and the potential consequences of rejecting Him, whereas the response focuses more broadly on the beliefs surrounding divine consequences across different religious traditions. To better align with the concern, the response could explore how ungodly people may be separated from God or experience His judgment and wrath as a direct result of their disobedience."
