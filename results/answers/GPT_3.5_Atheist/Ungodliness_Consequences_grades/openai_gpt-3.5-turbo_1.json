From a Christian perspective, the rejection of God and His ways carries eternal spiritual consequences, not just as a form of retribution but as a reflection of rejecting the ultimate source of love and salvation. The concern about awareness of the spiritual ramifications is not adequately addressed in the response, as it does not acknowledge the eternal separation from God that ungodly individuals may face according to Christian beliefs."
