  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of how the term \"Holy One\" is used in both the Old and New Testaments, correctly mentioning its application to God, Jesus, and those devoted to serving God. They accurately highlight the emphasis on holiness and purity associated with the term. The explanation could have been strengthened by delving deeper into the significance of Jesus as the Holy One in the New Testament, particularly in relation to His role as the Son of God and Savior. Overall, a good response with room for a bit more depth."
