The term "Holy One" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to refer to God, Jesus, and those who are devoted to serving God. In the Old Testament, "Holy One" is often used as a title for God to emphasize His holiness and separateness from sinful humanity. For example, in the book of Isaiah, God is frequently referred to as the "Holy One of Israel" to highlight His unique and pure nature.
