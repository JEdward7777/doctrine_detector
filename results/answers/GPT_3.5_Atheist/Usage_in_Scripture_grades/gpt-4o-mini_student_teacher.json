  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how the term \"Holy One\" is used in both the Old and New Testaments, including examples and explanations for each. However, the student missed the specific emphasis on Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament, which is a crucial point in exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus. It would have been beneficial for the student to clearly highlight the unique significance of Jesus being referred to as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament to fully address the concern provided."
