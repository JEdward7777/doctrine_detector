## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
The term "Holy One" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to refer to God, Jesus, and those who are devoted to serving God. In the Old Testament, "Holy One" is often used as a title for God to emphasize His holiness and separateness from sinful humanity. For example, in the book of Isaiah, God is frequently referred to as the "Holy One of Israel" to highlight His unique and pure nature.

In the New Testament, the term "Holy One" is primarily used to refer to Jesus Christ. The angel Gabriel addresses Mary as "the Holy One" in the Gospel of Luke, recognizing her as the chosen vessel to give birth to the Son of God. Jesus is also described as the Holy One by demons in the Gospels, acknowledging His divine authority and power.

Overall, the term "Holy One" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to convey the idea of divine purity, righteousness, and authority.
