## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Atheist](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Atheist.md)
In the cultural and religious context of their time, John the Baptist and Jesus were not typically referred to as "Rabbi." The title "Rabbi" was a form of address used for Jewish teachers or scholars, particularly in the Pharisaic tradition. John the Baptist was known as a prophet and forerunner to Jesus, while Jesus himself was often addressed as "Teacher" or "Master" by his followers. However, in later Christian tradition, Jesus is sometimes referred to as "Rabbi" in a symbolic or honorary sense to acknowledge his role as a spiritual teacher and leader.
