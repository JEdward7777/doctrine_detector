  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student accurately explains the cultural and religious context of the titles \"Rabbi\" and acknowledges that John the Baptist and Jesus were not typically referred to as such during their time. The mention of Jesus being addressed as \"Teacher\" or \"Master\" is relevant. The acknowledgment of Jesus being occasionally referred to as \"Rabbi\" in later Christian tradition is also noted. The answer could be improved by including references to specific instances in the Bible where Jesus is referred to as \"Teacher\" or \"Master\" by his followers. Additionally, further elaboration on the significance of Jesus being recognized as a spiritual teacher and leader would enhance the answer."
