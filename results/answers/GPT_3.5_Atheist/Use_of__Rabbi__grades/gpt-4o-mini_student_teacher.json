  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation about the cultural and religious context regarding the title 'Rabbi' but missed mentioning that both John the Baptist and Jesus were sometimes referred to as 'Rabbi' by their disciples, demonstrating their roles as teachers. The student's answer shows a good understanding of the context but falls short in directly addressing the concern raised regarding the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings."
