Specifically, the statement \"Both John the Baptist and Jesus were sometimes called 'Rabbi' by their disciples\" is incorrect, as the response explains later in the text. This inaccuracy undermines the reader's confidence in the author's understanding of the topic.\n\nTo address this concern, it would be helpful to provide more accurate information about how Jesus and John the Baptist were addressed during their lifetimes, as well as to acknowledge the significance of these titles in the cultural and religious context of their time."
