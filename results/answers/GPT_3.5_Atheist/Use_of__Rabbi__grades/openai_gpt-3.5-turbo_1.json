However, the response did not sufficiently address the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. There was an attempt to explain why the title \"Rabbi\" was not commonly used for them, but it lacked clarity on the respect and authority that should be attributed to their teachings. More emphasis on the unique roles and teachings of John the Baptist and Jesus would have helped address the concern more effectively."
