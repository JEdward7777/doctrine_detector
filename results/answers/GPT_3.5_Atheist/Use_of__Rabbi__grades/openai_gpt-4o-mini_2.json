However, it lacks depth and does not fully explain the cultural and religious context regarding the title \"Rabbi\" and its significance. A stronger response would delve further into the differences in titles used for Jewish teachers and the symbolic implications of calling Jesus \"Rabbi\" in Christian tradition."
