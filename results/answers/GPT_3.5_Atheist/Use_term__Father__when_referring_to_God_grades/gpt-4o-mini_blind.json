  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the cultural significance of using the term \"Father\" to refer to God but fails to prioritize the doctrinal correctness of addressing God in Christian theology. The student's focus on inclusivity and gender neutrality overlooks the theological foundation of God as Father in Christian belief. A more doctrinally sound response would emphasize the scriptural basis for addressing God as Father and how this language reflects the relational nature of God as revealed in the Bible. The student could improve by incorporating a Christian-specific worldview and doctrine into their answer."
