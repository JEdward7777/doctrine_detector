However, it falls short in providing a strong defense of using the term 'Father' from a Christian perspective. The initial response could have more effectively emphasized the importance of honoring the traditional language and symbolism of God as 'Father' within Christianity, while also recognizing the value of contextual teaching to address any misunderstandings. Additionally, the suggestion of using gender-neutral or non-binary language lacks a robust theological basis within a Christian worldview, as it may depart from the biblical understanding of God as revealed in Scripture."
