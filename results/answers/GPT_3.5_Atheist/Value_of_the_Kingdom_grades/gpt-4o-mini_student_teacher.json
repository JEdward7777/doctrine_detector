  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a good response by mentioning two specific parables - the Parable of the Hidden Treasure and the Parable of the Pearl of Great Value - that Jesus used to describe the value of the kingdom of God. However, the student missed mentioning the comparison of the kingdom of God to a mustard seed and yeast as highlighted in the reference answer, which further emphasizes the transformative power of the kingdom. Overall, a solid understanding of the parables used by Jesus to illustrate the value of the kingdom of God."
