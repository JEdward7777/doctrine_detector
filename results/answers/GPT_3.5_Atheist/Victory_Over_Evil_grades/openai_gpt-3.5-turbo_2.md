In many religious and mythological traditions, including Christianity, there is the belief that the ultimate defeat of Satan is promised in various texts. For example, in the Christian tradition, Revelation 20:10 speaks of Satan being thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, which signifies his ultimate defeat and eternal punishment. This promise of Satan's defeat serves as a form of retribution for his actions and evil influence in the world. It offers believers a sense of justice and closure, knowing that evil will ultimately be vanquished and justice will prevail.
