  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theological perspective of Jesus' death and its relation to Satan's dominion. They provide a well-reasoned and evidence-based analysis, highlighting the lack of verifiable evidence for the existence of supernatural forces. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of Jesus' victory for believers and its influence on their spiritual lives."
