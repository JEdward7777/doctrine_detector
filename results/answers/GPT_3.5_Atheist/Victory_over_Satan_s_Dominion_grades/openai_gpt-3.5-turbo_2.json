It dismisses this central theological tenet as lacking empirical evidence, which overlooks the importance of faith in understanding spiritual truths. It misses the opportunity to explore how Christ's victory impacts believers' spiritual lives, which is a significant aspect of Christian worldview. A more in-depth analysis integrating Christian perspectives and addressing believers' understanding of Christ's victory would have been beneficial."
