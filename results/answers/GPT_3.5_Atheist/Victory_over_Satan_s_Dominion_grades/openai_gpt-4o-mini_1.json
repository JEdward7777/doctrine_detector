However, it lacks a Christian worldview in considering the significance of Christ's victory over sin and evil for believers and their spiritual lives. As a Christian grader, it is important to highlight the central importance of Christ's victory in terms of redemption, salvation, and the defeat of spiritual darkness in the lives of believers."
