The emphasis on atheistic and evidence-based viewpoints undermines the significance of the theological understanding of Jesus' triumph over sin and evil, missing the opportunity to explore the profound impact of this belief on individuals' faith and spiritual journey. Further engagement with Christian teachings and the transformative power of Christ's victory would have strengthened the response."
