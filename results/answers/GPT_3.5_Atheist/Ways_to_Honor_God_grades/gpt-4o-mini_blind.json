  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the response attempts to address the question from a secular perspective, it misses the mark in a Christian worldview. The answer fails to acknowledge the authority and existence of God as foundational to honoring Him. It also does not emphasize the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the means of salvation and relationship with God. Additionally, the response lacks specific references to biblical teachings and principles that guide how Christians can honor God in their daily lives."
