The suggested practical ways align well with Christian teachings and emphasize aspects like compassion, prayer, service, and living with integrity. While the response could have directly referenced the given answer more explicitly, it effectively addresses the concern by exploring actionable expressions of faith and worship in everyday life from a perspective outside of Christianity."
