  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the term \"Word of God\" according to the Bible, covering both the written scriptures and the person of Jesus Christ. Their response aligns well with the Christian worldview by acknowledging the significance of God's communication through inspired writers and Jesus as the ultimate embodiment of God's divine message. However, the student's explanation could have been slightly more concise and focused in directly addressing the significance and scope of God's communication to humanity."
