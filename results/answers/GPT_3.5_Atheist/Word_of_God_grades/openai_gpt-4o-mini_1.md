According to the Bible, the term "Word of God" encompasses multiple meanings. Primarily, it refers to the message of God as revealed in the scriptures, particularly in the Old and New Testaments. It signifies the teachings, commandments, promises, and prophecies communicated by God to humanity through inspired writers.

Additionally, in the New Testament, the term "Word of God" is often used to refer to Jesus Christ himself, as He is considered the ultimate expression and embodiment of God's divine message to humankind. In John 1:1, it says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

Therefore, the concept of the "Word of God" in the Bible encompasses both the written scriptures and the person of Jesus Christ, both of which are believed to reveal God's will and plan for humanity.
