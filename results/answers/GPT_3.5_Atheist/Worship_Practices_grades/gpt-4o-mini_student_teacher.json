  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides relevant examples of modern idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God, they approach the topic from an atheistic and sociological perspective rather than from a Christian worldview. The answer lacks the emphasis on examining one's heart and ensuring that devotion to God remains central in one's life, which is a key concern for Christians. Additionally, the answer does not explicitly address the importance of reflecting on priorities and maintaining a deep relationship with God."
