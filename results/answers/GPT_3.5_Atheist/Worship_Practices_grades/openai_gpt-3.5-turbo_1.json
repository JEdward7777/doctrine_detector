The emphasis on Christians reflecting on their priorities to ensure their faith remains central aligns well with the concern provided. However, as an atheistic scholar, the response lacks the acknowledgment of the spiritual significance and theological implications of idols in Christianity, which could have provided a deeper insight from a Christian worldview."
