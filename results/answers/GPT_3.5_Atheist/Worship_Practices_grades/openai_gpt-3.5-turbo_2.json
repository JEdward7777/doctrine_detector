However, as an atheistic scholar, the perspective offered lacks the depth of understanding that a Christian worldview would provide in analyzing the spiritual significance and consequences of idolizing worldly things. Integrating Christian teachings or referencing biblical principles related to idolatry would have enhanced the evaluation from a Christian-specific standpoint."
