  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively captures the essence of zeal in the context of Christian teachings, emphasizing enthusiasm, passion, dedication to faith, and spreading God's word. The response aligns well with the reference answer by highlighting the importance of actively promoting a good cause, obeying God, and teaching others to do the same. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the biblical context of zeal to show a deeper understanding of its origins and significance in Christianity. Overall, a solid answer with room for more depth."
