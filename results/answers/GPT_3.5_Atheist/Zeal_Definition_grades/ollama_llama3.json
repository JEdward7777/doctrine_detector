  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the correct answer, accurately describing zeal in Christian teachings as having a strong desire and actively promoting a good cause, particularly in obeying God and teaching others to do the same. The mention of \"obeying God\" shows an understanding of the biblical context of zeal.\n\nHowever, I deduct 20 points because the response does not fully address the concern about understanding the biblical context of zeal being essential for proper application in a believer's life. While it mentions obeying God, it does not explicitly state that this is crucial for applying zeal in one's life.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of zeal in Christian teachings, but could be improved by more fully addressing the concern about biblical context and its importance for application."
