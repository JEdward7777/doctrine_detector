  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of zeal in the context of Christian teachings, highlighting the importance of actively promoting a good cause in obedience to God. However, the concern raised about understanding the biblical context of zeal for proper application could have been addressed more explicitly in the response to further enhance its depth and insight. Overall, a strong response grounded in Christian principles."
