They correctly highlight its role in the atonement ritual and its symbolism in ancient Israelite religious practices. However, the student's perspective as an atheistic scholar detracts from addressing the concern of understanding the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament from a Christian worldview. The answer lacks the theological depth and spiritual significance that a Christian perspective would emphasize in interpreting the atonement lid."
