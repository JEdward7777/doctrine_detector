However, the response also includes a secular perspective as an atheistic scholar, which may not align with a Christian worldview that views the Old Testament as revealing God's character and plan for salvation. In evaluating from a Christian perspective, it's important to emphasize the theological significance of atonement and God's mercy as foundational to the Christian faith."
