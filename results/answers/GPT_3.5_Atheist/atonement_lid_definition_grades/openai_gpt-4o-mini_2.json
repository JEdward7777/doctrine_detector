However, the response could have further emphasized the Christian perspective on atonement and how it foreshadows Christ's ultimate sacrifice for the redemption of humanity. Additionally, as a Christian worldview, it is important to acknowledge the spiritual significance and fulfillment of the atonement lid in Jesus Christ rather than solely focusing on its historical and cultural context."
