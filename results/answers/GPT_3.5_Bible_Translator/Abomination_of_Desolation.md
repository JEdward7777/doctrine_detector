The "abomination of desolation" mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24:15 refers to a future event that will signal the beginning of the great tribulation. This phrase comes from the book of Daniel in the Old Testament, specifically in Daniel 9:27 and Daniel 11:31, where it is associated with a desecration of the temple in Jerusalem.

Jesus uses this terminology to warn his disciples about a time of great upheaval and persecution that will come upon believers before his return. The abomination of desolation is said to be something abhorrent and sacrilegious that will be set up in the holy place, defiling it and signaling the need for believers to flee and seek refuge.

Ultimately, the abomination of desolation is a sign of the end times and a reminder for Christians to be vigilant, faithful, and prepared for the coming of the Son of Man. It serves as a warning to stay true to the faith and to be watchful for the signs of the times.
