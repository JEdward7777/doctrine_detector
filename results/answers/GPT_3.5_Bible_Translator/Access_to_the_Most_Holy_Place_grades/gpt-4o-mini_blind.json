The student effectively conveys the importance of the restriction and its symbolic significance in highlighting the holiness of God and the need for atonement due to sin. The connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest and mediator is well articulated. The only minor improvement could be to further emphasize the role of the Day of Atonement as a specific event in the Old Testament ritual, and perhaps delve into the role of the Tabernacle's construction as a physical representation of the separation between humanity and God."
