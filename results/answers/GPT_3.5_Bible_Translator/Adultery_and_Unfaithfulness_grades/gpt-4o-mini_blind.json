  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85. \n\nThe student accurately explains both the literal and symbolic connections between the term \"unfaithful\" and marriage as described in the Bible. They correctly portray how being unfaithful in marriage goes against the biblical understanding of marriage as a lifelong commitment between one man and one woman. Additionally, the student aptly connects the concept of being unfaithful in marriage to the relationship between God and His people, showcasing the metaphorical significance of fidelity. \n\nThere is sound doctrinal correctness in the answer, emphasizing the importance of commitment, loyalty, and fidelity in both earthly relationships and our relationship with God. However, to elevate this response, the student could have incorporated more specific biblical references to support their points. Such references would strengthen the theological foundation of their argument and provide additional depth to their analysis."
