# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "unfaithful" is related to the concept of marriage in the Bible in both a literal and symbolic sense. In a literal sense, being "unfaithful" in marriage refers to breaking the marriage covenant through actions such as adultery or abandonment. This is prohibited in the Bible as it goes against the design and purpose of marriage, which is meant to be a lifelong commitment between one man and one woman.

Symbolically, the concept of being "unfaithful" in the context of marriage can be used to illustrate the relationship between God and His people. Throughout the Bible, God is often depicted as the faithful husband and His people as the bride. When His people turn away from Him and worship other gods or idols, they are described as being unfaithful or committing spiritual adultery. This highlights the importance of remaining loyal and devoted to God, just as a spouse should be faithful to their partner in marriage.

Overall, the term "unfaithful" in the context of marriage serves as a reminder of the importance of commitment, loyalty, and fidelity in both earthly relationships and one's relationship with God.
