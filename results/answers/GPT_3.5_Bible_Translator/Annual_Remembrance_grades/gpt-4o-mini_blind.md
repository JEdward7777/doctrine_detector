In the Bible, the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year to remember and commemorate the event when God delivered them from slavery in Egypt. The Passover was instituted as a way for the Israelites to remember how God spared the lives of their firstborn children when He passed over the homes marked with the blood of a sacrificed lamb during the final plague in Egypt (Exodus 12:1-14).

The celebration of Passover served several important purposes for the Israelites:
1. To Remember God's Deliverance: Passover was a time for the Israelites to remember and give thanks for God's miraculous deliverance from slavery in Egypt. It was a reminder of God's faithfulness and His power to save His people.

2. To Pass on Faith to Future Generations: By celebrating Passover annually, the Israelites were able to pass on the story of God's deliverance to future generations. It served as a way to teach children about their history and faith in God.

3. To Renew Covenant Relationship: Passover was a time for the Israelites to renew their covenant relationship with God. It reminded them of their dependence on God and their commitment to following His commands.

Overall, the celebration of Passover was a significant part of the Israelites' religious and cultural identity, serving as a reminder of God's faithfulness, deliverance, and covenant relationship with His people.
