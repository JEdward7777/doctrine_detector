3. To Renew Covenant Relationship: Passover was a time for the Israelites to renew their covenant relationship with God. It reminded them of their dependence on God and their commitment to following His commands.

Overall, the celebration of Passover was a significant part of the Israelites' religious and cultural identity, serving as a reminder of God's faithfulness, deliverance, and covenant relationship with His people.
