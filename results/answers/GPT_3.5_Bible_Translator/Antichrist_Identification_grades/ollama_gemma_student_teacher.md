**Comment:** The student's answer accurately identifies the core elements of an antichrist according to John's epistle. They clearly reference the specific verses and clearly articulate the denial of Jesus' divinity as the defining characteristic. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the nature of deception involved in antichrist teachings.
