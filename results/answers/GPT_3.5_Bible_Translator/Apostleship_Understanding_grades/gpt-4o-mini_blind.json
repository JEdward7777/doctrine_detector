It correctly identifies the authority and empowerment given to the apostles, their role in fulfilling Old Testament prophecies, and their contribution to establishing the early Christian church. The response could be further improved by delving deeper into the specific biblical passages relevant to the sending of the apostles and connecting these points back to Jesus' overarching mission and teachings. Additionally, emphasizing the essential role of the Holy Spirit in equipping and guiding the apostles would enhance the doctrinal depth of the explanation."
