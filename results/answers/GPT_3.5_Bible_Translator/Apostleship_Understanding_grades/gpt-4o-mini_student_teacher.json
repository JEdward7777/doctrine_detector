  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and detailed response that effectively explains the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the gospel. They highlighted key aspects such as authority, empowerment, fulfilling prophecy, and the role in establishing the early church. The response aligns closely with the reference answer, but could have been more concise in certain parts and focused on directly addressing the concern of the apostleship in the context of the Great Commission."
