  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response an 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of the apostles' role in spreading the gospel, and it highlights the authority and empowerment given to them by Jesus. The writer also correctly notes that the sending of the apostles was crucial for the establishment and expansion of the early church. Additionally, the response provides some biblical context, mentioning Old Testament prophecies and the fulfillment of God's plan of salvation.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because this response does not explicitly address the concern about understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission. While the writer mentions that the sending of the apostles was \"crucial for the establishment and expansion of the early church,\" they do not specifically relate this to the Great Commission or explain how the apostles' mission fits into Jesus' command to his disciples to go and make disciples.\n\nOverall, I would give this response an 85 because it demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of the apostles' role in spreading the gospel, but could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern about understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission."
