It effectively connects the mission of the apostles to the broader theological implications of fulfilling God's plan of salvation and establishing the early Christian church. The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the role of apostleship in spreading the gospel message and carrying out the authority granted by Jesus. Well done!"
