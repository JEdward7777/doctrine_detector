In the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant was located in the most holy place, also known as the Holy of Holies. This inner chamber of the tabernacle was separated by a veil, and only the high priest could enter this sacred space once a year on the Day of Atonement to make atonement for the sins of the people. The ark of the covenant contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments, a golden urn holding manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with the Israelites.
