## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian, I believe that assurance is given to those who believe in Jesus based on the promises of God's Word, the Bible. One key assurance is found in John 3:16, which states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

Additionally, Romans 8:1 assures us that "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." This means that believers in Jesus are forgiven of their sins and are no longer under the judgment of God.

Furthermore, 1 John 5:13 says, "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life." This verse highlights the confidence that believers can have in knowing that they have eternal life through faith in Jesus.

Overall, the assurance given to those who believe in Jesus is that they are saved, forgiven, and have eternal life with God. This assurance is based on the unchanging promises and faithfulness of God.
