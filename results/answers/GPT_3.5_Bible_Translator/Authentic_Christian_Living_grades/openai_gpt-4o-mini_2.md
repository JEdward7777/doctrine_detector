In Romans 12:9, the apostle Paul writes, "Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good." This verse highlights the importance of having authentic, genuine love that is not hypocritical. To avoid hypocrisy in our love and actions, we are called to have a sincere and genuine love for others, to abhor evil, and to hold fast to that which is good. This means our love should not merely be a facade or for show, but it should come from a pure heart that is genuinely seeking the good of others and reflecting the love of Christ.
