  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of divine authority, accurately describing it as \"the power and right that comes from God\" guiding believers in their moral and spiritual decisions. The concern about discerning God's will and maintaining obedience is also well-addressed, highlighting the significance of acknowledging divine authority for believers.\n\nWhile the response could be more detailed and nuanced, particularly in exploring the biblical basis for divine authority, it provides a clear and concise overview of this important concept. With some additional development and support from Scripture, this response has great potential to inspire and encourage readers in their faith journey."
