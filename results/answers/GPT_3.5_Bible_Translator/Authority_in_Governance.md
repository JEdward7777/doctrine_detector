## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that governing authorities are established by God and are in a position of authority over their citizens. In Romans 13:1-7, the Apostle Paul writes that "everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God. So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished." This passage emphasizes the importance of respecting and obeying governing authorities, as they are ultimately accountable to God for their actions.

However, it is also important to note that governing authorities are expected to rule justly and in accordance with God's laws. In Proverbs 29:4, it is written, "By justice kings give a country stability, but those who are greedy for bribes tear it down." This highlights the responsibility of rulers to govern with integrity and righteousness, rather than for selfish gain or corrupt purposes.

Overall, the biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers over their citizens is that it is ordained by God and should be respected and obeyed, but also that rulers are accountable to God for how they exercise their authority.
