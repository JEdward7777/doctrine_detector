  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a solid analysis of the biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers over their citizens. The student effectively references relevant Bible verses, such as Romans 13:1-7 and Proverbs 29:4, to support their points. The emphasis on the dual aspect of respecting authority while also highlighting the importance of just and righteous governance aligns well with Christian doctrine. The response could be enhanced by inclusion of additional scripture references or theological analysis, but overall it demonstrates a strong understanding and application of biblical teachings on this topic."
