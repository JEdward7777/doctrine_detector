## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The authority of the apostles was directly related to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. In the Bible, we see that Jesus gave authority to the apostles to cast out demons, heal the sick, and preach the gospel (Matthew 10:1, Mark 3:14-15). This authority came from Jesus himself, who bestowed it upon them to carry out the work of spreading the good news of the kingdom of God.

The apostles' ability to perform miracles was a sign to the people that they were indeed sent by God and were speaking with His authority. It authenticated their message and demonstrated the power of God at work through them. This is especially evident in the book of Acts, where we read about the apostles performing miracles such as healing the sick, raising the dead, and speaking in tongues.

Furthermore, the apostles preached boldly because they were filled with the Holy Spirit, who empowered them to proclaim the gospel fearlessly. Despite facing opposition, persecution, and even death, the apostles continued to boldly proclaim the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. Their authority and boldness came from their close relationship with Jesus and their obedience to His commission to go and make disciples of all nations.

In summary, the authority of the apostles was closely tied to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. These miraculous signs validated their message and demonstrated the power of God at work through them, while their boldness in preaching was fueled by the Holy Spirit and their unwavering faith in Jesus Christ.
