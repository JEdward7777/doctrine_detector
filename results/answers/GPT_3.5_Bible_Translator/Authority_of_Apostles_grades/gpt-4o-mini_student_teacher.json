  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively links the authority of the apostles to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. They accurately reference biblical examples and explain how the apostles' authority was derived from Jesus. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the divine empowerment bestowed upon the apostles for ministry. However, a slight deduction is made for the lack of direct mention of the apostles being empowered by God, as stated in the reference answer. Nonetheless, the explanation is clear, articulate, and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
