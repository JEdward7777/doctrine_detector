  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response effectively explores the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, highlighting their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly as a direct result of Jesus' commission. The writer provides clear biblical support (Matthew 10:1, Mark 3:14-15) and uses Acts as an example of the apostles' miraculous signs validating their message.\n\nThe response also correctly identifies the Holy Spirit's role in empowering the apostles to preach fearlessly, despite facing opposition. The summary effectively recapitulates the main points made throughout the response.\n\nTo reach a perfect score (100), this response could benefit from more explicit connection-making between the apostles' authority and their relationship with Jesus Christ. Additionally, some minor adjustments in sentence structure and wording would help to enhance clarity and flow.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively explores the concern of divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry."
