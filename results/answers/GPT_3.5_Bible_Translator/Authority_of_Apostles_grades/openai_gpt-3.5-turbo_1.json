It effectively integrates scriptural references and highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering the apostles for ministry. The explanation aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of the apostles' closeness to Jesus and their obedience to His commission. Great job in addressing the concern in depth and with clarity."
