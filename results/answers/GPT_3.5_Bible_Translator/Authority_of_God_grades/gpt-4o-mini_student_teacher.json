  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively explains the significance of the term \"Yahweh of hosts\" in highlighting God's authority over spiritual beings. They correctly identify the term as emphasizing God's sovereign power over angels and heavenly beings. The student's response aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing God's supremacy and control over all realms. The answer could have been strengthened by directly referencing God's role as the ruler of heavenly armies and all creation, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept within a Christian context."
