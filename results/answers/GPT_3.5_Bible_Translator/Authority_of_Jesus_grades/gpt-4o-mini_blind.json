  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of how the title \"King of the Jews\" demonstrates Jesus' authority over all creation. The student effectively connects Jesus' royal lineage, divine authority, and role as Messiah to his sovereignty over not just the Jewish people but all nations and creation. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses strengthens the argument. However, the response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications of Jesus' kingship over creation and providing a more in-depth analysis. Additionally, incorporating more scriptural references could further support the points made."
