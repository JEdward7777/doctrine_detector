## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Biblical basis for parental authority over children can be found in various scriptures throughout the Bible. Here are a few key verses that illustrate this concept:

1. Ephesians 6:1-4 - "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—which is the first commandment with a promise—'so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.' Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord." This passage highlights the importance of children obeying their parents and parents raising their children in a loving and godly manner.

2. Proverbs 22:6 - "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it." Parents have a responsibility to teach and guide their children in the ways of the Lord, instilling values and principles that will help shape their character and behavior.

3. Colossians 3:20-21 - "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged." This verse emphasizes the importance of children obeying their parents and parents not provoking their children to anger or discouragement.

Overall, parental authority over children is rooted in the biblical teachings on love, discipline, and guidance within the family unit. Parents are called to lead and nurture their children in a way that reflects God's love and truth, ultimately pointing them towards a relationship with Him.
