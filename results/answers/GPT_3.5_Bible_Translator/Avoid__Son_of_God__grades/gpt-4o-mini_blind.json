The emphasis on faithfully communicating the original meaning of the text and offering contextual explanations is commendable. However, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing the foundational Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the unique Son of God, distinct from any polytheistic connotations. Overall, a solid response with room for a bit more assertiveness in affirming the doctrinal truth of the term \"Son of God.\""
