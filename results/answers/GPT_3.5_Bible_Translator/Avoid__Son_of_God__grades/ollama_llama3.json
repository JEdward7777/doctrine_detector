  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern about avoiding the term \"Son of God\" and its potential consequences. The writer correctly argues that providing explanations or contextual notes can help readers understand the intended meaning of the term within the Christian faith, rather than avoiding it altogether. This approach acknowledges the importance of cultural sensitivity while also preserving theological truth.\n\nThe response's alignment with the given answer is excellent, as it explicitly states that the term should not be avoided but rather carefully taught through context and explanation. The writer's conclusion about the goal of Bible translation also aligns well with the concern, emphasizing the need to faithfully communicate the message of the original text while preserving theological truth.\n\nThe only aspect where the response could improve is in providing more specific examples or strategies for teaching the meaning of \"Son of God\" in different cultural contexts. However, overall, this response provides a thoughtful and biblically-grounded approach to addressing the concern about avoidance."
