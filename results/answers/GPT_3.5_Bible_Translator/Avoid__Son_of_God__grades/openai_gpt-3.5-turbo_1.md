As a Christian Bible translator, it is important to accurately convey the original meaning of the text while also being sensitive to the cultural context in which it will be read. The term "Son of God" is a central aspect of Christian theology and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to Jesus Christ's divine nature and relationship with God the Father. 

While it is essential to consider how certain terms may be understood in different cultural and religious contexts, it is not necessary to avoid using the term "Son of God" in translations. Instead, translators can provide explanations or contextual notes to help readers better understand the intended meaning of the term within the Christian faith.

Ultimately, the goal of Bible translation is to faithfully communicate the message of the original text in a way that is clear and understandable to the target audience, while also preserving the theological truth of the Scriptures.
