The explanations are clear and show an understanding of the differences between believer's baptism, infant baptism, and the symbolism versus sacramental views of baptism. However, the mention of baptism by pouring or sprinkling not being explicitly mentioned in the Bible could be elaborated on further to clarify the theological differences between immersion and those methods. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the foundational importance of baptism in Christian theology and its connection to salvation and discipleship could enhance the response. Overall, a solid explanation but could benefit from deeper theological insights."
