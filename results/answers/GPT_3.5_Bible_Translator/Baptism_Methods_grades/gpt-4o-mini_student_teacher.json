  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 85.\n\nThe student did a good job of outlining the different methods of baptism mentioned in the Bible and providing explanations for each method. They also addressed various interpretations of baptism within different Christian traditions. However, the student could have slightly expanded on how these interpretations align with specific biblical passages or theological beliefs to strengthen their argument further. Overall, this response shows a solid understanding of the topic with room for a bit more depth in connecting interpretations to biblical foundations.\n"
