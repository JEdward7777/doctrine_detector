The inclusion of key examples and distinctions between believer's baptism, infant baptism, and differing views on baptism as a symbol versus a sacrament demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective. The response effectively conveys the diversity in baptism practices while emphasizing the spiritual significance behind the act. Great job!"
