They accurately highlighted key points such as baptism being a public declaration of faith, a symbolic act of identification with Christ, and an act of obedience to God's command. Additionally, they supported their points with relevant scripture references. The response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the sacramental nature of baptism within Christian tradition and emphasizing the role of baptism in the believer's incorporation into the body of Christ."
