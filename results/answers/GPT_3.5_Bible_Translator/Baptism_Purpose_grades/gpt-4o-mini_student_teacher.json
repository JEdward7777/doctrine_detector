  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the significance of baptism in the life of a Christian according to New Testament teachings. They referenced relevant Bible verses to support their points and highlighted the importance of baptism as a public declaration of faith, identification with Christ's death and resurrection, and obedience to God's command. However, the student could have further emphasized the aspect of being cleansed from sin and united with Christ, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher."
