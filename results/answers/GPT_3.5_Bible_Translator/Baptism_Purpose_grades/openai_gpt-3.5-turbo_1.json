It explains that baptism is not just a symbolic act but also an act of obedience and a public declaration of faith. The emphasis on baptism as a demonstration of one's identification with Christ's death and resurrection aligns well with Christian teachings on the sacrament. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of baptism within the Christian worldview."
