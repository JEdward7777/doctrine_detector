The student accurately discussed the role of repentance as acknowledging the need for forgiveness and turning towards God, linking it to the act of baptism as a public declaration of faith. While the teacher's reference answer succinctly stated the key point, the student's response expanded on the concept effectively with supporting references and explanations. Well done!"
