## [Answer](../Baptism_and_Repentance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, repentance and baptism are closely linked together as important components of the process of becoming a follower of Jesus Christ.

Repentance is the act of turning away from sin, changing one's mind and heart towards God, and seeking forgiveness for past wrongdoings. It is an essential step in the process of salvation and becoming a disciple of Jesus. In the book of Acts, Peter preached to the crowd on the day of Pentecost, saying, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).

Baptism, on the other hand, is the outward expression of an inward decision to follow Jesus. It symbolizes the washing away of sin and the new life that comes through faith in Christ. In the New Testament, we see that new believers were often baptized as a public declaration of their faith and commitment to Jesus. In Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus instructed his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

So, repentance prepares the heart for baptism by acknowledging the need for forgiveness and turning towards God, while baptism is the public declaration and symbol of that repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. Both are important elements in the journey of faith and the process of salvation according to the New Testament.
