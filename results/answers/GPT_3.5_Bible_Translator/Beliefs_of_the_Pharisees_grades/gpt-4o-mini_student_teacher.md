## [Answer](../Beliefs_of_the_Pharisees.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Pharisees, a Jewish religious group during the time of Jesus, believed in the resurrection of the dead and in the existence of spiritual beings such as angels and demons. Regarding life after death, the Pharisees held to the belief in the resurrection of the righteous to eternal life and the wicked to judgment. This belief differs from the Sadducees, another Jewish sect at the time, who denied the resurrection and believed that there was no afterlife.

In terms of spiritual beings, the Pharisees believed in the existence of angels as messengers and servants of God, as depicted in various passages in the Hebrew Bible. They also acknowledged the presence of demons as evil spiritual beings that could influence individuals and were in opposition to God.

Overall, the Pharisees' beliefs about life after death and spiritual beings were foundational in shaping their worldview and understanding of God's plan for humanity.
