  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response with relevant Bible verses emphasizing the importance of forgiveness among individuals. The verses cited align well with the concern provided and reflect the Christian principle of forgiveness as modeled by God. However, the references in the teacher's answer were more concise and directly related to the concern, hence the slight deduction in points. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated in the student's answer."
