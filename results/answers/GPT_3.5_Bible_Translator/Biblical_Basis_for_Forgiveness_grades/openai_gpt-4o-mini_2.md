Comment: The response provides a strong selection of relevant Bible verses that support the practice of forgiveness among believers. It effectively identifies key verses and articulates the importance of forgiveness in line with a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could have been directly addressing the concern by explicitly mentioning Luke 17:3-4, which specifically speaks to forgiving others as an essential practice among believers.
