The connection made to Jesus' example of service is commendable and aligns well with Christian principles. The response could have been strengthened with a deeper exploration of the servant leadership aspect and the importance of humility in fulfilling the role of a deacon. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound answer. Great effort!"
