## [Answer](../Biblical_Context.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the responsibilities of deacons are described primarily in 1 Timothy 3:8-13. Deacons are to be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. They are to hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. Deacons are also to be tested first and then be found blameless. They should be the husband of one wife, managing their children and households well.

Additionally, deacons are to be servants of the church, helping to meet the practical needs of the congregation and supporting the work of the elders in caring for the spiritual well-being of the church members. Overall, deacons are called to serve with integrity, humility, and a heart for helping others, following the example of Jesus who came not to be served, but to serve (Mark 10:45).
