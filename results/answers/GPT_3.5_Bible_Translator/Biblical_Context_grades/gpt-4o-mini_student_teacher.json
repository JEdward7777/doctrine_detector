  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive description of the responsibilities of deacons as outlined in the New Testament, highlighting their character qualities and role in serving the church community. However, the student did not explicitly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, which was the main focus of the given reference answer. Encouragement to directly connect the responsibilities of deacons to the specific concern provided would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
