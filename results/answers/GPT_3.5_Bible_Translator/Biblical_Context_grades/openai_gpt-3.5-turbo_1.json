  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, emphasizing their roles in serving the church community with integrity and humility. However, it lacks specificity in addressing the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as it mainly focuses on the general responsibilities of deacons. Integrating more examples or specific references from Scripture related to fair treatment could have strengthened the response further."
