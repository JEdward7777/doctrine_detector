The passage highlights Jesus' willingness to set aside his divine glory and take on human form to serve others, which is a powerful illustration of humility. The writer also effectively connects this example to the importance of serving with a humble heart, which aligns with the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in scripture.\n\nWhile the response does not directly address the original answer (\"David is an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God\"), it does provide a different biblical example that still addresses the concern. However, the connection to the original answer could be made more explicit to strengthen the response."
