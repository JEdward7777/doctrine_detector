## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
One biblical example of a character who exemplified humility is Jesus Christ himself. In Philippians 2:5-8, it says that Jesus, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.

Jesus, the Son of God, willingly set aside his divine glory and took on human form to serve others and ultimately sacrifice himself for the salvation of humanity. His humility is evident throughout his earthly ministry, as he consistently prioritized the needs of others above his own and taught his disciples to do the same. Jesus' example of humility serves as a model for all Christians to follow in putting others before ourselves and serving with a humble heart.
