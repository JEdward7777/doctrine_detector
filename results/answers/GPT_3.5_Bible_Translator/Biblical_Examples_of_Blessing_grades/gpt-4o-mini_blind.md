Comment: 
This response accurately identifies and references a specific example from the Bible where God blesses creation, which is commendable. The student provides the relevant verse from Genesis 1:22 and explains the context of God's blessing upon aquatic creatures and birds for reproduction and abundance. The explanation could be more detailed and elaborate on the significance of God's blessing in this context to enhance the overall depth of the response. Nevertheless, the foundational understanding and application of the biblical example are clear and doctrinally correct. Well done.
