  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written response that clearly identifies the relevant verse in Genesis 1:22 and explains how it demonstrates God's blessing upon creation. The student accurately interprets the verse and connects it to the concept of abundance and reproduction. However, it would benefit from a deeper exploration of the broader context of God's blessing on creation in the Bible."
