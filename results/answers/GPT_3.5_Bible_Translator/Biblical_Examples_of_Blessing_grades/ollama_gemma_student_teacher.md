One example from the Bible where God blesses creation is found in Genesis 1:22, which says, "And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.'" This verse refers to the creation of aquatic creatures and birds on the fifth day of creation, showing that God's blessing was upon them for reproduction and abundance.

**Comment:** This is a well-written response that clearly identifies the relevant verse in Genesis 1:22 and explains how it demonstrates God's blessing upon creation. The student accurately interprets the verse and connects it to the concept of abundance and reproduction. However, it would benefit from a deeper exploration of the broader context of God's blessing on creation in the Bible.
