## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly. In the story of Jesus' trial and crucifixion, we see several examples of innocence and injustice.

1. Jesus before Pilate: In Matthew 27:11-14, Pilate questions Jesus but finds no fault in Him. He states, "I find no basis for a charge against this man." Despite the accusations brought against Him by the religious leaders, Pilate acknowledges Jesus' innocence.

2. Barabbas released: In Matthew 27:15-26, Pilate offers to release either Jesus or Barabbas, a notorious criminal. The crowd chooses to release Barabbas and have Jesus crucified, even though Pilate again declares Jesus' innocence.

3. Jesus responds to accusations: Throughout His trial, Jesus remains silent or responds with words of truth and grace, showing His innocence and submission to God's will. In Matthew 26:63-64, when asked if He is the Son of God, Jesus replies, "You have said so."

4. The centurion's declaration: After Jesus dies on the cross, the centurion overseeing the crucifixion exclaims, "Surely this man was the Son of God!" (Matthew 27:54). This statement acknowledges Jesus' innocence and divine nature.

These examples highlight the theme of innocence in Jesus' trial and crucifixion, emphasizing His sinlessness and the unjust accusations brought against Him by His accusers.
