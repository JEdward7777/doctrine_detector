  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of examples from Scripture that illustrate Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. They accurately identified key moments in Jesus' trial and crucifixion, showcasing His innocence through various interactions and responses. However, the student could have included a more explicit reference to the soldier's recognition of Jesus' innocence (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic with well-explained examples."
