  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of innocence in Jesus' trial and crucifixion, referencing relevant biblical passages to support their claims. The examples provided are well-chosen and clearly illustrate the idea of Jesus' sinlessness in the face of false accusations. However, the response could benefit from including additional supporting evidence from Scripture to strengthen the arguments presented."
