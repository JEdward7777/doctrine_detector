The examples cited align well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the theme of innocence in Jesus' trial and crucifixion. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian belief in Jesus' sinlessness and the unjust nature of the accusations brought against Him. Great job in providing relevant biblical references to support the contentions made."
