## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
One key example from the Bible that illustrates the concept of mercy is found in the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15:11-32. In this parable, a father shows great mercy and forgiveness to his son who had squandered his inheritance through reckless living. Despite the son's failures and poor choices, the father eagerly welcomes him back with open arms, demonstrating unconditional love and mercy.

Another example is seen in the story of King David and Mephibosheth in 2 Samuel 9. King David shows mercy and kindness to Mephibosheth, the crippled grandson of his former enemy Saul, by inviting him to eat at the king's table and restoring to him all the land that belonged to his grandfather. This act of mercy reflects God's grace and kindness towards us, even when we do not deserve it.

Additionally, the story of the woman caught in adultery in John 8:1-11 highlights Jesus' mercy and compassion. Instead of condemning the woman, as the religious leaders wanted, Jesus shows her mercy by forgiving her sins and encouraging her to go and sin no more.

These examples demonstrate that God's mercy is offered freely to all who seek forgiveness and redemption, regardless of their past mistakes or shortcomings.
