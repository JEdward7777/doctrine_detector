  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has effectively highlighted key examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy. The references to the parable of the prodigal son, King David and Mephibosheth, and the woman caught in adultery are all appropriate and well-explained. The student effectively conveys the message of God's abundant mercy and forgiveness towards humanity. However, further elaboration and deeper theological insights could enhance the depth of the response."
