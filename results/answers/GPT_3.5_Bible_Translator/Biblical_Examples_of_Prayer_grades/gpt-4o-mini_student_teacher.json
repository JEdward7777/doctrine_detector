  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from the Bible that illustrate the power and importance of prayer. The examples chosen effectively demonstrate how prayer can lead to protection, strength, miraculous interventions, and guidance from God. However, the student could improve by incorporating the teacher's reference answer examples as well to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Overall, a strong response with room for enhancement."
