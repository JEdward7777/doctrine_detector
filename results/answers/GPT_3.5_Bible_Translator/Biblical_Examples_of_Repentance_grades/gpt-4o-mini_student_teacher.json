  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided examples of repentance from the Bible and discussed their significance within the Christian faith, they missed some specific references that the teacher included in the reference answer. It is important for believers to learn from these specific Biblical examples to fully understand the depth and practical application of repentance in their own lives. The student did well in explaining the concept of repentance and its importance but could have improved by providing more concise and specific examples as outlined in the teacher's reference answer."
