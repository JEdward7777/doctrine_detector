  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively references key Biblical passages that illustrate the concept of transgression, including Romans 3:23, 1 John 3:4, and Romans 5:12. The student correctly highlights the universality of human sinfulness, the definition of sin as disobedience to God's law, and the entry of sin into the world through Adam. The conclusion on the need for redemption through Jesus Christ is also well-stated. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound answer. Great job!"
