## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Transgression.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
One notable Biblical reference that illustrates the concept of transgression is found in Romans 3:23, which states, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." This verse highlights the universal reality of human transgression or sinfulness.

Another key passage that addresses transgression is 1 John 3:4, which defines sin as "lawlessness" or "breaking God's law." This emphasizes the idea that transgression involves disobeying God's commands and going against His will.

Additionally, Romans 5:12 explains how sin entered the world through one man, Adam, and as a result, all humans are born into a state of sin and transgression.

These references emphasize the pervasive nature of transgression in human experience and the need for redemption and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.
