## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Transgression.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
One notable Biblical reference that illustrates the concept of transgression is found in Romans 3:23, which states, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." This verse highlights the universal reality of human transgression or sinfulness.

Another key passage that addresses transgression is 1 John 3:4, which defines sin as "lawlessness" or "breaking God's law." This emphasizes the idea that transgression involves disobeying God's commands and going against His will.

Additionally, Romans 5:12 explains how sin entered the world through one man, Adam, and as a result, all humans are born into a state of sin and transgression.

These references emphasize the pervasive nature of transgression in human experience and the need for redemption and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The student does provide some relevant Biblical references that address the concept of transgression, including Romans 3:23, 1 John 3:4, and Romans 5:12. These references are important for understanding the nature of sin and human fallenness, which is a crucial aspect of Christian theology.

However, the response could be strengthened by more explicitly drawing connections between these Biblical examples and the concern about learning from them to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life. The student does not directly address this concern, instead focusing primarily on summarizing the relevant passages.

To improve, the student could have provided a clearer explanation of how these Biblical examples can be applied to their own life, or how they might learn from these examples to avoid sin and live a more righteous life. Nevertheless, the response does demonstrate some understanding of the concept of transgression and its importance in Christian theology.
