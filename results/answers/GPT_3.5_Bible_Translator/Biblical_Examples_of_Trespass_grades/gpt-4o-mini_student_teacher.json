  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided thorough examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of trespass and the moral or spiritual lessons learned from them. However, the student missed incorporating the specific references provided in the reference answer from the teacher. Including those references would have strengthened the answer and connected it more directly to the concern of understanding the implications of actions and God's forgiveness."
