  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The response accurately identifies an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship by referencing the incident of the golden calf in Exodus 32. The student effectively explains the context and contrasts between idol worship and true worship in this narrative. However, the response could have been strengthened by including specific references to certain verses or passages within Exodus 32 to provide more depth and clarity to the explanation. Overall, a solid answer with room for minor improvements."
