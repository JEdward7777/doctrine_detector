  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid response by referencing the incident with the golden calf in Exodus 32 to demonstrate the negative contrast between true worship and idol worship. However, the teacher's reference answer from Exodus 20:3 directly addresses the concern raised regarding the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. The student's answer was on the right track but could have been stronger by directly citing the verse provided in the reference answer."
