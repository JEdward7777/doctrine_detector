## Question [Biblical Examples of Worship](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md)
Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

## Correct Answer
One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship is found in the book of Exodus. In Exodus 32, we see the Israelites turning away from worshiping the true God and instead constructing a golden calf to worship. This act of idol worship is contrasted with the true worship of God, as represented by Moses and the faithful remnant who continue to worship the Lord. God's response to the idolatry of the Israelites demonstrates the seriousness of turning away from true worship and placing idols above Him.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a solid response by referencing the incident with the golden calf in Exodus 32 to demonstrate the negative contrast between true worship and idol worship. However, the teacher's reference answer from Exodus 20:3 directly addresses the concern raised regarding the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. The student's answer was on the right track but could have been stronger by directly citing the verse provided in the reference answer.
