The reference to Exodus 20:3 effectively supports the argument, illustrating the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. This analysis aligns well with a Christian worldview emphasizing the exclusivity of worshipping the one true God and the dangers of idolatry. Great job!"
