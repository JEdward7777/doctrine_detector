## Question [Biblical Examples of Worship](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md)
Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship is found in the book of Exodus. In Exodus 32, we see the Israelites turning away from worshiping the true God and instead constructing a golden calf to worship. This act of idol worship is contrasted with the true worship of God, as represented by Moses and the faithful remnant who continue to worship the Lord. God's response to the idolatry of the Israelites demonstrates the seriousness of turning away from true worship and placing idols above Him.

This analysis aligns well with a Christian worldview emphasizing the exclusivity of worshipping the one true God and the dangers of idolatry. Great job!
