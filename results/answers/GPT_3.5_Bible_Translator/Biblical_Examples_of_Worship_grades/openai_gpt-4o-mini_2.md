Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship is found in the book of Exodus. In Exodus 32, we see the Israelites turning away from worshiping the true God and instead constructing a golden calf to worship. This act of idol worship is contrasted with the true worship of God, as represented by Moses and the faithful remnant who continue to worship the Lord. God's response to the idolatry of the Israelites demonstrates the seriousness of turning away from true worship and placing idols above Him.
