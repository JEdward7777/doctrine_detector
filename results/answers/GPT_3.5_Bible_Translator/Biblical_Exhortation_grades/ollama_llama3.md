## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Jesus gave his apostles a clear directive regarding the good news. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus told his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he had commanded them (Matthew 28:19-20). This directive is known as the Great Commission and is a foundational command for all Christians to share the good news of Jesus Christ with others and to make disciples.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately conveys Jesus' directive to his apostles in Matthew 28:19-20, which is the Great Commission. It also highlights the importance of evangelism and making disciples, aligning with the concern provided. However, it could be improved by incorporating more specific language about trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin, as mentioned in the given answer.

The response does not explicitly mention the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice for sin, which is a crucial aspect of Christian evangelism. Additionally, while the response touches on the importance of evangelism, it could be more explicit in emphasizing its significance in the Christian faith. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the Great Commission and its relevance to Christian discipleship.

Comment: This response demonstrates a strong foundation in biblical theology and Christian doctrine, but could benefit from further elaboration on the role of Jesus' sacrifice in evangelism.
