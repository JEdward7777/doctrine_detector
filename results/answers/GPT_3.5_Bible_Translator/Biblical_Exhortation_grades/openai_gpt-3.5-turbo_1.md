Jesus gave his apostles a clear directive regarding the good news. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus told his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he had commanded them (Matthew 28:19-20). This directive is known as the Great Commission and is a foundational command for all Christians to share the good news of Jesus Christ with others and to make disciples.
