  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid and well-rounded explanation of how the references to Jesus as \"King of the Jews\" in the Bible reflect Old Testament prophecies. The student effectively references key Old Testament passages such as Micah 5:2, Isaiah 9:6-7, and Psalms to support their argument. The explanation is clear and connects the Old Testament prophecies to Jesus as the fulfillment of those prophecies. However, the response could have been strengthened by delving deeper into the specific connections between Jesus' role as \"King of the Jews\" and the Old Testament prophecies, perhaps by exploring more parallels and nuances in the text. Overall, a strong effort with room for further depth and detail."
