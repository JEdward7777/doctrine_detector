  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer that extensively connects the title \"King of the Jews\" to various Old Testament prophecies. They effectively highlighted key verses from Micah, Isaiah, and Psalms that foretell the coming of a ruler who would reign with justice and righteousness. However, the student's response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern of how the title \"King of the Jews\" specifically reflects Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah from David's line establishing an everlasting kingdom, as mentioned in the reference answer."
