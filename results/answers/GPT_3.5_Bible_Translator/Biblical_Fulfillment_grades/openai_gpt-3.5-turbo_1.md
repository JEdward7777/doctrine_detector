# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "King of the Jews" given to Jesus in the New Testament reflects Old Testament prophecies in several ways. One of the key prophecies that is often associated with this title is found in the book of Micah.

In Micah 5:2, it is prophesied that a ruler will come from Bethlehem, who will be a shepherd to his people Israel. This ruler is described as one whose origins are from ancient times. This prophecy is often understood by Christians as a foreshadowing of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, who is seen as the true King of the Jews.

Additionally, in the book of Isaiah, there are numerous prophecies that speak of a coming King who will reign with justice and righteousness. For example, in Isaiah 9:6-7, it is prophesied that a child will be born who will be called "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." This child is described as ruling on David's throne and establishing his kingdom with justice and righteousness forever.

Furthermore, in the Psalms, there are references to the Messiah being a King who will reign over all nations. Psalm 72, for example, describes the king as ruling with justice and righteousness, bringing peace and prosperity to the people.

In the New Testament, the title "King of the Jews" is used in connection with Jesus' crucifixion. It is significant because it proclaims Jesus' true identity as the long-awaited Messiah, the King who fulfills the Old Testament prophecies. Despite the mockery and disbelief of those who crucified him, Jesus truly is the King of the Jews and the Savior of all who believe in him.

In conclusion, the references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the Bible reflect Old Testament prophecies by affirming Jesus' identity as the promised Messiah who fulfills the prophecies of a coming King who will reign with justice, righteousness, and peace.
