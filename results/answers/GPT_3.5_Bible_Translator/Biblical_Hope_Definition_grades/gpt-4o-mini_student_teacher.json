  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of hope in a biblical context, emphasizing the importance of faith and trust in God's promises. However, the student's response differed slightly from the reference answer in terms of defining hope as a \"confident expectation\" versus a \"strong desire.\" While both aspects are present in the student's answer, the emphasis on assurance could have been balanced with a clearer emphasis on desire and trust for a more aligned Christian worldview perspective."
