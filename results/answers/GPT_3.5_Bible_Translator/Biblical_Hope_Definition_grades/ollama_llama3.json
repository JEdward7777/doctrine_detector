  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 90.\n\nThe response demonstrates a strong understanding of the spiritual foundation of hope in the Christian faith, accurately highlighting its connection to God's promises and character. The explanation that hope is \"not just wishful thinking or optimism, but a firm assurance\" is particularly insightful, as it emphasizes the confidence and trust that underlies biblical hope.\n\nWhile the response could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting hope to the Trinity (as hinted at in the phrase \"closely connected to faith and love\"), its overall clarity and theological accuracy earn it a high grade."
