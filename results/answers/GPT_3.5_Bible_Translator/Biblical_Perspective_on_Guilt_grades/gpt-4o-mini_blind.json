  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of how the Bible illustrates the consequences of guilt and sin, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively explains biblical examples of the consequences of sin and the remedy for it through Jesus Christ. The emphasis on repentance, confession, and turning away from sin aligns well with Christian doctrine. Overall, it is a well-rounded and doctrinally sound response. Great job!"
