The mention of Jesus Christ as the solution for sin and the emphasis on repentance and faith are commendable. However, there could be a little more elaboration on the specific consequences of sin and how they affect individuals and communities in order to fully appreciate God's grace and mercy. Overall, a solid response with a good application of a Christian worldview."
