  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses that effectively convey the concept of God's majesty, specifically through His glory, holiness, and splendor in creation. While the provided verses are excellent examples, the teacher's reference answer includes additional verses that could further deepen the understanding of God's majestic nature. Encouraging the student to explore and incorporate a wider range of scripture references would enhance their answer."
