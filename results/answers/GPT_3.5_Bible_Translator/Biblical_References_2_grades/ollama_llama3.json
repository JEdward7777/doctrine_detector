  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the provided response does not match the specified answer, it does attempt to connect scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature. The example verses from Psalms, Isaiah, and Job do indeed illustrate God's majesty in creation, glory above all heavens, and holiness that fills the earth. However, the connection is limited to a brief summary of these verses without explicitly discussing how they demonstrate God's majestic nature.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into the biblical text, explaining how specific verses reveal God's majesty through their language, imagery, or theological themes. Additionally, providing more connections between the scriptural examples and a broader understanding of God's majestic nature would strengthen the argument."
