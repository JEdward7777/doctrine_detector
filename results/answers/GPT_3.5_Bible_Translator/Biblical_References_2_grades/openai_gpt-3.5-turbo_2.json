  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively connects scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature by providing specific Bible verses that highlight God's majesty in creation, His glory above all heavens, and His holiness that fills the earth. The inclusion of Psalm 8:1, Psalm 104:1-2, Isaiah 6:3, and Job 37:22 showcases a comprehensive understanding of God's majesty as portrayed in the Bible. While the additional verses could have enhanced the response further, the provided verses align well with the concern and effectively demonstrate God's majestic nature."
