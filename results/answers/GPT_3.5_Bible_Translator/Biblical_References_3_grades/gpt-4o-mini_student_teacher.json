  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-developed explanation of the Old Testament reference to the Son of Man in Daniel 7 and its connection to Jesus' self-identification in the New Testament. They accurately identify the significance of this passage in Daniel as a Messianic prophecy pointing to a divine figure who will have ultimate authority and power. Additionally, they effectively demonstrate the continuity and fulfillment of Messianic prophecy in Jesus Christ. However, the student could have further enriched their response by also referencing Ezekiel as pointed out in the teacher's reference answer. This additional biblical reference would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the title 'Son of Man' in the Old Testament context."
