  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\". The writer provides a clear and concise explanation of the reference to the Son of Man in Daniel 7:13-14, highlighting its connection to Messianic prophecy. Additionally, they skillfully connect this passage to Jesus' self-identifications in the New Testament, demonstrating a continuity between Old and New Testaments.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not fully engage with the specified answer. While it mentions Daniel 7:14, it does not adequately explore Ezekiel's usage of \"son of man\" as prophetic identity, which is an important aspect of understanding the title in both Old and New Testaments.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical context and its relevance to Jesus' messianic role, but could be improved by more thoroughly engaging with the specified answer."
