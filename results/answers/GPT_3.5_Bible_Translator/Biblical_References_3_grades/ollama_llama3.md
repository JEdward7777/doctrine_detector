## Question [Biblical References 3](../../../questions/Biblical_References_3.md)
Which Old Testament references contribute to the understanding of the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah?

## Correct Answer
Key references include Daniel 7:14, where the 'Son of Man' is depicted coming with the clouds, and Ezekiel, where God addresses Ezekiel as 'son of man,' illustrating the connection between the title and prophetic identity.

## Stated Concern
To explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesusâ€™ messianic role as the 'Son of Man.'

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Son of Man" is used in the Old Testament in the Book of Daniel, specifically in Daniel 7:13-14. This passage describes a vision in which Daniel sees "one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven" who is given authority, glory, and sovereign power over all nations. This figure is presented as receiving worship and an everlasting kingdom that will never be destroyed.

This passage in Daniel is often seen as a Messianic prophecy, pointing to the coming of a divine figure who will be given ultimate authority and power by God. In the New Testament, Jesus frequently refers to himself as the Son of Man, connecting himself to this prophetic figure in Daniel. Through this identification, Jesus reaffirms his divinity and his role as the promised Messiah who will rule over all.

By understanding the Old Testament reference to the Son of Man in Daniel 7 in connection with Jesus' self-identifications in the New Testament, we see a continuity and fulfillment of Messianic prophecy in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 85.

The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man". The writer provides a clear and concise explanation of the reference to the Son of Man in Daniel 7:13-14, highlighting its connection to Messianic prophecy. Additionally, they skillfully connect this passage to Jesus' self-identifications in the New Testament, demonstrating a continuity between Old and New Testaments.

However, I would deduct points because the response does not fully engage with the specified answer. While it mentions Daniel 7:14, it does not adequately explore Ezekiel's usage of "son of man" as prophetic identity, which is an important aspect of understanding the title in both Old and New Testaments.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical context and its relevance to Jesus' messianic role, but could be improved by more thoroughly engaging with the specified answer.
