The student effectively connects the prophetic identity described in the Old Testament with Jesus' self-identification in the New Testament, demonstrating a clear continuity and fulfillment of Messianic prophecy. The response shows a strong grasp of the topic and effectively explores the biblical connection between the Old and New Testaments."
