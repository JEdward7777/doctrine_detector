## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Son of Man" is used in the Old Testament in the Book of Daniel, specifically in Daniel 7:13-14. This passage describes a vision in which Daniel sees "one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven" who is given authority, glory, and sovereign power over all nations. This figure is presented as receiving worship and an everlasting kingdom that will never be destroyed.

This passage in Daniel is often seen as a Messianic prophecy, pointing to the coming of a divine figure who will be given ultimate authority and power by God. In the New Testament, Jesus frequently refers to himself as the Son of Man, connecting himself to this prophetic figure in Daniel. Through this identification, Jesus reaffirms his divinity and his role as the promised Messiah who will rule over all.

By understanding the Old Testament reference to the Son of Man in Daniel 7 in connection with Jesus' self-identifications in the New Testament, we see a continuity and fulfillment of Messianic prophecy in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
