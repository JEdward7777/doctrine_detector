It effectively connects these Old Testament references to Jesus' self-identifications in the New Testament, demonstrating how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' The response could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how Jesus' actions and teachings align with the prophetic role of the 'Son of Man' in the Old Testament."
