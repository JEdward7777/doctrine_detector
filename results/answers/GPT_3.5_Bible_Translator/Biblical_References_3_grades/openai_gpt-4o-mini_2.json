It effectively demonstrates how the Old Testament prophecy informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' The explanation is clear, well-supported with biblical references, and aligns with a Christian worldview perspective. The only minor improvement could be providing more specific examples or elaboration on how Jesus' self-identifications fulfil the Messianic prophecy in Daniel."
