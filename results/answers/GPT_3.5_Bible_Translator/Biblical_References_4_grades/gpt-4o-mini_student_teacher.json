  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided appropriate biblical passages illustrating the use of 'Lord' in the context of God and highlighted the reverence and worship towards God as Lord. However, the student's response could have been improved by including a wider range of biblical references as suggested in the teacher's answer. Also, a deeper explanation connecting the passages to the concept of God's authority and divinity would have enhanced the answer."
