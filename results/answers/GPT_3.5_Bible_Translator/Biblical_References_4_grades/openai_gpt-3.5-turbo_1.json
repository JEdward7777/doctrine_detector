  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides appropriate examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in reference to God, demonstrating reverence and worship. The selected passages effectively reinforce the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord, in line with the Christian worldview. However, the response could be improved by including more diverse examples from different sections of the Bible to provide a broader understanding of the concept of 'Lord' in the context of God."
