Sure, here are some examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God:

1. Psalm 8:1 - "O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens."

2. Exodus 20:2-3 - "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me."

3. Isaiah 45:5-6 - "I am the Lord, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged me, so that from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting people may know there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is no other."

4. Matthew 22:37-38 - Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment."

These passages demonstrate the reverence and worship ascribed to God as Lord in the Bible.
