## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
One New Testament scripture that connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings is found in 1 Corinthians 5:7-8. It states:

"Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batchâ€”as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."

This passage draws a parallel between the tradition of removing leaven from bread during the Jewish festival of Passover and the Christian call to remove sin from our lives through the sacrificial death of Christ. Just as the Israelites were instructed to eat unleavened bread as a sign of their deliverance from slavery in Egypt, Christians are called to live lives free from sin through faith in Christ.
