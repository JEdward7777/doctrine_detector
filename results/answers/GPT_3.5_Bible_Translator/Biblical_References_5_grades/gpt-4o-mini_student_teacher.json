  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 90. \n\nThe student correctly identified 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 as a New Testament scripture that connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings. The student provided a detailed explanation of the passage, drawing parallels between the removal of leaven during Passover and the Christian call to remove sin through Christ's sacrifice. \n\nThe student's response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer and effectively demonstrates an understanding of how this biblical text provides insight into Christian practices. The only minor improvement would be to reference the specific verses mentioned in the teacher's answer (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) rather than just stating 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 in order to correspond more precisely with the teacher's response."
