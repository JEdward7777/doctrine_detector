The verses quoted are doctrinally sound and effectively demonstrate the Christian belief in the resurrection of the dead. The answer could have been further enhanced by providing a brief explanation or theological reflection on the significance of these verses within Christian theology. Overall, a strong and scripturally grounded response."
