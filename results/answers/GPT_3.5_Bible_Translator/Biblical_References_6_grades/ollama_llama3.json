  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe main strength of this response is that it provides a good selection of Bible verses that relate to the concept of resurrection, which aligns well with the concern of focusing on scripture as the foundation for Christian beliefs and teachings. The verses provided are all relevant and accurate, and they demonstrate a clear understanding of the biblical teaching on resurrection.\n\nHowever, I would deduct some points because the response could be improved by explicitly connecting the Bible verses to the concept of resurrection and eternal life. While the verses themselves are sufficient to convey this information, the reader may need to infer the connection between them and the topic of resurrection. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more explicit discussion of how these verses support or illustrate Christian beliefs about resurrection.\n\nOverall, while there is room for improvement, this response demonstrates a good understanding of biblical teaching on resurrection and does an excellent job of focusing on scripture as authoritative Christian texts."
