The inclusion of verses like 1 Corinthians 15:20-22, John 11:25-26, 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, and Philippians 3:20-21 strengthens the explanation of the Christian belief in resurrection. This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of scriptural references in grounding beliefs and teachings in Christian doctrine."
