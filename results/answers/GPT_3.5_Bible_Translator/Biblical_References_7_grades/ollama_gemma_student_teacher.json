  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical significance of the Sabbath. They effectively cited relevant passages from Exodus, Mark, and Hebrews to support their claims. The response also clearly articulates the purpose of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship, acknowledging God as the Creator and Lord of the Sabbath. While the student's answer is well-written and informative, it could benefit from including additional supporting details from other biblical sources."
