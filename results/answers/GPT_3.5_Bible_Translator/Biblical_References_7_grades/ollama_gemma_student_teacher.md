## [Answer](../Biblical_References_7.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Sure! Here are a few Bible references that highlight the significance of the Sabbath:

1. Exodus 20:8-11 - "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."

2. Mark 2:27-28 - "Then he said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.'"

3. Hebrews 4:9-10 - "There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters Godâ€™s rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his."

These verses emphasize the importance of observing the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship, as well as acknowledging God's role as the Creator and Lord of the Sabbath.
