The references cited effectively demonstrate the command to observe the Sabbath, its purpose as a day of rest and worship, and God's authority over it as the Creator. The inclusion of the specific verses enhances the depth and clarity of the response. Overall, this answer aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern raised. Great job!"
