The student effectively connects these verses to the understanding of redemption by highlighting the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death and the universal scope of His redemptive work. The explanation could be enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications of ransom and the connection to Old Testament sacrifices as foreshadowing Christ's ultimate sacrifice. Overall, a good understanding is demonstrated in linking ransom to redemption."
