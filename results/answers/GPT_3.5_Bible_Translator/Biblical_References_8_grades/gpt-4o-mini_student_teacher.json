  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of ransom in the Bible, citing relevant verses such as Mark 10:45 and 1 Timothy 2:5-6. They effectively highlighted the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death and the universal scope of His redemptive work. However, the student could have improved their grade by including additional key verses like Isaiah 43:3 and Matthew 20:28 to provide a more comprehensive biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic but could have expanded their analysis with more scriptural references."
