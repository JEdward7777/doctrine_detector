## [Answer](../Biblical_References_8.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
One of the key Bible verses that references the concept of ransom is found in Mark 10:45, where Jesus states, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." This verse highlights the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death on the cross, emphasizing that His life was given as a payment to redeem and free many from sin and death.

Another important verse that speaks to the concept of ransom is 1 Timothy 2:5-6, which says, "For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people." This passage underscores the universal scope of Jesus' redemptive work, highlighting that His ransom is available to all who put their faith in Him.

The concept of ransom in the Bible contributes to our understanding of redemption by emphasizing the costly price that was paid for our salvation. The idea of a ransom implies that a debt needed to be paid in order to secure our freedom from sin and death, and Jesus willingly offered Himself as the payment for that debt. This serves as a powerful reminder of God's love and grace towards us, as well as the magnitude of the sacrifice that was made on our behalf. Ultimately, the concept of ransom points to the incredible act of redemption that was accomplished through Christ's death and resurrection, providing hope and eternal life for all who believe.
