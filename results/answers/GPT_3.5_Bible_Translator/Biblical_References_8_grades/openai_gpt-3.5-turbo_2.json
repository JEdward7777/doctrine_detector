The analysis effectively highlights the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death and the universal scope of His redemptive work. The biblical foundation for the theology of redemption is well-explored and supported with relevant scripture references. Overall, this response effectively integrates a Christian worldview in discussing the concept of ransom in the Bible. Great job!"
