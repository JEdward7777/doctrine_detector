The explanation of how the concept of ransom contributes to our understanding of redemption is clear and well-supported. The integration of relevant Bible verses and their interpretation effectively demonstrates the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death and the universal scope of His redemptive work."
