The concept of covenant faithfulness is central throughout the Bible, especially in the Old Testament. Here are some key verses that highlight this theme:

1. Deuteronomy 7:9 - "Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations."
   
2. Psalm 89:34 - "I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips."
   
3. Isaiah 54:10 - "For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed," says the Lord, who has compassion on you."
   
4. Malachi 2:5 - "My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him. It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name."
   
5. Hebrews 10:23 - "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful."

These verses demonstrate how God is faithful in keeping His promises and upholding the covenants He has made with His people. They encourage believers to trust in God's faithfulness and to remain faithful in return.

**Grade: 85/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of covenant faithfulness and provides relevant biblical references to support their claim. They clearly articulate how God's faithfulness is central to His character and how He upholds His promises. However, including the suggested reference verses from Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18 would have strengthened the response and aligned it more closely with the specified concern.
