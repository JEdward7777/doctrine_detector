However, it could be enhanced by directly addressing the concern and connecting the given examples of Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18 to the understanding of covenant faithfulness. Expanding on how these specific verses illustrate God's faithfulness in keeping His covenants would strengthen the response."
