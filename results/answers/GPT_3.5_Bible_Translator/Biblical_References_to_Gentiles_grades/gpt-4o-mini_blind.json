  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 in relation to the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. They correctly pointed out the significance of faith in Jesus Christ for both Jews and Gentiles, highlighting the central role of Jesus in salvation for all believers. The explanation could have been enhanced by delving deeper into the theological nuances and implications of Gentile inclusion, but overall, the response was doctrinally sound."
