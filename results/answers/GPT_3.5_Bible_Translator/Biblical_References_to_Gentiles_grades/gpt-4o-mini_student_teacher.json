  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the passages in Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 regarding the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. They correctly point out the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for justification and salvation, as opposed to adherence to the law or ethnicity. The only area for improvement is that the student could have more directly addressed the concern of exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion, as stated in the question prompt."
