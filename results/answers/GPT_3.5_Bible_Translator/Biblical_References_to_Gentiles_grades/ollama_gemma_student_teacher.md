## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Gentiles.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 both reveal that Gentiles are included in the Christian faith through faith in Jesus Christ. In Acts 9:13-16, we see the conversion of Saul (later known as the apostle Paul) who was called by God to be a messenger to the Gentiles. This event highlights God's plan to include Gentiles in the spread of the Christian faith.

Galatians 2:16 emphasizes that justification and salvation come through faith in Jesus Christ, not through observing the law or through one's ethnicity. This is significant for the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith because it shows that both Jews and Gentiles are justified and saved by faith in Jesus Christ alone.

Overall, these passages reveal that Gentiles are included in the Christian faith through faith in Jesus Christ, as salvation is offered to all who believe in Him regardless of their background or ethnicity.
