The integration of Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 provides a solid biblical foundation for affirming faith in Jesus Christ as the unifying factor for both Jews and Gentiles in salvation. The connection between the apostolic mission to Gentiles and the importance of faith over the law is well articulated. The response could further enhance its analysis by exploring additional verses or theological implications for a more comprehensive understanding."
