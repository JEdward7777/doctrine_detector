  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively analyzes Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 in the context of the apostolic mission to Gentiles and the importance of faith in Jesus for justification. It accurately captures the key teachings on grace and inclusion as emphasized in the provided Bible passages. The reference to salvation being offered to all through belief in Jesus Christ alone is well-founded in Christian theology."
