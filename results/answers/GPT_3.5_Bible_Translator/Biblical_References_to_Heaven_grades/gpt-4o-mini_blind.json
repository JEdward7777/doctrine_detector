They accurately referenced verses that discuss treasures in heaven, rooms in the Father's house, the incomprehensible nature of what God has prepared, and the future state of no more tears, death, mourning, or pain. The response effectively conveys the beauty, peace, and joy that believers can anticipate in eternity. Great job!"
