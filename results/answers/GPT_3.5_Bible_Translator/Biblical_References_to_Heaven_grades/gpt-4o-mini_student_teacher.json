  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student identified relevant Bible verses that discuss the concept of heaven and provided explanations for their significance, the teacher's reference answer includes additional key verses that offer a more holistic view of the concept of heaven. Therefore, the student's answer could have been improved by including a wider range of verses to provide a more comprehensive understanding of heaven from a Christian perspective."
