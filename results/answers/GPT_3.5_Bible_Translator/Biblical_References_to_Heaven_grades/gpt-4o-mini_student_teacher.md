## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Heaven.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
There are several Bible verses that provide insight into the concept of heaven:

1. Matthew 6:20-21 - "But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

2. John 14:2-3 - "My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am."

3. 1 Corinthians 2:9 - "However, as it is written: 'What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived'— the things God has prepared for those who love him."

4. Revelation 21:4 - "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."

These verses give us a glimpse of the beauty, peace, and joy that await believers in heaven, where we will be in the presence of God for all eternity.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's answer a 70.

While the student identified relevant Bible verses that discuss the concept of heaven and provided explanations for their significance, the teacher's reference answer includes additional key verses that offer a more holistic view of the concept of heaven. Therefore, the student's answer could have been improved by including a wider range of verses to provide a more comprehensive understanding of heaven from a Christian perspective.
