  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) from a Christian perspective, mentioning its significance as portrayed in Acts chapter 2 where the Holy Spirit was poured out on the disciples. The connection to the birth of the Christian church and the spread of the Gospel message is clearly articulated. The answer could be further improved by mentioning the Old Testament references to the Festival of Weeks in Leviticus 23:15-22 and Deuteronomy 16:9-12."
