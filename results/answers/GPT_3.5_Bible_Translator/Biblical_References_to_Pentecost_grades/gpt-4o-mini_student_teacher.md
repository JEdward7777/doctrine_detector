## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Festival of Weeks is also known as Pentecost, which is celebrated 50 days after Passover. In the Bible, the significance of Pentecost is found primarily in the book of Acts, chapter 2. This is where we see the Holy Spirit being poured out on the disciples, empowering them to speak in other languages and boldly preach the Gospel to all nations. The event of Pentecost marks the birth of the Christian church and the beginning of the spread of the Gospel message to the ends of the earth.

Comment: The student provided a solid answer that correctly identifies Pentecost as the Festival of Weeks, mentions its timing after Passover, and highlights its significance in the book of Acts with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the disciples. However, there is room for improvement in referencing specific books in the Bible that contain mentions of the Festival of Weeks, which would enhance the depth of the response from a scriptural basis perspective.
