  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer correctly identifies the connection between the Festival of Weeks and Pentecost, correctly locating the primary reference in Acts, chapter 2. However, the response would benefit from additional textual references to support the claims made. Including specific verses from the listed books (2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, Numbers) would enhance the completeness and accuracy of the response."
