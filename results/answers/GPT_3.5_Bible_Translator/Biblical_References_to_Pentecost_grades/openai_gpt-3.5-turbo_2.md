The Festival of Weeks is also known as Pentecost, which is celebrated 50 days after Passover. In the Bible, the significance of Pentecost is found primarily in the book of Acts, chapter 2. This is where we see the Holy Spirit being poured out on the disciples, empowering them to speak in other languages and boldly preach the Gospel to all nations. The event of Pentecost marks the birth of the Christian church and the beginning of the spread of the Gospel message to the ends of the earth.
