  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the Festival of Weeks/Pentecost, referencing the relevant scriptures, including Acts 2. It effectively highlights the significance of Pentecost as the empowering of the disciples by the Holy Spirit to spread the Gospel. The response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the key role of the Old Testament passages in establishing the foundation for the significance of Pentecost in Christian theology."
