  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the scriptural foundations for the belief in Jesus as Savior by referencing specific verses (1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20) and highlighting the inclusive nature of Christ's saving work, the importance of faith in Him, and the consequences of turning away from Him. The explanation is clear and directly addresses the concern raised, but could have been strengthened by providing a broader range of supporting verses to further solidify the scriptural basis for the belief in Jesus as Savior."
