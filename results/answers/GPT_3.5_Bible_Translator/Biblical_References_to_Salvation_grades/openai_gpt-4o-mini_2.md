In 1 Timothy 4:10, it states, "For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe."

In 2 Peter 2:20, it warns, "For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first." This passage emphasizes the necessity of continuing in faith and not turning away from the salvation offered by Christ. It shows that Christ is the only means of redemption, and those who reject Him or turn away from Him will face grave consequences.

Overall, these passages reveal that Christ is the Savior who offers salvation to all people, but it is essential for individuals to believe in Him and continue in faith to experience the fullness of His saving work.
