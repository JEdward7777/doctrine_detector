  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: This student provided a solid response by correctly identifying key verses that reference Jesus as the cornerstone and explaining their significance in relation to His role in the foundation of faith and the Church. The student effectively conveyed the importance of Jesus as the foundational stone of the Christian faith and how belief in Him is crucial for salvation and unity. However, the student missed referencing Matthew 21:42 and Psalms 118:22, which were provided in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to pay closer attention to all the verses mentioned in the question would strengthen their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith. Overall, a good effort with room for improvement in thoroughness."
