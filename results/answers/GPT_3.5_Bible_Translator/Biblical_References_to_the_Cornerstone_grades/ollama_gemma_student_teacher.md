There are a few Bible verses that reference Jesus as the cornerstone:

1. Ephesians 2:20 - "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."
This verse highlights the significance of Jesus as the foundational stone upon which the Church is built. Just as a cornerstone is crucial for the stability and integrity of a building, Jesus is essential for the unity and strength of the Church.

2. 1 Peter 2:6 - "For it stands in Scripture: 'Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.'"
This verse refers to Jesus as the chosen and precious cornerstone, emphasizing His importance in the plan of God for salvation. Belief in Jesus is the key to being secure and not being ashamed.

3. Acts 4:11 - "This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone."
Here, Jesus is portrayed as the rejected stone that becomes the cornerstone. Despite being rejected by people, Jesus is ultimately exalted and essential for salvation.

These verses collectively convey that Jesus is the foundational stone of the Christian faith, essential for salvation, unity, and the Church's strength. Just as a cornerstone supports and unites the building, Jesus supports, unites, and secures believers in their faith.
