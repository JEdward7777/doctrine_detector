## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Most_High.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
There are several verses in the Bible that refer to God as the "Most High" and reveal aspects of His character. One of the most well-known verses is Psalm 47:2 which says, "For the Lord Most High is awesome, the great King over all the earth." This verse emphasizes God's supremacy and sovereignty over all creation.

Another verse is Psalm 91:1-2 which says, "He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.'" This passage highlights God's protection and care for those who trust in Him, showing His loving and sheltering nature.

Psalm 83:18 also refers to God as the Most High, saying, "Let them know that you, whose name is the Lordâ€” that you alone are the Most High over all the earth." This verse affirms God's supreme authority and power over all creation.

These verses and others that refer to God as the Most High reveal His character as sovereign, powerful, protective, and worthy of trust and worship. They remind us that God is above all else, and that we can find refuge and strength in Him.

However, the student could have further explored the significance of God's eternal nature and authority over nations and rulers as revealed in verses like Psalm 83:18 and Daniel 4:17 to fully appreciate the depth of God's sovereignty portrayed in the Bible.
