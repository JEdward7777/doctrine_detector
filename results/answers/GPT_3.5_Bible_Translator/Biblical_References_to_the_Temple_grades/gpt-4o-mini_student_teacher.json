  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant scriptures that reference the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" in their answer, but missed key verses like 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4. They demonstrated a good understanding of the concept but could have included more comprehensive and specific references as highlighted in the teacher's answer."
