2. 1 Kings 8:10-13 - "When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the Lord. And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled his temple."
3. Psalm 27:4 - "One thing I ask from the Lord, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple."

Comment: The student provided some relevant scriptures that reference the temple as the "house of Yahweh" in their answer, but missed key verses like 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4. They demonstrated a good understanding of the concept but could have included more comprehensive and specific references as highlighted in the teacher's answer.
