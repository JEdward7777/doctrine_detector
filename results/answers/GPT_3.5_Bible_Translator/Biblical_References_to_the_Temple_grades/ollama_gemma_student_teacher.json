  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is thorough and provides accurate references to scriptures that specifically mention the temple as the \"house of Yahweh.\" However, the reference answer provided by the teacher includes additional scriptures not mentioned by the student. Including these additional scriptures would have earned the student a slightly higher grade."
