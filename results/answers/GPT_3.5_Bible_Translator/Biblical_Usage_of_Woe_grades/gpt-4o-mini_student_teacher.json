  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how the term \"woe\" is used in the Bible to convey God's judgment, backing it up with relevant examples from Isaiah, Matthew, and Revelation. However, the student could have included more direct references to the passages specified in the teacher's answer (Ezekiel 13:17-18, Habakkuk 2:12, and Matthew 23:23) to align more closely with the provided reference answer. Overall, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed in scripture."
