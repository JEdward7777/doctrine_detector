  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the term \"woe\" in the Bible, connecting it to various passages that highlight the seriousness of divine judgment. The examples chosen effectively demonstrate how \"woe\" is used to emphasize severe judgment upon those who sin or lead others astray. The explanation given aligns well with the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture from a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more direct quotations from the cited passages to further strengthen the analysis."
