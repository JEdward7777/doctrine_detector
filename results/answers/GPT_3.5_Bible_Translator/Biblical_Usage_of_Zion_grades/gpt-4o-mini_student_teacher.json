  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student demonstrated a good understanding of the various ways in which the term \"Zion\" is used in the Bible, both literally and figuratively. They correctly identified Zion as a symbol of God's presence, blessing, and salvation among his people. The student also highlighted the metaphorical use of Zion in the New Testament to represent the heavenly Jerusalem that believers anticipate as their eternal dwelling place.\n\nHowever, the student's answer did not explicitly mention Israel as part of the figurative usage of \"Zion,\" which was mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Including this aspect would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the term in Christian theology. Thus, a slight deduction from a perfect score is warranted."
