## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In biblical times, altars were commonly constructed using various materials such as uncut stones, wood, bronze, or gold. The specific material used for an altar depended on the resources available to the people and the purpose of the altar. For example, in the Old Testament, we see altars made of uncut stones (Exodus 20:24-25), wood (1 Kings 18:31-32), bronze (Exodus 27:1-2), and gold (Exodus 40:26-29). The key emphasis in constructing altars in the Bible was on the sincerity and reverence of the worship offered rather than on the material used.
