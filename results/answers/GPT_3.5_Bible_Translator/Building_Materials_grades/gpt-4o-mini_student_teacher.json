  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive answer that listed various materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times and referenced biblical verses to support their points. They also emphasized the importance of sincerity and reverence in worship, which aligns with Christian teachings on the significance of worship. However, the answer included some additional materials not commonly used for altars, like gold. The reference answer specifies packed dirt or large stones as common materials, which the student did not explicitly mention. Despite this small deviation, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and connected it well to biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship."
