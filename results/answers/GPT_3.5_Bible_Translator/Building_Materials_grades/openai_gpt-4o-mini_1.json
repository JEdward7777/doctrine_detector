  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the materials commonly used for constructing altars in biblical times, accurately mentioning materials like uncut stones, wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze. The inclusion of relevant biblical references adds depth to the explanation. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of altars in Christian worship and the importance of sincerity and reverence rather than solely focusing on the materials used."
