  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response does a good job of highlighting the importance of personal responsibility in sanctification by referencing specific biblical commands (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4) that emphasize self-control and moral purity. While it may not explicitly state \"personal responsibility\" as the concern, it effectively conveys the idea that believers are accountable for their own actions and decisions in light of God's standards.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have further developed this point by elaborating on what personal responsibility looks like in practical terms (e.g., how individuals can cultivate habits of self-reflection, confession, and repentance) or providing additional scriptural support for the importance of personal agency in sanctification. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical imperative to live a life of holiness and provides a solid foundation for further discussion on this topic."
