It effectively highlights how the centurion's faith in Jesus' authority to heal demonstrates the importance of faith in divine power. The explanation is clear, coherent, and demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview regarding faith and authority in relation to Jesus' ministry. Great job!"
