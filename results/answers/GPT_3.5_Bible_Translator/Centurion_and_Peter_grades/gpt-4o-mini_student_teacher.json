  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of how the centurion's visit from Peter represents the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community, emphasizing the inclusivity of God's salvation plan. The answer effectively connects the event to the broader mission of the Church to reach all nations. However, the student could have linked the response more directly to the understanding of the inclusivity of the Gospel, as outlined in the concern. Overall, a strong response demonstrating knowledge of the topic from a Christian worldview."
