In the Bible, the chief priests held higher positions of authority and leadership among the priests. The chief priests were typically part of the ruling council known as the Sanhedrin, which was composed of elders and chief priests. They were responsible for overseeing the religious affairs of the Jewish people and played a significant role in the governance of the Jewish community during that time.

While ordinary priests served in various roles within the temple and were involved in offering sacrifices and leading worship, the chief priests had greater authority and often made important decisions related to religious matters and Jewish law. The chief priests were seen as the spiritual and religious elite among the priests, and their opinions and judgments were highly respected.

Overall, the chief priests held a position of higher authority and leadership compared to ordinary priests in the religious hierarchy of ancient Israel.
