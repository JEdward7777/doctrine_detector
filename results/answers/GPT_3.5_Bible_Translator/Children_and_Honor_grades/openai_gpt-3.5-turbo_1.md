# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible instructs children to honor their parents in several passages:

1. The Fifth Commandment: In Exodus 20:12, it says, "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you." This is one of the Ten Commandments given by God to the Israelites.

2. Ephesians 6:1-3: In the New Testament, the apostle Paul reiterates this commandment in Ephesians 6:1-3, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—which is the first commandment with a promise— 'so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.'"

3. Colossians 3:20: Similarly, in Colossians 3:20, it says, "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."

These verses emphasize the importance of children showing respect, obedience, and love towards their parents. Honoring parents is not only a cultural expectation but also a commandment from God that carries a promise of blessings for those who obey it.
