As children of God, believers have the privilege of being part of God's family. This means that they are loved unconditionally, accepted, and valued by God. It also implies a close and personal relationship with God, where believers can approach Him with boldness and confidence, knowing that He is their Heavenly Father who loves them deeply.

Overall, being referred to as "children of God" transforms the relationship between believers and God into a loving, familial bond that is characterized by grace, mercy, and a deep sense of belonging.
