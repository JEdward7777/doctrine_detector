Being referred to as "children of God" has a profound impact on the relationship between believers and God. This designation signifies a special and intimate relationship between God and believers. It reflects the love, care, and protection that God provides to those who have faith in Him.

As children of God, believers have the privilege of being part of God's family. This means that they are loved unconditionally, accepted, and valued by God. It also implies a close and personal relationship with God, where believers can approach Him with boldness and confidence, knowing that He is their Heavenly Father who loves them deeply.
