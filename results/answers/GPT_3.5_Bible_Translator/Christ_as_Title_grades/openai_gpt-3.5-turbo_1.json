The response effectively shows how recognizing the title \"Christ\" deepens understanding of Jesus's divine appointment and purpose. This aligns well with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the importance of Jesus as the anointed one fulfilling messianic prophecies and offering salvation to humanity. Great work!"
