## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
One practice that modern Christians might adopt to reflect the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness is to maintain a lifestyle of holiness and purity. This includes avoiding actions and behaviors that are contrary to God's commands and seeking forgiveness and cleansing through confession and repentance when we fall short.

Another practice could be regular spiritual disciplines such as prayer, reading and studying the Bible, worship, and participation in the sacraments of the Church (such as baptism and communion). These practices help us stay connected to God and cultivate a heart of obedience and devotion.

Additionally, Christians can also practice hospitality and serving others in a way that reflects the love and kindness of God. This includes taking care of the poor, the widows, and the orphans, as well as showing compassion and grace to those in need.

Overall, the key is to strive for inner purity and outward holiness in our thoughts, words, and actions, reflecting the righteousness and goodness of God in all aspects of our lives.
