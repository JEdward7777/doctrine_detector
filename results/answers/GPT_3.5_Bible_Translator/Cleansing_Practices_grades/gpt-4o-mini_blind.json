The emphasis on maintaining a lifestyle of holiness, spiritual disciplines, and serving others aligns well with biblical teachings. However, the response could have been strengthened by referencing specific Old Testament laws or principles related to ritual cleanliness to provide a more concrete connection between the two contexts."
