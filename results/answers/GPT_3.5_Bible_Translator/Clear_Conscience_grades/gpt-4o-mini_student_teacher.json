  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of what it means to have a clear conscience in the context of Christian teachings, highlighting the importance of aligning with God's will, seeking forgiveness, and having a close relationship with Him. The answer effectively addresses the concern about spiritual health and alignment with God's will. However, the student could improve by directly aligning the explanation with the reference answer, which states that having a clear conscience means not hiding any sin and being in obedience to God."
