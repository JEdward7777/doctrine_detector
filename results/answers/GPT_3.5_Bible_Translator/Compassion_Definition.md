## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible defines compassion as having a deep awareness of the suffering of others, coupled with a strong desire to alleviate that suffering. Compassion is a key attribute of God, as displayed throughout the Bible in His interactions with His people. 

In the New Testament, Jesus is the ultimate example of compassion. In Matthew 9:36, it says, "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd." Jesus was moved with compassion to heal the sick, feed the hungry, and care for the marginalized and outcast.

As followers of Christ, we are called to imitate His compassion towards others. In Colossians 3:12, we are instructed to "clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience." This means that our actions should be characterized by empathy, kindness, and a willingness to help those in need.

Practical actions associated with being compassionate include helping the poor and needy (Proverbs 19:17, Matthew 25:35-40), forgiving others (Ephesians 4:32), comforting the brokenhearted (2 Corinthians 1:3-4), and showing love to all people (1 Peter 3:8).

Ultimately, being compassionate is about reflecting the love and mercy of God to others, and living out the Gospel in our daily lives.
