The student accurately references relevant biblical passages and demonstrates a clear connection between God's compassion, Jesus' example, and the believer's call to compassion. The integration of the Old and New Testament verses effectively supports the points made. The emphasis on reflecting God's love and mercy through compassionate actions is commendable. Great job!"
