  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that aligns well with the biblical perspective on compassion, referencing relevant scripture verses and highlighting Jesus as the ultimate example of compassion. The student effectively discussed the definition of compassion and associated actions such as helping the poor, forgiving others, and showing love. The answer could have been improved by directly quoting the reference answer provided by the teacher to explicitly connect the answer to the concern."
