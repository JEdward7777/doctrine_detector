  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response provides a clear and accurate definition of compassion, citing biblical examples and emphasizing the importance of both feeling concern for others' suffering and taking action to help them. The writer also correctly identifies Jesus as the ultimate example of compassion and highlights practical actions that demonstrate compassionate living.\n\nThe only area where this response falls short is in its brief treatment of the biblical perspective on compassion. While it mentions various biblical passages, it could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of how these texts shape our understanding of compassion. For instance, the writer could have delved deeper into the biblical concept of \"bearing one another's burdens\" (Galatians 6:2) or explored the connection between compassion and the love commandment found in John 13:34-35.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical perspective on compassion and provides helpful examples for putting it into practice."
