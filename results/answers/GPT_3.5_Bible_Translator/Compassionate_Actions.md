1. The Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) - In this parable, a Samaritan man showed compassion to a wounded man on the side of the road, tending to his wounds and providing for his care.

2. Jesus feeding the 5,000 (Matthew 14:13-21) - In this account, Jesus demonstrates compassion by feeding a large crowd of people who had followed Him to a desolate place, even though He and His disciples had limited resources.

3. The story of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) - In this parable, the father shows compassion to his wayward son who returns home seeking forgiveness, welcoming him back with open arms and celebrating his return.

4. Jesus healing the blind beggar (Mark 10:46-52) - Jesus demonstrates compassion by healing a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, showing mercy and restoring his sight.

These examples highlight the importance of compassion in the Christian faith and serve as a model for believers to show love, kindness, and empathy towards others in need.
