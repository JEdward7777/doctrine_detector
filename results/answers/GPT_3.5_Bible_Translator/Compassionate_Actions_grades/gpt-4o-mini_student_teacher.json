  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided appropriate examples from the Bible where individuals demonstrated compassion, which aligns with the concern of recognizing real-life applications of compassion as modeled by biblical figures. However, the student missed out on mentioning specific biblical figures like Daniel and Hosea as referenced in the teacher's answer. Encouraging the inclusion of a diverse range of examples would enhance the depth and breadth of the response."
