However, the response could have delved deeper into the specific context of the verses, emphasizing more on the Christian worldview that punishment is ultimately about correction and discipline rather than condemnation. Additionally, there could have been a clearer connection to how these teachings shape our perspective on punishment as Christians. Further scriptural support and theological elaboration would have strengthened the answer."
