  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively integrates the teachings from Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 to highlight the importance of mercy, forgiveness, and redemption in shaping our perspective on punishment. The student accurately conveys the message of God's desire for mercy over legalistic condemnation, emphasizing the themes of grace, redemption, and deliverance. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. A deeper analysis of how these teachings reconcile justice with mercy would have enhanced the student's answer further."
