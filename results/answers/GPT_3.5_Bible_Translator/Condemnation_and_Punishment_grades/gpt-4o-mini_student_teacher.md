## [Answer](../Condemnation_and_Punishment.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Matthew 12:7, Jesus is responding to the Pharisees who criticized him for allowing his disciples to pick grain on the Sabbath. He quotes from the book of Hosea, stating, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." This highlights the importance of mercy and compassion over legalistic adherence to rules and regulations. It reminds us that God values forgiveness and grace over condemnation and punishment.

In Psalm 34:22, the psalmist declares, "The Lord redeems his servants; no one will be condemned who takes refuge in him." This verse emphasizes God's role as a redeemer who rescues and protects those who seek refuge in Him. It conveys the message of grace, redemption, and deliverance for those who trust in God.

Taken together, these verses shape our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation by emphasizing God's desire for mercy, forgiveness, and redemption. While punishment may be necessary at times for correction and discipline, the ultimate goal is not condemnation but restoration and reconciliation. God's mercy and grace offer hope and a way for redemption, even in the face of our failures and sins.
