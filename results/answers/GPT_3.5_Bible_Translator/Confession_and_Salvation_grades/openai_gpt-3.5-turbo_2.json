It effectively articulates how confession of Jesus as Lord is intertwined with genuine faith and public acknowledgment of His lordship, leading to salvation. The connection between belief in the heart and confession with the mouth is well-explained and aligns with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of both aspects in the process of salvation."
