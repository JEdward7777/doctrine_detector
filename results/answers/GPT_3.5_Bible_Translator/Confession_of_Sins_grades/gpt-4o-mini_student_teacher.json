  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer on how a Christian can resist temptation according to the Bible. They included relevant scripture references, practical steps, and emphasized the importance of seeking God's help and forgiveness. However, there was a slight deviation from the specific concern of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness, as the focus was more on overcoming temptation in general. Encouraging the student to further highlight the vital connection between acknowledging personal sin, confession, and seeking God's forgiveness would have enhanced their response."
