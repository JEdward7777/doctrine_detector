## [Answer](../Conscience_Understanding.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the conscience is referred to as a moral inner voice that helps a person distinguish between right and wrong. It is often described as a God-given faculty that convicts individuals of sin and urges them to do what is right in the sight of God.

According to Christian beliefs, the conscience functions as a moral compass, guiding believers to make decisions that are in alignment with God's will and teachings. It serves as a tool for discerning right from wrong and for prompting individuals to repent and seek forgiveness when they stray from God's commandments.

The Apostle Paul speaks about the conscience in several of his letters, emphasizing the importance of keeping a clear conscience before God and others (1 Timothy 1:5, 1 Timothy 1:19, 1 Corinthians 8:7). He also warns against ignoring or suppressing one's conscience, as doing so can lead to moral confusion and spiritual harm (1 Timothy 4:2).

Overall, the biblical definition of conscience highlights its role as a moral guide that reflects God's standards of righteousness and prompts believers to live in accordance with His word.
