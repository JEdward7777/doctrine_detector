  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a solid response by listing specific individuals in the Bible who were consecrated to God and explaining their roles and purpose. However, the student's answer could be improved by including a more diverse range of consecrated individuals, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, expanding on the significance of consecration and its importance in biblical history would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
