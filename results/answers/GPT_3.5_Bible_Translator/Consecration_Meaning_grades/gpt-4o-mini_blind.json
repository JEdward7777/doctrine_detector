The student effectively conveys the concept of setting something or someone apart for sacred use or purpose, supported by examples from the Old Testament and the New Testament. The emphasis on consecrating oneself to live a holy and set-apart life in obedience to God is commendable. The answer could have been strengthened by incorporating specific references from the Bible to further support the explanation. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
