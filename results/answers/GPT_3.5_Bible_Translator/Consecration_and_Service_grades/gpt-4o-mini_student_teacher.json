  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a well-explained response on how consecration prepares individuals or things for God's service by aligning them with God's will, empowering them for ministry, and enabling them to bear fruit for God's glory, there was a slight oversight in not emphasizing the aspect of purification and cleansing explicitly. The reference answer specifically stresses the cleansing aspect of consecration, which is fundamental in preparing individuals or things for God's service. Therefore, the student's answer, although comprehensive, could have been improved by highlighting the crucial purification process that comes with consecration."
