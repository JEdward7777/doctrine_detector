# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible has much to say about the dangers of pride and the importance of humility. 

One verse that addresses this is Proverbs 16:18, which states, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." This verse warns us that pride can lead to our downfall and destruction. Additionally, Proverbs 29:23 says, "A man's pride will bring him low, but the humble in spirit will retain honor." 

In the New Testament, James 4:6 reminds us, "But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, 'God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.'" This verse emphasizes that God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.

Jesus himself emphasized the importance of humility in Matthew 18:4 when he said, "Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven." 

Ultimately, the Bible teaches us that humility is essential for our relationship with God, as well as for our relationships with others. It is through humility that we can truly recognize our need for God's grace and mercy, and it is through humility that we can follow the example of Christ in serving others with love and compassion.
