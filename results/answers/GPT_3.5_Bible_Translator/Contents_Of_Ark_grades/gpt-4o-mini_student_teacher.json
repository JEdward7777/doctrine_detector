  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate answer detailing the items contained within the ark of the covenant, connecting them to God's covenant with the Israelites. The additional explanations provided by the student demonstrate a good understanding of the significance of these items in relation to God's presence and faithfulness. However, the student included an extra item (Aaron's rod) not mentioned in the reference answer, reducing the grade slightly. Otherwise, well done in linking the items to the theme of God's covenant with His people."
