## [Answer](../Contents_Of_Ark.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The ark of the covenant, described in the Bible, contained three main items:

1. The tablets of the Ten Commandments: God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai, and they were kept inside the ark as a symbol of God's covenant with the Israelites.

2. Aaron's rod: Aaron's rod that budded was placed inside the ark as a sign of God's choice of Aaron and his descendants as priests.

3. A jar of manna: A jar of manna, the bread from heaven that God provided for the Israelites in the wilderness, was also placed inside the ark as a reminder of God's provision for His people.

These items were kept in the Most Holy Place of the tabernacle and later the temple, representing God's presence among His people and His faithfulness to His covenant.
