The emphasis on measuring everything against the standard of God's Word, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, being aware of societal norms, and the importance of Christian community are all key aspects of a Christian worldview. The response could be further strengthened by providing specific examples of corrupt influences and how to address them, but overall, it demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
