  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer on how Christians can identify corrupt influences in the world around them. They emphasized the importance of measuring everything against the standard of God's Word, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, being aware of cultural norms, and surrounding oneself with a Christian community. While the student's answer aligns with the Christian worldview and addresses the concern, they could have directly linked the identification of corrupt influences to behaviors and attitudes that contradict biblical teachings, as highlighted in the reference answer."
