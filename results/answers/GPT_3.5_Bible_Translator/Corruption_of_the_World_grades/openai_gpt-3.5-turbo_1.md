# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
As Christians, we are called to be discerning and wise in identifying corrupt influences in the world around us. One way to do this is by measuring everything against the standard of God's Word, the Bible. The Word of God provides us with moral principles and values that help us discern right from wrong.

Additionally, we can seek guidance from the Holy Spirit who dwells within us as believers. The Holy Spirit helps us to recognize when something is not in alignment with God's will and guides us towards truth.

It is also important for Christians to be aware of the cultural and societal norms that may promote values contrary to the teachings of Jesus. By understanding the cultural context in which we live, we can better identify influences that are corrupt or harmful.

Finally, surrounding ourselves with a strong Christian community can provide accountability and support in discerning and avoiding corrupt influences. By staying connected with fellow believers who can encourage and challenge us in our faith, we can guard against being swayed by the pressures and temptations of the world.
