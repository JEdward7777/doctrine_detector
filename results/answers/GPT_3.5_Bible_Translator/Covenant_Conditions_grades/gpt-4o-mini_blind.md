## [Answer](../Covenant_Conditions.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, there are both conditional and unconditional covenants made by God with people.

An example of an unconditional covenant is the covenant God made with Abraham in Genesis 15:18. In this covenant, God promised to give Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession. This covenant was unconditional, meaning it did not depend on any action or response from Abraham. God promised to fulfill it regardless of Abraham's behavior.

On the other hand, there are conditional covenants in the Bible where God's promises are dependent on the actions or obedience of the people involved. One example is the Mosaic Covenant found in Exodus 19-24. In this covenant, God promised to bless the Israelites and make them His chosen people if they obeyed His commands and kept the covenant. However, if they disobeyed, there were consequences outlined as well.

Another example of a conditional covenant is found in Jeremiah 7:23-24, where God made a covenant with the Israelites, requiring them to obey His voice and walk in His ways. However, the people continued to rebel and disobey, leading to the covenant being broken and judgment being brought upon them.

These examples illustrate the different types of covenants in the Bible, showing that some are unconditional, based solely on God's faithfulness, while others are conditional, depending on the response and obedience of humans.

Comment: The response accurately identifies examples of both unconditional and conditional covenants in the Bible, citing specific passages and providing clear explanations. The explanation is doctrinally sound and effectively distinguishes between the two types of covenants. However, the response could be further strengthened by incorporating more references and elaborating on the theological significance of these covenants within the broader biblical narrative.
