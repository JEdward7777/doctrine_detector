  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the distinction between unconditional and conditional covenants in the Bible using specific examples and references. It demonstrates a clear understanding of how God's promises and expectations interact within these covenants from a Christian worldview. The response could have been further enhanced by including more references to additional biblical examples to strengthen the argument. Overall, a strong response that addresses the concern well."
