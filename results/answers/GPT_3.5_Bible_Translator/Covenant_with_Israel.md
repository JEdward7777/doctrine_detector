## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The covenant that God made with the people of Israel, also known as the Mosaic Covenant, was established through Moses on Mount Sinai. This covenant was a conditional agreement between God and the Israelites, laying out the terms of their relationship with Him.

The key components of the Mosaic Covenant included:
1. The giving of the Ten Commandments and other laws as a moral and ethical code for the Israelites to follow.
2. Promises of blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.
3. Regulations for worship, including the construction of the tabernacle and the establishment of the priesthood.
4. Provisions for sacrifice and atonement for sins through the sacrificial system.

Overall, the covenant was based on the premise that if the people of Israel obeyed God's commands and worshipped Him alone, they would experience His blessings and protection. However, if they disobeyed and turned to idolatry, they would face His judgment and discipline.

It's important to note that the Mosaic Covenant was a temporary arrangement, pointing forward to the ultimate covenant that would be fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the New Covenant. This New Covenant is based on grace and forgiveness through faith in Jesus, rather than strict adherence to the law.
