It effectively connects the Mosaic Covenant to the larger narrative of God's relationship with His chosen people throughout history. The mention of the temporary nature of the Mosaic Covenant and its fulfillment in Jesus Christ demonstrates an understanding of the overarching biblical narrative. However, it could further emphasize the significance of God's promises and the depth of His relationship with His chosen people through a Christian lens."
