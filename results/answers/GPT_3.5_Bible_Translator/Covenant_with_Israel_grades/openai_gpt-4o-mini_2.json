It also appropriately acknowledges the temporary nature of the Mosaic Covenant and its fulfillment in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ. However, it could have further emphasized the significance of the covenant in demonstrating God's faithfulness and love towards His chosen people, deepening the understanding of the relationship dynamics between God and the Israelites in the context of the covenant."
