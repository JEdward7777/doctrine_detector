The explanation of the beliefs held by ancient Jews and the transition of these views within early Christianity is clear and accurate. The mention of the Jerusalem Council and its significance is also appropriately highlighted. The response could be enhanced by incorporating specific biblical references to support the points made and by delving deeper into the theological implications of the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian community."
