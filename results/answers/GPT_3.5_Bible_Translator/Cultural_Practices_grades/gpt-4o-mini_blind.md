## [Answer](../Cultural_Practices.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In ancient Jewish culture, there was a deep-seated belief in the chosen status of the Jewish people as God's covenant people. This sometimes led to a view of Gentiles (non-Jews) as unclean or inferior, and there were cultural practices in place that reflected this view. For example, Jews would often avoid socializing with Gentiles, entering Gentile homes, or eating with Gentiles to maintain ritual purity.

Early Christianity emerged within a primarily Jewish context, and Jesus himself was Jewish. As Christianity began to spread to Gentile populations, there were differing views among early Christians on how to interact with Gentiles. Some early Jewish Christians, known as "Judaizers," advocated for Gentile converts to first become Jewish and follow Jewish customs, including circumcision and dietary laws. This was a point of contention in the early Christian community and led to the Jerusalem Council described in Acts 15.

Ultimately, the decision of the Jerusalem Council was that Gentile converts did not need to become Jewish in order to be Christian. This decision had a significant impact on early Christian practices, as it paved the way for the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian community without requiring them to adhere to Jewish cultural practices. As a result, early Christianity began to develop its own distinct culture and practices that were not solely based on Jewish traditions.

In summary, the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles as unclean or inferior had an impact on early Christian practices, particularly in terms of the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian community and the development of a distinct Christian culture separate from Jewish customs.
