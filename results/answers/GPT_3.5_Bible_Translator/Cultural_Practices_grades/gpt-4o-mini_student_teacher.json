  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80.\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. They accurately describe how the Jewish belief in chosen status influenced their interactions with Gentiles and how this influenced early Christian views. The student also effectively highlights the disagreements within the early Christian community regarding the inclusion of Gentiles and the decision of the Jerusalem Council.\n\nHowever, the student could enhance their answer by directly addressing the concern of how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices, as specified in the prompt. They should have explored in more depth how the cultural norms of avoiding Gentiles impacted the early Christian community's discussions on inclusivity and acceptance. Furthermore, the student could provide more specific examples or delve deeper into the implications of cultural practices on the development of early Christian practices.\n\nOverall, a solid response but with room for improvement in addressing the specified concern more directly."
