  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the cultural practice of avoiding Gentiles as unclean or inferior in ancient Jewish culture, which had an impact on early Christian practices. It also provides a clear explanation of how the Jerusalem Council's decision to include Gentile converts without requiring them to become Jewish led to the development of a distinct Christian culture. The summary effectively ties together the main points and highlights the significance of the cultural practice on the early Christian community.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger in terms of explicitly addressing the concern about how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices. While it is implied that the cultural practice of avoiding Gentiles had an impact on the early church, a more direct connection between the two would strengthen the response. Additionally, there may be some minor points to expand upon, such as exploring the implications of this cultural practice beyond the early Christian community or discussing how this issue relates to broader themes in Christian theology.\n\nComment: This is a solid response that effectively addresses the cultural practice and its impact on early Christianity. To take it to the next level, consider making more explicit connections between the cultural practice and the concern about how cultural norms influence faith communities, as well as exploring the implications of this issue beyond the early Christian community."
