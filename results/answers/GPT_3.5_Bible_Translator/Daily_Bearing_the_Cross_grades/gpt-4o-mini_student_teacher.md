In Luke 9:23, Jesus says, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me." 

Taking up your cross refers to a willingness to endure self-denial, suffering, and even persecution for the sake of following Jesus. Jesus is calling his disciples to prioritize their commitment to him above all else, even if it means facing trials or hardships.

As Christians, we are called to imitate Christ's sacrificial love and obedience, knowing that following Him may require us to go through difficulties or opposition. By taking up our cross daily and following Jesus, we show our dedication to Him and our willingness to walk in His ways, no matter the cost.
