The explanation given aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the sacrificial aspect of discipleship and the personal commitment required to follow Christ wholeheartedly. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of the call to discipleship and the personal cost involved in living out one's faith."
