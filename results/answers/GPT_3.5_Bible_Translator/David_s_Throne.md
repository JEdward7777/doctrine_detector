## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, the promise of David's throne lasting forever signifies the fulfillment of God's covenant with King David, as outlined in 2 Samuel 7:16: "Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever." Christians believe that this promise points to the eternal kingship of Jesus Christ, who is considered by many to be the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant.

According to the New Testament, Jesus is described as the "Son of David" and is seen as the rightful heir to the throne of David (Matthew 1:1, Luke 1:31-33). Christians believe that Jesus' resurrection and ascension to the right hand of God demonstrate his eternal reign and fulfillment of the promise that a descendant of David would rule forever.

Therefore, the promise of David's throne lasting forever in Christian theology symbolizes the continuity of God's plan of salvation throughout history and the ultimate reign of Jesus Christ as King of kings and Lord of lords.
