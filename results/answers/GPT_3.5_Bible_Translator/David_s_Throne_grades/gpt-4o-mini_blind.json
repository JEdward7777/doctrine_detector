The student effectively draws connections between the Old Testament promises to David and their fulfillment in Jesus Christ as the eternal King. The integration of relevant Bible verses and the emphasis on Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment demonstrate a strong understanding of Christian doctrine. Great job!"
