The connection between the promise, Jesus as the rightful heir to the throne of David, and the eternal reign of Christ is well-articulated, demonstrating a clear understanding of the significance of this promise in Christian belief. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the crucial role of recognizing Jesus as the fulfillment of God's plan through the promise to David."
