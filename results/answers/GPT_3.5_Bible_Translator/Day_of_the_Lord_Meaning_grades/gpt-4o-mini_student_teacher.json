  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that accurately explains the significance of the 'day of the Lord' in the New Testament, citing relevant scriptures and discussing its implications for believers. While the answer is detailed and well-structured, it goes beyond the specific reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's explanation is solid and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
