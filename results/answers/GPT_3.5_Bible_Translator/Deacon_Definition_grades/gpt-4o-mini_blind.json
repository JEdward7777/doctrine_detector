  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 80.\n\nWhile the answer is generally accurate in describing the practical aspects of a deacon's role in serving and supporting the congregation, it lacks emphasis on the spiritual responsibilities and qualifications of deacons as outlined in Scripture. A more comprehensive answer would also include the importance of deacons being servant-leaders, assisting in the administration of the church, and being role models of faithful living.\n\nOverall, the answer provides a good understanding of some aspects of a deacon's responsibilities but could benefit from a deeper exploration of the biblical foundations of the role."
