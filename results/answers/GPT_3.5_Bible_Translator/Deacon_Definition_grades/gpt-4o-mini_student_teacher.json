  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church by emphasizing the importance of serving and supporting the congregation in practical ways. The answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by focusing on practical assistance with food and money as part of the deacon's primary role. Overall, a strong understanding of the deacon's role in serving within the local church from a Christian worldview is demonstrated in this response."
