The primary role of a deacon in the local church is to serve and support the congregation in practical ways, particularly in areas of physical and material needs. This may involve assisting with the distribution of food and other resources to those in need, visiting and caring for the sick and elderly, and helping to maintain the church facilities. Deacons also assist the pastors and elders in the ministry of the church, but their primary emphasis is on serving and meeting the practical needs of the church and community.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately describes the primary role of a deacon in serving fellow believers with practical needs such as food or money. However, it would have been beneficial to expand on the biblical foundation of servanthood and how this role reflects Christ's example of humble service. A deeper discussion on the biblical principles of servanthood would have further strengthened the response.
