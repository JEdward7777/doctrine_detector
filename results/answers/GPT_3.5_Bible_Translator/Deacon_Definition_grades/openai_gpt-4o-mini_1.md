The primary role of a deacon in the local church is to serve and support the congregation in practical ways, particularly in areas of physical and material needs. This may involve assisting with the distribution of food and other resources to those in need, visiting and caring for the sick and elderly, and helping to maintain the church facilities. Deacons also assist the pastors and elders in the ministry of the church, but their primary emphasis is on serving and meeting the practical needs of the church and community.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response acknowledges the practical role of a deacon in serving fellow believers with practical needs such as food or money, which aligns with the Christian worldview of serving others. However, the response could be improved by expanding on the broader concept of servanthood in the church as reflected in the biblical teachings on humility, sacrificial love, and selflessness.
