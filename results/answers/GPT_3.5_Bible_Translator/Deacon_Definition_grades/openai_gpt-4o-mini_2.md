The primary role of a deacon in the local church is to serve and support the congregation in practical ways, particularly in areas of physical and material needs. This may involve assisting with the distribution of food and other resources to those in need, visiting and caring for the sick and elderly, and helping to maintain the church facilities. Deacons also assist the pastors and elders in the ministry of the church, but their primary emphasis is on serving and meeting the practical needs of the church and community.

Comment: The response acknowledges the practical aspect of a deacon's role in serving fellow believers with needs such as food or money, which aligns with the concern of understanding servanthood in the church. However, the answer could be improved by expanding on how servanthood in the context of biblical principles emphasizes humility, compassion, and love in serving others beyond just physical needs.
