## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian context, adultery is defined as a violation of the marital covenant between a man and a woman. The Bible explicitly condemns adultery in several passages, including the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:14 which states, "You shall not commit adultery." Additionally, Jesus reaffirms this commandment in the New Testament in Matthew 5:27-28, where he teaches that even looking at someone with lustful intent is considered adultery in the heart.

Adultery involves any form of sexual activity or emotional attachment outside of the bounds of marriage, thus betraying the commitment made between spouses and violating the trust and fidelity that are foundational to a healthy marriage. It is considered a serious sin in Christianity because it goes against God's design for marriage and the sanctity of the marital union.
