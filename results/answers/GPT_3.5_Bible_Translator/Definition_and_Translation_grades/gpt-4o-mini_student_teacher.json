  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained list of alternative translations for the term 'intercede' in Scripture, demonstrating a good understanding of the concept. The student effectively used Bible verses to support their choices and included a variety of alternative translations. The only room for improvement would be to include the teacher's reference answer for a more complete comparison."
