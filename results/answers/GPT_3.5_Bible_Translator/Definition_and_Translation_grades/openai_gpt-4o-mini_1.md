Intercede is a common term used in many English Bible translations to convey the idea of mediating or making a plea on behalf of someone else. In the original languages of the Bible, there are different words and phrases that can be translated as intercede or convey a similar meaning. Some alternative translations for the term 'intercede' as used in Scripture include:

1. Pray for - This can be found in 1 Timothy 2:1 which says, "First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people."

2. Advocate - This term is used in 1 John 2:1 where Jesus is referred to as our advocate with the Father.

3. Plead - This can be seen in Romans 8:34 where it says, "Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us."

4. Stand in the gap - Though not a direct translation, this term is often used to convey the idea of interceding on behalf of others, as seen in Ezekiel 22:30: "And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none."

5. Make a plea - This translation can be used to convey the idea of intercession, as seen in Job 9:33 where Job says, "There is no arbiter between us, to lay his hand on us both."

These alternative translations can help provide a broader understanding of the concept of intercession as presented in the Bible.
