  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 90. \n\nThe student accurately describes angels as spiritual beings created by God to serve and worship Him, and correctly identifies their role as messengers carrying out tasks on behalf of God. The student provides scriptural references to support their points, such as Isaiah 6:1-3 and Revelation 5:11-12, which is commendable. The answer could have been improved by delving deeper into the hierarchy of angels (e.g., archangels, cherubim, seraphim) and their specific roles as revealed in the Bible. Furthermore, explicitly mentioning the fallen angels or demons would have provided a more comprehensive view on the topic. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a good understanding of the biblical definition and primary role of angels."
