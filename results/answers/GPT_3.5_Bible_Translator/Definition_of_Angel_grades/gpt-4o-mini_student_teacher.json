  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive understanding of angels based on biblical teachings, acknowledging their role as messengers and agents of God's will. The student effectively highlights key aspects such as delivering messages, providing protection, and executing judgment. The inclusion of specific scripture references adds depth to the explanation. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on the primary role of angels as messengers, similar to the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong grasp of the concept with room for minor improvements in focus and conciseness."
