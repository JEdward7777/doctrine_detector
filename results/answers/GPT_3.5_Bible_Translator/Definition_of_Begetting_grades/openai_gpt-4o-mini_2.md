In a Biblical context, the term "beget" typically refers to the act of a father bringing a child into existence through procreation. It signifies the biological process of a father generating offspring, and is often used in genealogies to indicate the father-child relationship. In Christian theology, the term "beget" is also used in relation to the eternal relationship between God the Father and God the Son, as is mentioned in passages such as John 3:16 where Jesus is described as the "only begotten Son" of God.
