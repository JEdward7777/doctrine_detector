This belief is not just intellectual assent but also involves a personal relationship with Jesus, repentance from sin, and obedience to His teachings. Believers are those who have put their trust in Jesus for salvation, acknowledging Him as the Son of God who died for their sins and rose again from the dead. This belief results in a transformed life, marked by love for God and others, and a desire to live according to God's will. In essence, believers are those who have been born again and are indwelt by the Holy Spirit, guiding them in their walk of faith.
