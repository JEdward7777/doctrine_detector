It emphasizes the personal relationship, repentance, obedience, and transformation that come with genuine belief in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. The connection to being born again and indwelt by the Holy Spirit is apt and adds depth to the understanding of what it means to be a believer in Christ. A well-rounded and insightful response."
