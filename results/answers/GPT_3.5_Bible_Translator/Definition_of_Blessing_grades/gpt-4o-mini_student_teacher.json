  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer. The student effectively captured the essence of blessing in a Christian context by emphasizing invoking God's favor and goodness upon someone. The mention of prayers for guidance and peace, as well as the intention to uplift and support others, demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept. Overall, a strong response with minor room for improvement in clarifying the intent of blessing as causing good to happen as stated in the reference answer."
