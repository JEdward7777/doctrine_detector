## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the term "church" primarily refers to the gathering of followers of Jesus Christ. The Greek word used in the New Testament for "church" is "ekklesia," which literally means "the called-out ones" or "assembly." It is used to describe the community of believers who come together to worship, pray, learn, fellowship, and serve one another.

The concept of the church in the New Testament is not limited to a physical building or institution but is centered on the people who make up the body of Christ. The church is described as the bride of Christ (Ephesians 5:25-27), the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27), and the household of God (1 Timothy 3:15).

Through the church, believers are called to grow in faith, encourage one another, use their spiritual gifts to build up the body, and spread the message of the Gospel to the world. Jesus Christ Himself established the church and promised that the gates of Hell would not prevail against it (Matthew 16:18). Ultimately, the church is a sacred and vital part of God's plan for His people to come together in unity and love.
