The details about the church being the body of Christ, the bride of Christ, and the household of God are biblically sound and demonstrate a deep understanding of the church's theological significance. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the church's role as a community of believers united in faith rather than solely a physical structure. Great job!"
