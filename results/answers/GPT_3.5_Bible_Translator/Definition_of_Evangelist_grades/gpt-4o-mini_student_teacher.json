  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the literal meaning of the term \"evangelist\" and accurately described the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel from a Christian perspective. The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer given by the teacher. The grade is slightly reduced due to minor wording differences from the reference answer."
