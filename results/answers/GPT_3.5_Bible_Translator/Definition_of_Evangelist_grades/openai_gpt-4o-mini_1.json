It also touches on the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel by spreading the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ through preaching, teaching, and sharing the good news of salvation. However, it could be strengthened by elaborating more on the importance and impact of evangelists in fulfilling the Great Commission and leading others to Christ."
