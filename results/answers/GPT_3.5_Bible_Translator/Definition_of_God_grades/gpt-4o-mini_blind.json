They have covered key attributes such as infinitude, eternality, omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, holiness, justice, love, mercy, grace, compassion, and the triune nature of God. The answer also correctly emphasizes God's role as the creator, sustainer, and sovereign ruler worthy of worship. Well done with doctrinal correctness."
