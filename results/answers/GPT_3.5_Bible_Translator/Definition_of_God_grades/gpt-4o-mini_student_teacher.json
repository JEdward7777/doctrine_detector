  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 85.\n\nThe student's answer covers most of the key characteristics and nature of God as defined in the Bible. They correctly mention God's attributes such as being infinite, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, immutable, holy, just, loving, merciful, gracious, and compassionate. Additionally, they acknowledge the triune nature of God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. However, the student could improve their answer by emphasizing God's righteousness and sinlessness more explicitly, as these qualities are essential in understanding God's nature accurately."
