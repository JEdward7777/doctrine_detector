## [Answer](../Definition_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible describes God as being infinite, eternal, omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful), omnipresent (present everywhere), and immutable (unchanging). God is also described as being holy, just, loving, merciful, gracious, and compassionate. The Bible teaches that God is a triune God, existing in three persons: Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit. God is the creator of all things, the sustainer of the universe, and the source of all life. He is sovereign and in control of all things, and is worthy of worship, honor, and praise.
