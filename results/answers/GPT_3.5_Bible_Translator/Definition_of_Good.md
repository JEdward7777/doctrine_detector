## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Bible, 'good' is defined as that which is in alignment with God's character and will. Goodness is rooted in God's holiness, righteousness, love, and mercy. In contrast, 'evil' is that which is contrary to God's nature and opposes His character and will. Evil is often associated with sin, rebellion against God, darkness, and immorality.

The Bible teaches that God is the ultimate source of all that is good, and that evil entered the world through the disobedience of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). Throughout Scripture, there is a clear distinction between good and evil, with God calling His people to choose the path of righteousness and reject sin.

Ultimately, the Bible teaches that God will judge evil and conquer it with His goodness and justice. Christians are called to resist evil, do good, and trust in God's power to overcome darkness.
