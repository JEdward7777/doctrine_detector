  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a strong and detailed explanation of how the Biblical definition of 'good' contrasts with 'evil' by emphasizing the alignment with God's character and will. The answer also addresses the moral implications by discussing sin, righteousness, and the consequences of disobedience. However, the student's answer could have been improved by incorporating the teacher's reference answer, which focused on defining 'good' as morally right, emotionally pleasant, and beneficial, and contrasting it with 'evil' as moral wrongness. Integrating these aspects would have further enriched the student's response."
