  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the Christian perspective on defining 'good' and 'evil' based on God's character and will. It addresses the moral implications of these concepts in daily decision-making by emphasizing the importance of aligning one's choices with righteousness and rejecting sin. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the connection between the source of goodness being rooted in God's nature, which is crucial in a Christian worldview. Overall, a strong response."
