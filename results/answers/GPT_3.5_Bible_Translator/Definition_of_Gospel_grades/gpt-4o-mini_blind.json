  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"gospel\" both in its literal meaning and its contextual understanding within the Bible. The student effectively connects the term to the four Gospels in the New Testament and expands on its broader theological significance in conveying the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. However, to enhance the answer further, the student could have referenced the Greek term \"euangelion\" from which \"gospel\" is derived, adding a layer of linguistic context. Additionally, incorporating scriptural references or quotes from the Gospels themselves could have added depth to the explanation."
