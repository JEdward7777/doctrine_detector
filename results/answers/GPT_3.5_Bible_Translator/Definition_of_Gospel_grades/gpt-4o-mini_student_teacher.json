  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a clear explanation of the term \"gospel\" both in its literal meaning and in the context of the Bible. They accurately discuss the significance of the Gospels in recounting the life of Jesus Christ and also touch on the broader theological understanding of the gospel message in Christian faith. The student effectively captures the essence of the gospel as the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ, although there is some additional information beyond the reference answer that slightly detracts from the focus. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
