## [Answer](../Definition_of_Gospel.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "gospel" literally means "good news" or "message of joy." In the context of the Bible, the term specifically refers to the four books of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) that recount the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. These books are often referred to as the "Gospels." 

Additionally, the term "gospel" is used more broadly in Christian theology to refer to the central message of the Christian faith - the good news that God offers salvation and forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ. This message emphasizes the love, grace, and mercy of God, and urges people to repent of their sins and turn to faith in Jesus as their savior. In summary, the gospel is the core message of Christianity that proclaims salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
