  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible, highlighting its connection to God's holiness and Jesus Christ's divine nature. The response effectively conveys the separation of God from sin and emphasizes His purity and authority. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of holiness in the Bible, though a slight deduction is made for not explicitly specifying that the term 'Holy One' almost always refers to God as per the teacher's reference answer."
