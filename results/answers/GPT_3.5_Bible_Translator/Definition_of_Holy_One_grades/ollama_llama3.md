In the Bible, the term "Holy One" is used to refer to God or Jesus Christ as completely separate and set apart from sin and evil. It emphasizes the perfect purity, righteousness, and sacredness of God. The title "Holy One" conveys the truth that God is without fault, sin, or imperfection, and is worthy of reverence, awe, and worship.

In the Old Testament, the Hebrew term “qadosh” is often translated as “Holy One” and is used to describe God’s nature and character. For example, in Psalm 71:22, it says, "I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel."

In the New Testament, Jesus is also referred to as the Holy One. In Luke 4:34, a demon acknowledges Jesus as "the Holy One of God." This title highlights Jesus' divine nature and perfect righteousness as the Son of God.

Overall, the term "Holy One" in the Bible emphasizes the purity, holiness, and perfection of God and Jesus Christ, and serves as a reminder of their incomparable nature and authority.
