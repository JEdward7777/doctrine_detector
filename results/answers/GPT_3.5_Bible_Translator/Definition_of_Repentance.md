In the Bible, repentance is a key concept that involves acknowledging one's sin, turning away from it, and turning towards God. It encompasses a change of heart, mind, and actions. 

Repentance is essential for receiving forgiveness and experiencing God's grace. In the New Testament, Jesus often calls people to repent as he preaches the good news of the Kingdom of God. For example, in Mark 1:15, Jesus says, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."

True repentance involves:

1. Recognizing and confessing sin: This includes acknowledging wrongdoing and being genuinely sorry for it. 
2. Turning away from sin: Repentance involves a change of direction, forsaking sinful behavior and striving to live in obedience to God's will.
3. Seeking forgiveness: Repentance involves asking God for forgiveness and trusting in His mercy and grace.
4. Bearing fruit in keeping with repentance: Repentance is evidenced by a transformed life, marked by love, humility, and obedience to God's commands.

Ultimately, repentance is a gift from God that leads to salvation, reconciliation with God, and the experience of His redemptive love and grace.
