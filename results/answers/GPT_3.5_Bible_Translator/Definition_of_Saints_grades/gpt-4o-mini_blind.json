It correctly emphasizes that saints are all believers in Jesus Christ, not just those who have performed extraordinary deeds. The mention of being set apart and sanctified by God aligns well with Christian doctrine. The only potential improvement could be to elaborate more on the concept of sanctification in relation to saints, but overall, this is a strong and doctrinally sound response."
