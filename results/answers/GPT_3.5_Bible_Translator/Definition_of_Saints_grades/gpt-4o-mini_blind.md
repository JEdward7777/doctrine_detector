In the New Testament, the term "saints" refers to all individuals who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and are part of the body of believers, the Church. Saints are not just those who have lived extraordinary lives of holiness or performed miracles but are ordinary followers of Christ who are set apart and sanctified by God. They are referred to as saints because they are considered holy and set apart for God's purposes. The apostle Paul often addressed his letters to the "saints" in various churches, emphasizing the believers' identity as God's chosen and sanctified people.

Comment: This answer provides a solid explanation of the term "saints" in the context of the New Testament. It correctly emphasizes that saints are all believers in Jesus Christ, not just those who have performed extraordinary deeds. The mention of being set apart and sanctified by God aligns well with Christian doctrine. The only potential improvement could be to elaborate more on the concept of sanctification in relation to saints, but overall, this is a strong and doctrinally sound response.
