  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80. \n\nThe answer provided by the student demonstrates a good understanding of the term \"saints\" in the New Testament context and correctly highlights that saints are all individuals who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. They also emphasize the concept of being set apart and sanctified by God. However, the student's answer includes additional information, such as the mention of performing miracles or living extraordinary lives of holiness, which may bring in some cultural interpretations and stray slightly from the provided reference answer, which states that saints are simply believers in Jesus and means 'holy ones'. \n\nOverall, the student's answer is clear, well-written, and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic while incorporating additional insights."
