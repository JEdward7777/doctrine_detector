The explanation emphasizes the inclusivity of the term, encompassing ordinary followers of Christ rather than just those with extraordinary lives. Additionally, the connection to Paul's letters addressing the saints reinforces the connection between the term and the community of believers. \n\nWhile the answer is comprehensive, it could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of sanctification within Christianity. This would strengthen the connection between the idea of being set apart and the idea of being made holy by God."
