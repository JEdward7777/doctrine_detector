## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the term "saints" refers to all individuals who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and are part of the body of believers, the Church. Saints are not just those who have lived extraordinary lives of holiness or performed miracles but are ordinary followers of Christ who are set apart and sanctified by God. They are referred to as saints because they are considered holy and set apart for God's purposes. The apostle Paul often addressed his letters to the "saints" in various churches, emphasizing the believers' identity as God's chosen and sanctified people.

**Comments:**

The student's answer accurately defines the Biblical meaning of "saints" as "holy ones" and clarifies that it refers to believers in Jesus. The explanation emphasizes the inclusivity of the term, encompassing ordinary followers of Christ rather than just those with extraordinary lives. Additionally, the connection to Paul's letters addressing the saints reinforces the connection between the term and the community of believers. 

While the answer is comprehensive, it could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of sanctification within Christianity. This would strengthen the connection between the idea of being set apart and the idea of being made holy by God.
