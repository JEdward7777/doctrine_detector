In the New Testament, the term "saints" refers to all individuals who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and are part of the body of believers, the Church. Saints are not just those who have lived extraordinary lives of holiness or performed miracles but are ordinary followers of Christ who are set apart and sanctified by God. They are referred to as saints because they are considered holy and set apart for God's purposes. The apostle Paul often addressed his letters to the "saints" in various churches, emphasizing the believers' identity as God's chosen and sanctified people.
