It accurately conveys the concept of being set apart and made holy for God's purposes, with references to key verses such as 1 Thessalonians 4:3 and John 17:17. The emphasis on sanctification as a continual process throughout a believer's life, involving transformation into the likeness of Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit, is doctrinally sound. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps delve a bit more into the role of faith in sanctification, but overall, this is a well-written and informed response."
