## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
To sanctify, or be sanctified, according to the Bible, is to be set apart and made holy for God's purposes. The process of sanctification begins at the moment of salvation when a person is set apart as a child of God and continues throughout the believer's life as they are continually transformed more into the likeness of Christ.

1 Thessalonians 4:3 says, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification..." This indicates that sanctification is God's will for every believer.

In John 17:17, Jesus prays for His disciples, "Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth." This verse shows that sanctification is closely tied to being set apart by and growing in the truth of God's word.

As believers yield to the Holy Spirit and allow Him to work in their lives, they are sanctified in their thoughts, words, and actions, becoming more like Christ. This process involves being purified from sin, growing in holiness, and being dedicated to God's service.

Ultimately, sanctification is a work of God in the life of a believer, as they cooperate with the Holy Spirit, striving to live in obedience to God and His word. It is a lifelong journey of growth in faith and likeness to Christ.

Comment: This answer provides a solid explanation of sanctification according to the Bible. It accurately conveys the concept of being set apart and made holy for God's purposes, with references to key verses such as 1 Thessalonians 4:3 and John 17:17. The emphasis on sanctification as a continual process throughout a believer's life, involving transformation into the likeness of Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit, is doctrinally sound. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps delve a bit more into the role of faith in sanctification, but overall, this is a well-written and informed response.
