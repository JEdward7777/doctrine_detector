  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-developed and detailed explanation of sanctification according to the Bible, incorporating relevant Bible verses to support their points. They accurately described sanctification as being set apart and made holy for God's purposes, with a focus on the ongoing process of transformation into the likeness of Christ. The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer given by the teacher. However, the student could have further emphasized the key aspect of sanctification being a work of God through the Holy Spirit in the believer's life."
