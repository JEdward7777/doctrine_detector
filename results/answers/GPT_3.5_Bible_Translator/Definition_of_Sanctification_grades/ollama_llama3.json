  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise definition of sanctification, citing biblical examples to support its explanation. It correctly identifies sanctification as a process of being made holy and set apart for God's purposes. The inclusion of specific verses (1 Thessalonians 4:3 and John 17:17) helps to establish the scriptural basis for this understanding.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because this response could be more comprehensive in its exploration of sanctification. For example, it could have discussed the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification or provided additional biblical examples to illustrate the process. Additionally, while the response is clear and concise, it may benefit from more development and elaboration on some of the key points.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical definition of sanctification, but could be improved with further expansion and illustration."
