## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
To sanctify, or be sanctified, according to the Bible, is to be set apart and made holy for God's purposes. The process of sanctification begins at the moment of salvation when a person is set apart as a child of God and continues throughout the believer's life as they are continually transformed more into the likeness of Christ.

1 Thessalonians 4:3 says, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification..." This indicates that sanctification is God's will for every believer.

In John 17:17, Jesus prays for His disciples, "Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth." This verse shows that sanctification is closely tied to being set apart by and growing in the truth of God's word.

As believers yield to the Holy Spirit and allow Him to work in their lives, they are sanctified in their thoughts, words, and actions, becoming more like Christ. This process involves being purified from sin, growing in holiness, and being dedicated to God's service.

Ultimately, sanctification is a work of God in the life of a believer, as they cooperate with the Holy Spirit, striving to live in obedience to God and His word. It is a lifelong journey of growth in faith and likeness to Christ.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 80.

The response provides a clear and concise definition of sanctification, citing biblical examples to support its explanation. It correctly identifies sanctification as a process of being made holy and set apart for God's purposes. The inclusion of specific verses (1 Thessalonians 4:3 and John 17:17) helps to establish the scriptural basis for this understanding.

However, I deduct points because this response could be more comprehensive in its exploration of sanctification. For example, it could have discussed the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification or provided additional biblical examples to illustrate the process. Additionally, while the response is clear and concise, it may benefit from more development and elaboration on some of the key points.

Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical definition of sanctification, but could be improved with further expansion and illustration.
