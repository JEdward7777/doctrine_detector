In the Bible, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord. Proverbs 9:10 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." This means that true wisdom begins with reverence and respect for God. 

Wisdom in the biblical sense involves living according to God's principles and values, making decisions based on God's Word, and seeking to understand and follow His will. It is not just about intellectual knowledge or cleverness, but about living a life that is pleasing to God and aligned with His purposes.

A wise person is someone who listens to and obeys God, seeks His guidance in all things, and lives with integrity and humility. Proverbs is a great book in the Bible that offers many insights into what it means to be wise and how to live a life that is pleasing to God.
