  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of biblical wisdom, emphasizing the fear of the Lord as the foundation of wisdom. They correctly highlight the importance of living according to God's principles, seeking His will, and embodying qualities such as integrity and humility. The mention of Proverbs as a source of wisdom is also commendable. However, the response could have been strengthened by delving further into how the fear of the Lord manifests in daily life and the transformative impact of wisdom on one's character and relationships. Overall, a good effort with room for deeper exploration."
