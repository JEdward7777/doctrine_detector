  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical concept of wisdom by highlighting the importance of the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom, living according to God's principles, seeking God's guidance, and living a life aligned with God's purposes. They also emphasize the importance of integrity, humility, and obedience to God in demonstrating wisdom. While the student's answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, they could have elaborated further on specific examples or practical ways in which one can apply biblical wisdom in decision-making scenarios. Overall, the student has shown a good grasp of the biblical definition of wisdom and its implications for daily living."
