## Question [Definition of Wisdom](../../../questions/Definition_of_Wisdom.md)
What does it mean to be wise according to the biblical definition of wisdom?

## Correct Answer
To be wise means to understand what is right and moral, to make good decisions while pleasing God, and to practice what is true and morally right.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the biblical concept of wisdom is crucial for making decisions that align with God's will.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Wisdom.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord. Proverbs 9:10 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." This means that true wisdom begins with reverence and respect for God. 

Wisdom in the biblical sense involves living according to God's principles and values, making decisions based on God's Word, and seeking to understand and follow His will. It is not just about intellectual knowledge or cleverness, but about living a life that is pleasing to God and aligned with His purposes.

A wise person is someone who listens to and obeys God, seeks His guidance in all things, and lives with integrity and humility. Proverbs is a great book in the Bible that offers many insights into what it means to be wise and how to live a life that is pleasing to God.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 85.

The response generally aligns well with the biblical concept of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of fearing God, seeking His guidance, and living according to His principles and values. The mention of Proverbs as a source of wisdom is also relevant and supportive of the biblical understanding.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved to more fully align with the concern:

1. While the response mentions pleasing God, it would be helpful to explicitly state how this relates to making decisions that align with God's will.
2. The response could benefit from more specific examples or illustrations of what it means to live wisely in a way that is pleasing to God.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical concept of wisdom and its importance in decision-making. With some refinement to address the areas mentioned above, it could be an even stronger response.

Comment: The main area for improvement is explicitly connecting the dots between pleasing God and making decisions that align with His will. Additionally, providing more concrete examples or illustrations would help bring the biblical concept of wisdom to life.
