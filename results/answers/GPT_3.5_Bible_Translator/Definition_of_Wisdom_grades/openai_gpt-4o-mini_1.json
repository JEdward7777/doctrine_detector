The incorporation of Proverbs and the emphasis on living a life pleasing to God are commendable. The only minor suggestion would be to explicitly tie the concept of understanding what is right and moral back to the fear of the Lord and seeking God's guidance, to strengthen the connection between wisdom and God's will."
