  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the biblical definition of a Christian based on Scripture, emphasizing the importance of belief in and following Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. The student correctly highlights the personal relationship aspect of being a Christian and includes key components such as faith, repentance, and obedience to Jesus. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate additional scriptural references to further support the points made."
