  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of what a miracle is and how it relates to God's authority from a Christian worldview. The student accurately describes miracles as extraordinary events that defy natural laws and highlight God's intervention and sovereignty. The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian teachings on miracles as manifestations of God's authority. However, to improve the grade, the student could have cited specific examples of miracles from the Bible to further illustrate their point."
