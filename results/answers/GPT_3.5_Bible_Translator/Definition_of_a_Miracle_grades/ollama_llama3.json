  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response captures the essence of what a miracle is, highlighting its extraordinary nature and connection to divine intervention. The mention of God's all-powerful nature and complete authority over the universe is also in line with the concern about understanding God's power and deepening our faith.\n\nThe only areas where this response could be improved are:\n\n* Lack of biblical examples or specific instances where miracles have occurred\n* Limited exploration of the significance of miracles beyond simply showcasing God's power (although it does touch on this aspect)\n* No direct mention of how miracles can deepen our faith and acknowledgment of God's power, although it is implied\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the concept of miracles in a Christian context."
