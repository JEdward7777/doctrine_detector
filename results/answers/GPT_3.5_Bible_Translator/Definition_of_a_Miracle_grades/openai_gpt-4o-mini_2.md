A miracle is an extraordinary event that is unexplainable by natural or scientific laws, and is attributed to divine intervention. Throughout the Bible, miracles are often performed by God or through the power of God to demonstrate His authority, power, and sovereignty over creation.

Miracles serve as a visible confirmation of God's authority and existence, and they often accompany significant moments in the Bible where God is performing a special work or fulfilling a specific purpose. Miracles can include things like healing the sick, raising the dead, controlling the elements, or feeding a multitude with a small amount of food.

In essence, miracles are a manifestation of God's authority over the natural order and serve as a powerful reminder of His presence and power in the world. They attest to the fact that God is sovereign and can transcend the laws of nature at His will, demonstrating His divine authority and the truth of His Word.
