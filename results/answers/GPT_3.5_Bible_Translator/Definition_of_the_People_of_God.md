## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Old Testament, being considered one of the 'people of God' means that someone is part of the chosen nation of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God made a covenant with the Israelites, promising to be their God and to bless them as his chosen people if they obeyed his commandments and worshipped him alone. 

Being one of the 'people of God' meant following the laws and rituals outlined in the Torah, observing the Sabbath, and participating in worship activities such as sacrifices and festivals. It also meant being set apart from other nations as a holy people, called to be a light to the world and reflect God's character and values. 

Ultimately, being part of the 'people of God' in the Old Testament carried both privileges and responsibilities, as God's chosen ones were expected to live in obedience and faithfulness to Him.
