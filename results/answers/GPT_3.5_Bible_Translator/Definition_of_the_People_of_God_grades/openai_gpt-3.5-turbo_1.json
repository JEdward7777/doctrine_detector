It effectively addresses the concern by outlining how God made a covenant with the Israelites, including the promises and expectations involved. The interconnectedness of obedience, worship, and being set apart as a holy people is well articulated. Overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding of the covenant relationship God established with Israel."
