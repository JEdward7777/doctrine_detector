It correctly identifies demons as fallen angels and emphasizes the authority of Jesus and the power of God in combating demonic influence. The focus on reliance on prayer, fasting, and God's Word is commendable. One point of improvement could be to include references to specific Biblical passages that illustrate demon possession and the actions taken to address it. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
