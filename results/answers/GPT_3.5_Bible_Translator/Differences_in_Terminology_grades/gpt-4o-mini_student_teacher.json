  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the terms 'exhort,' 'encourage,' and 'admonish' in relation to Christian theology, capturing their nuances effectively. However, while the student's answer is detailed and insightful, it could be improved by aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by focusing on the specific biblical definitions and distinctions between the terms, especially in the context of scripture. Overall, a strong effort with room for slight refinement."
