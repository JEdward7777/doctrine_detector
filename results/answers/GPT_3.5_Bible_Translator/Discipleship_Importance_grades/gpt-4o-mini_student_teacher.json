  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that covers various aspects of why the twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus. They successfully highlighted the apostles' role in continuing Jesus' ministry and spreading the Gospel, as well as the symbolic significance of the number twelve. However, the answer could have been more focused on the specific concern of understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. Despite this minor deviation, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic."
