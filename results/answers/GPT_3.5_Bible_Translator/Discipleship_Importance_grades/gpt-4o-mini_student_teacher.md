## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus to be his closest disciples for several reasons:

1. Jesus needed a group of dedicated individuals to carry on his teachings and ministry after his departure. The apostles were chosen to continue spreading the message of the Gospel to all nations.

2. The number twelve has symbolic significance in Jewish tradition, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. By choosing twelve apostles, Jesus was symbolically reconstituting the people of God around himself as the new Israel.

3. The apostles were witnesses to Jesus' teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection. They were chosen to be eyewitnesses of these events and to testify to others about what they had seen and experienced.

4. Jesus recognized the potential in each of the apostles to be transformed and empowered by the Holy Spirit to carry out his mission effectively. Despite their flaws and shortcomings, Jesus saw their potential to become strong leaders in the early Christian church.

Overall, the selection of the twelve apostles reflects Jesus' intention to establish a community of believers who would carry on his mission and spread the Gospel to all corners of the earth.
