The twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus to be his closest disciples for several reasons:

1. Jesus needed a group of dedicated individuals to carry on his teachings and ministry after his departure. The apostles were chosen to continue spreading the message of the Gospel to all nations.

2. The number twelve has symbolic significance in Jewish tradition, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. By choosing twelve apostles, Jesus was symbolically reconstituting the people of God around himself as the new Israel.

3. The apostles were witnesses to Jesus' teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection. They were chosen to be eyewitnesses of these events and to testify to others about what they had seen and experienced.

4. Jesus recognized the potential in each of the apostles to be transformed and empowered by the Holy Spirit to carry out his mission effectively. Despite their flaws and shortcomings, Jesus saw their potential to become strong leaders in the early Christian church.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a solid foundation for understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. It correctly identifies Jesus' selection of the twelve apostles as being for their unique call to spread his teachings and establish the foundation of the early Church. The response also touches on some of the symbolic significance of the number twelve, referencing Jewish tradition and its representation of the twelve tribes of Israel.

However, while the response provides a good overview, it could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation. For example, it does not fully explore the apostles' role as eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, nor does it delve deeper into their individual characteristics and strengths that made them suitable for this calling.

Overall, while there is room for improvement, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the basic reasons behind Jesus' selection of the twelve apostles.
