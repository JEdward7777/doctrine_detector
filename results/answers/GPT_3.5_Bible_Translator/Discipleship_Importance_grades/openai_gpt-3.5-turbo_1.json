The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of the apostles in the New Testament, drawing on their witness to Jesus' teachings, their symbolic representation of the new Israel, and their empowerment by the Holy Spirit. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention the apostles' role in carrying on Jesus' mission and spreading the Gospel, as this is a key aspect of their significance in the New Testament."
