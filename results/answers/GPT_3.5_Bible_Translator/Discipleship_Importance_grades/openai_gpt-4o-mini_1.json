The answer effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the apostles' role in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the foundation of the early Church. The response also delves into the symbolic and theological implications of Jesus selecting twelve apostles. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps delve a bit deeper into the specific contributions of each apostle in the New Testament narrative, but overall, this is a strong and well-rounded explanation."
