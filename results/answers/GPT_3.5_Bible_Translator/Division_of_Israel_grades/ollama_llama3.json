  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60%\n\nComment: The response provides a basic understanding of the historical event of the division of Israel into two kingdoms, but lacks depth and context. It does not explicitly mention the significance of this event, which is a major concern in this evaluation. While the answer matches the key points mentioned in the given answer, it does not provide any insight into the spiritual implications of this division or its impact on the people of God. To increase the score, the response could have explored the theological and biblical themes surrounding this event, such as the consequences of disobedience, the rise of idolatry, or the importance of maintaining faithfulness to God."
