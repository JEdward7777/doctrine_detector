After King Solomon's reign, the kingdom of Israel divided into two separate kingdoms: the northern kingdom of Israel with its capital in Samaria, and the southern kingdom of Judah with its capital in Jerusalem. This division occurred around 930 BC following the reign of Solomon's son, Rehoboam. The northern kingdom of Israel eventually fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC, while the southern kingdom of Judah was later conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BC.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the division of Israel into two kingdoms after King Solomon, mentioning the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. However, it lacks details about the timeline and the eventual conquests by the Assyrians and Babylonians. It could have been improved by including more depth on the historical and spiritual significance of this division from a Christian worldview perspective.
