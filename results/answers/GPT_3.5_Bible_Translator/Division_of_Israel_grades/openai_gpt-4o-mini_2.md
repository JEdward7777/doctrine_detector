After King Solomon's reign, the kingdom of Israel divided into two separate kingdoms: the northern kingdom of Israel with its capital in Samaria, and the southern kingdom of Judah with its capital in Jerusalem. This division occurred around 930 BC following the reign of Solomon's son, Rehoboam. The northern kingdom of Israel eventually fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC, while the southern kingdom of Judah was later conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BC.
