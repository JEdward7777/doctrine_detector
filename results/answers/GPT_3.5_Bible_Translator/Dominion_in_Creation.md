## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches in Genesis 1:26-28 that God created humanity in His image and gave them dominion over all the earth and its creatures. This dominion is not to be understood as domination or exploitation, but rather as responsible stewardship. In Genesis 2:15, we see that God placed Adam in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. This implies a role of caretaking and tending to the earth, rather than abusing it for selfish gain.

As stewards of God's creation, we are called to care for and preserve the earth and all its resources. This means using our abilities and resources wisely, in a way that honors God and benefits both present and future generations. We are to exercise dominion in a way that reflects God's character of love, justice, and mercy towards all His creation.

Ultimately, our role as stewards of the earth is a sacred responsibility given to us by God, and we are called to fulfill it in a way that honors Him and His creation.
