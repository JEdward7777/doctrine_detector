## [Answer](../Duration_of_the_Last_Days.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the "last days" refer to the time period leading up to the second coming of Christ and the final judgment. The exact duration of the last days is not specified in terms of years or specific time frames. However, the concept of the last days is characterized by signs and events that indicate the imminent return of Christ, such as moral decay, natural disasters, wars, and the spread of the gospel to all nations.

Scriptures such as 2 Timothy 3:1-5 and 2 Peter 3:3-4 speak of the last days as a time of great difficulty and skepticism. While we do not know the exact duration of the last days, we are urged to live in a state of readiness, being faithful and diligent in our relationship with God and in sharing the gospel with others.

Ultimately, the Bible teaches that God's timing is perfect and that the exact timing of the last days is known only to Him. Our focus should be on living with faith and obedience, trusting in God's sovereignty and his promise of Christ's return.
