It correctly points out that the uncertainty of the duration should not hinder Christians from living out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return, as they are called to be faithful and diligent in their relationship with God. This aligns well with a Christian worldview, but could have further emphasized the urgency for believers to actively live out their faith in light of the uncertainty of the timing of Christ's return."
