  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student effectively explains the story of Gideon's creation of a gold ephod and the subsequent idolatry of the Israelites, highlighting the dangers of departing from true worship of God. They emphasize the importance of remaining faithful to God and not allowing anything to take His place in our lives. The student also correctly identifies the temptation to idolize objects or symbols, stressing the seriousness of idolatry.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could have been strengthened by explicitly tying the story back to the concern provided, which emphasized the importance of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith. By directly connecting the lesson learned to this concern, the student could have provided a more thorough and cohesive response."
