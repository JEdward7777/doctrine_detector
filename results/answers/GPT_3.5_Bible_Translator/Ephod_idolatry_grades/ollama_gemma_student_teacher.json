  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that effectively analyzes the story of Gideon's ephod and its lessons on idolatry. The student clearly demonstrates an understanding of the biblical context and applies it to the issue of material representations of faith. The response also highlights the importance of prioritizing God and avoiding the temptation to elevate anything else above true worship."
