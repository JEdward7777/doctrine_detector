  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Based on a Christian worldview, I would grade this response as 90.\n\nThe response effectively captures the lesson learned from the story of Gideon's ephod, emphasizing the danger of allowing objects associated with worship to become idols that distract from true worship of God. The importance of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith is clearly communicated. The overall interpretation aligns well with Christian teachings on idolatry and the centrality of God in worship. Great job addressing the concern provided!"
