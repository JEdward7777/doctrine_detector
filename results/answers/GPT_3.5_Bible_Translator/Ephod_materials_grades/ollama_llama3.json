  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe student correctly identifies the main materials used to construct the high priest's ephod, including gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and fine linen. They also mention the onyx stones being engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. However, they do not specifically state that the ephod was embroidered, which is a key point in understanding its design and symbolism.\n\nThe response does touch on the significance of the materials used, as it highlights their importance in worship. The student could have expanded more on this aspect to further emphasize the concern's focus on the importance of design and symbolism.\n\nComment: While the student provides some accurate information about the ephod's construction, they could improve by being more precise with their language and expanding on the significance of the materials used."
