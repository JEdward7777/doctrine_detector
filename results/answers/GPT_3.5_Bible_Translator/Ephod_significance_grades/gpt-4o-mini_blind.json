  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a solid response that accurately explains the significance of the high priest's ephod in the context of Old Testament worship. The student effectively covers the materials, design, and purpose of the ephod, as well as its symbolic meaning in relation to the high priest's role as a mediator between God and the people of Israel. One improvement could be to also mention the breastpiece of judgment that was connected to the ephod, emphasizing the high priest's role in making decisions based on God's guidance. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound explanation."
