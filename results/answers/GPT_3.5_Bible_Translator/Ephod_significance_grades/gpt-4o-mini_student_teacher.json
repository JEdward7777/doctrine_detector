  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the high priest's ephod in the context of Old Testament worship. They correctly mentioned the materials, design, and specific features of the ephod, as well as its symbolic significance in representing the high priest's role as a mediator and intercessor. However, the student could have emphasized more explicitly the connection between the ephod and the priest's role in mediating between God and the people, as well as the use of the Urim and Thummim. Despite this slight oversight, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic."
