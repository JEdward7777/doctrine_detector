## [Answer](../Ephod_significance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The ephod worn by the high priest in the Old Testament was a significant part of the priestly garments as described in the book of Exodus (Exodus 28:6-14). The ephod was a vest-like garment made of finely woven linen, adorned with gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarns. On the shoulders of the ephod were two onyx stones engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, serving as a reminder to the high priest of his responsibility to represent the entire nation before God.

The ephod, along with other priestly garments, symbolized the authority and holiness of the high priest as he carried out his duties in the tabernacle or temple. The ephod was also used for seeking guidance from God through the Urim and Thummim, which were placed in a pouch on the ephod (Exodus 28:30). These objects were used by the high priest to discern God's will in certain matters.

Overall, the ephod served as a visible symbol of the high priest's role as mediator between God and the people of Israel. It emphasized the importance of the high priest's intercessory role in offering sacrifices for the atonement of sins and seeking God's guidance for the nation.
