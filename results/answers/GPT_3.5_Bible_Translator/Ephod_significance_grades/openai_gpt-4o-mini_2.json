The explanation aligns well with a Christian worldview, highlighting the importance of the high priest's intercessory role in offering sacrifices for the atonement of sins. The response effectively addresses the concern by enhancing understanding of the Old Testament priesthood and worship practices through the discussion of the ephod."
