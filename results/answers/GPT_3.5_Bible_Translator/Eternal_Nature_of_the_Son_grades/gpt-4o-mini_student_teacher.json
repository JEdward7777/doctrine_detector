  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive explanation of the distinction between the Son of God and human sons, emphasizing Jesus' eternal existence and divine nature within the Trinity. They accurately explain that human sons are created beings while Jesus has always existed as part of the triune Godhead. The student also supports their answer with references to the Gospel of John to showcase Jesus' preexistence and divine attributes.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could have been improved by directly stating that the Son of God was active in the creation of the world, as specified in the reference answer. This key point is missing from the student's response, hence the slight deduction in the grade.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept but could benefit from explicitly addressing all aspects outlined in the reference answer for a more complete response."
