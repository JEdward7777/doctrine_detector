## [Answer](../Eternal_Nature_of_the_Son.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Son of God" is used in the Bible to refer to Jesus Christ, who is described as the unique and only begotten Son of God. While human sons are created beings who come into existence through biological birth, Jesus as the Son of God has always existed as a divine being within the Trinity.

Jesus, being the Son of God, shares the same divine nature and essence with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. He is eternal and has existed from eternity past. In the Gospel of John, it is emphasized that Jesus preexisted before his incarnation on earth (John 1:1-3) and that he has divine attributes such as being the Creator of all things.

Therefore, the distinction between the Son of God and human sons lies in their nature of existence. Human sons are finite, created beings, while the Son of God is eternal, existing from eternity past as part of the triune Godhead. This unique status of Jesus as the Son of God highlights his divine identity, showing that he is not simply a human being but the incarnate Son of God who came to earth to save humanity.
