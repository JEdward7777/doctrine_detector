## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice in several ways according to Christian theology. Firstly, it demonstrates God's holiness and righteous judgment upon sin. In the Bible, sin is portrayed as rebellion against God's perfect and holy nature, deserving of punishment. The consequences of sin are serious and eternal separation from God is the ultimate punishment for those who reject His offer of salvation.

Secondly, the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects the idea of retributive justice - the principle that individuals should receive punishment that is proportional to their wrongdoing. Those who have willfully rejected God's love and salvation throughout their earthly lives will face the just consequences of their actions in eternity.

Lastly, the existence of hell serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the importance of choosing to follow God's will. It underscores the reality of moral choices and the eternal consequences that accompany them. Ultimately, the concept of eternal punishment in hell is a manifestation of God's perfect justice and the necessity for righteousness in His kingdom.
