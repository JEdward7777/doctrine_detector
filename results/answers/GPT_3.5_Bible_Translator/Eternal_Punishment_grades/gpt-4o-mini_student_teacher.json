  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice, drawing upon Christian theology. They have touched on important points such as sin as rebellion against God, retributive justice, and the consequences of rejecting salvation. However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the centrality of belief in Jesus' sacrifice as the key determining factor for eternal punishment in hell, as highlighted in the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and integrated relevant Christian principles in their response."
