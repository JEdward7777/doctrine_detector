  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a strong explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice in responding to rebellion and rejection of His salvation plan. The student effectively addresses the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences by highlighting the principles of retributive justice and the seriousness of sin. However, to improve the grade, the response could have delved deeper into how God's mercy also plays a role in the concept of eternal punishment in hell, balancing justice with the opportunity for repentance and salvation."
