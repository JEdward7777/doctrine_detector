  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a strong explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice in responding to rebellion and rejection of His salvation plan. It adequately addresses the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences, emphasizing the importance of God's holiness, righteous judgment, retributive justice, and the seriousness of sin. The only slight critique is that it could have delved even deeper into the tension between justice and mercy in relation to eternal punishment."
