## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Matthew 19:12, Jesus was addressing the topic of marriage and pointing out that not everyone is called to marriage. He mentioned three categories of eunuchs: those who were born that way, those who were made eunuchs by others, and those who chose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. 

In the context of celibacy, Jesus seems to be acknowledging that some individuals may choose to remain celibate in order to better serve and focus on their relationship with God. This choice to live a celibate life can be a way of dedicating oneself fully to God's work and kingdom.

Throughout Christian history, celibacy has been seen as a way for individuals to devote themselves entirely to God's service, whether through ministry, mission work, or other forms of service. It is a voluntary choice that some make in order to live a life of greater spiritual focus and dedication.

Ultimately, the decision to live a celibate life is a personal one, and it is important for individuals to prayerfully discern God's will for their lives in this regard.
