The explanation is clear and aligned with Christian teachings on celibacy as a voluntary choice to dedicate oneself fully to God's service. However, there could be more emphasis on the importance of celibacy within specific Christian traditions, such as in the Catholic Church where celibacy is required for priests. Additionally, tying in scriptural support or historical examples of celibacy in Christian practice could further enhance the answer."
