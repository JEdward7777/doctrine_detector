  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 and made a good connection to the concept of celibacy. They effectively highlighted the three categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus and explained how celibacy can be a way of dedicating oneself to God's work. The student could have strengthened their response by incorporating more direct references to the biblical perspective on celibacy and providing specific examples from Christian history. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful answer."
