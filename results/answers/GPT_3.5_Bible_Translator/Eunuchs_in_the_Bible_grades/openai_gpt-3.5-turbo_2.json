  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a well-explained understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy as seen through the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 19:12. The explanation is clear, supported by relevant Scripture, and reflects a Christian worldview on celibacy as a choice for dedication to God's service. The response could further strengthen its argument by referencing additional biblical passages or theological perspectives on celibacy."
