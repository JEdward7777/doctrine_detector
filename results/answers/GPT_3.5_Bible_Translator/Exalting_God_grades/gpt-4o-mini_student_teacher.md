90.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 90.

While the student's answer excellently articulates the concept of exalting God in daily life and provides practical examples of how to do so, they have gone beyond the reference answer provided by the teacher. From a Christian worldview, the student's comprehensive understanding and application of exalting God in daily life are commendable. However, the concern was specifically about understanding the importance of exalting God above all else, which could have been emphasized more explicitly in the student's response. Overall, the student's answer is robust, aligned with Christian principles, and demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept.
