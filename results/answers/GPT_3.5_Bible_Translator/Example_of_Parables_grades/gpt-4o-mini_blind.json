The student effectively captures the essence of the parable and its significance in challenging societal norms and cultural prejudices. However, there is room for improvement in terms of expanding on the spiritual implications of the parable and relating it to the broader teachings of Jesus regarding love, mercy, and redemption. Additionally, incorporating biblical references or theological insights could enhance the depth of the analysis."
