# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One of the most well-known parables told by Jesus is the Parable of the Good Samaritan found in the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37. In this parable, Jesus tells the story of a man who is beaten, robbed, and left on the side of the road. A priest and a Levite, who were religious leaders, both pass by the injured man without helping him. However, a Samaritan, who was considered an outcast by the Jews, stops to help the man. 

This parable is significant because it challenges the listeners to think about who their neighbor truly is and what it means to love your neighbor as yourself. It teaches us that love and compassion should transcend social and cultural boundaries, and that true neighborly love is shown through tangible acts of kindness and mercy towards those in need. Jesus is illustrating the importance of not just talking about love, but actually demonstrating it through our actions.
