## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Yes, of course. In the Bible, there are several instances where individuals are described as being demon-possessed. Here are a few examples:

1. In the Gospel of Matthew (8:28-34), we read about two demon-possessed men who lived in the region of the Gadarenes. These men were so violent that no one could pass by that way. Jesus eventually encounters them, casts out the demons, and sends them into a herd of pigs that then rush into the sea and drown.

2. In Mark 5:1-20, we find the story of a man with an unclean spirit who lived among the tombs and could not be restrained even with chains. Jesus encounters this man and casts out the legion of demons that had possessed him, causing them to enter a herd of pigs that then run into the sea and drown.

3. In Luke 8:26-39, we read a similar account of a demon-possessed man living in the region of the Gerasenes. Jesus delivers the man from the demons, sending them into a nearby herd of pigs that also rush into the sea and drown.

These examples demonstrate the power of Jesus over demons and his ability to set individuals free from demonic possession. It is important to note that these accounts serve to illustrate the reality of spiritual warfare and the authority of Jesus over all evil forces.
