  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided comprehensive examples of demon possession from the Bible, highlighting key accounts where Jesus intervenes and demonstrates His authority over demons. The inclusion of detailed narratives from Matthew, Mark, and Luke shows a good understanding of the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative. However, the student could have further strengthened their answer by referencing additional instances of demon possession to provide a more comprehensive view of this theme in the Bible."
