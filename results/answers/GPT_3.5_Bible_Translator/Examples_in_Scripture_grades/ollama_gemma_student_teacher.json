  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical accounts of demon possession and their relevance to contemporary faith. The examples provided are accurate and well-supported by textual references. Additionally, the student appropriately highlights the power of Jesus over demons and the significance of spiritual warfare. However, including the teacher's reference answer would have strengthened the response by providing more specific citations and expanding on the prevalence of spiritual issues in the biblical narrative."
