The examples given effectively show how individuals possessed by demons encountered Jesus and were set free. The response also highlights the relevance of these accounts to contemporary faith by emphasizing the power of Jesus over evil forces and spiritual warfare. This analysis is thorough and aligns well with a Christian worldview perspective."
