## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
There are several examples in the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt:

1. Adam and Eve - In the book of Genesis, Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. After they ate the fruit, they felt guilt and shame for their disobedience.

2. King David - In 2 Samuel 11, King David committed adultery with Bathsheba and arranged for her husband Uriah to be killed in battle. When confronted by the prophet Nathan, David felt guilt and repented of his sin.

3. Judas Iscariot - Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver, leading to Jesus' crucifixion. After realizing the consequences of his actions, Judas felt overwhelming guilt and ultimately took his own life.

4. Peter's Denial - In the Gospel accounts, Peter denied Jesus three times before his crucifixion, despite previously proclaiming his loyalty to Jesus. After realizing his betrayal, Peter wept bitterly and felt deep guilt for his actions.

These examples illustrate how guilt can result from disobedience, betrayal, or failure to live according to God's commands. They also show the importance of acknowledging guilt, repenting of sins, and seeking forgiveness and reconciliation with God.
