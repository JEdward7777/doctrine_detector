  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and relevant explanation citing various biblical examples demonstrating the concept of guilt. However, the student could improve their answer by incorporating the reference answer provided by the teacher, which highlights specific instances that directly address the concern of divine judgment and innocence in the context of guilt. By including this additional example, the student's response would align more closely with the specified concern and provide a more comprehensive understanding of guilt in a Christian worldview."
