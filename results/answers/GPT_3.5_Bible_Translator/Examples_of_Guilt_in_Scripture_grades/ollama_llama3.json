  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response provides some biblical examples that demonstrate guilt, it does not directly address the concern of how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment. The provided examples from Adam and Eve, King David, Judas Iscariot, and Peter's denial primarily illustrate the emotional and psychological effects of guilt, rather than its relationship to divine justice.\n\nThe only mention of divine judgment is a passing reference in the concluding sentence, which does not adequately address the concern specified. Additionally, the examples provided do not directly relate to Pilate declaring Jesus innocent or the robber acknowledging their own guilt compared to Jesus, which are mentioned in the answer as alternative examples.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more explicit connections between the biblical examples and the concern about how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment."
