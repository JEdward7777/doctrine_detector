  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response exceeds the minimum requirement by providing specific examples of Jesus' miracles, including their significance and implications for our understanding of His divinity. The writer effectively shows how each miracle demonstrates Jesus' power over the natural world, his authority to forgive sins, and his care for humanity. Additionally, the response acknowledges the transformative impact of Jesus' miracles on those who witnessed them.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because this response does not fully address the concern about recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in our belief in Him as the Son of God. While the writer mentions that each miracle underscores Jesus' identity as the Son of God and Savior of the world, they could have more explicitly explored how these miracles specifically contribute to our faith in Jesus.\n\nOverall, this response is well-structured and provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance of Jesus' miracles. With some additional development on the connection between the miracles and our belief in Jesus as the Son of God, it could be even stronger."
