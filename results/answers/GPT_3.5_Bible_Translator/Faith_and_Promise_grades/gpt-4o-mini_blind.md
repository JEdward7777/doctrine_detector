## [Answer](../Faith_and_Promise.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the example of Abram (later known as Abraham) in the Bible, faith played a crucial role in receiving and trusting the promises of God. In Genesis 15:6, it is written, "And he [Abram] believed the Lord, and He [the Lord] credited it to him as righteousness."

Abram's faith was demonstrated by his belief in God's promise that he would have a son and become the father of many nations, despite his old age and the apparent impossibility of the situation. This faith was not just a mental assent to a set of facts but a deep trust in the character and faithfulness of God.

Similarly, in the New Testament, the apostle Paul writes in Romans 4:20-21 about Abraham's unwavering faith: "Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised."

Faith, then, is essential in receiving and trusting the promises of God because it acknowledges God's sovereignty, power, and faithfulness. It involves belief in who God is and what He has promised, even when circumstances seem impossible or when doubts arise. This kind of faith is pleasing to God and is the foundation of a right relationship with Him.
