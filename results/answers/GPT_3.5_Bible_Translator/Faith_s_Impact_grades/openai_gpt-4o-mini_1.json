The reference to specific ways in which faith in Jesus is evidenced in daily life, such as repentance, fruits of the Spirit, good works, relationship with God, perseverance, and transformation, demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept. The connection to scripture (Galatians 5:22-23) also strengthens the response from a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is the lack of explicit mention of the Holy Spirit in the response, which would have further emphasized the role of the Spirit in producing these evidences of true faith."
