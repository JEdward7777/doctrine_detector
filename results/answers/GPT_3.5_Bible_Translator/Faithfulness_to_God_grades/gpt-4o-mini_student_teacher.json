  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of faithfulness to God in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the importance of trust, obedience, and aligning one's life with God's will. The student effectively references relevant biblical passages to support their explanation. However, the student could have directly addressed the concern by focusing more explicitly on the idea of loyalty and perseverance in their definition of faithfulness, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
