They correctly highlight that favoritism goes against the Biblical principle of treating others with love, fairness, and equality. The answer reflects a good understanding of how favoritism can lead to negative consequences such as resentment, jealousy, and division. The student effectively ties in the importance of demonstrating Christ-like love and humility in all interactions. Minor improvements could include incorporating specific Biblical references or examples to further strengthen the response."
