It affirms the idea that receiving God's grace signifies his favor and mercy towards individuals. However, the concern regarding how one can seek and recognize God's favor in their life is not directly addressed in the response. Expanding on practical steps or attitudes that individuals can adopt to seek and recognize God's favor would enhance the completeness of the answer."
