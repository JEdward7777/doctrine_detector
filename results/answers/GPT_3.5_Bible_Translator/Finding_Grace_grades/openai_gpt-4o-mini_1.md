## [Answer](../Finding_Grace.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Finding grace in the eyes of God means to receive favor and kindness from God that is not earned or deserved. In the Bible, we see examples of individuals who found grace in God's eyes, such as Noah in Genesis 6:8. This means that God chose to show mercy and favor to Noah, despite the prevailing wickedness in the world at that time. Finding grace in the eyes of God ultimately speaks to God's loving and merciful nature, as he freely bestows his grace on those whom he chooses.
