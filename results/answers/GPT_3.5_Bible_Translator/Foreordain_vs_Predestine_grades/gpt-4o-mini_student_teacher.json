  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 80. They provided a clear and accurate explanation of the concepts of \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" in Christian teachings, emphasizing the differences in connotations between the two terms. The student effectively described how \"foreordain\" relates to God's broader plan or purpose, while \"predestine\" specifically relates to individual salvation. The only area where the student's response differs slightly from the reference answer is in the emphasis placed on God's authority in the plan. The student could have made this point more explicitly to align perfectly with the teacher's response. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the theological concepts in question."
