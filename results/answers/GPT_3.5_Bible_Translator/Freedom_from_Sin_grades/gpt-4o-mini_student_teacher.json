The student also provides solid biblical references, such as 1 John 1:9 and John 8:36, to support their explanation of finding freedom through confession, seeking God's help, and ultimately through the saving work of Jesus Christ. The response aligns well with the concern of encouraging believers to address sin for a deeper relationship with God, and the suggested actions are in line with a Christian worldview. Well done!"
