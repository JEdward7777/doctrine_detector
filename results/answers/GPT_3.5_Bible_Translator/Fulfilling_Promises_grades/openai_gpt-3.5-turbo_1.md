# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Fulfilling promises or vows made before God is considered of utmost importance in the Christian perspective. When someone makes a promise or vow before God, it is taken very seriously as a commitment to honor God and uphold their word. 

In the Bible, Ecclesiastes 5:4-5 says, "When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it." This passage emphasizes the importance of keeping one's word to God.

Jesus also addresses the importance of integrity and honesty in Matthew 5:33-37, where He teaches about the seriousness of oaths and vows. He instructs His followers to let their yes be yes and their no be no, without the need for elaborate oaths, emphasizing the need for truthfulness and reliability.

In summary, fulfilling promises or vows made before God is crucial in the Christian faith as it reflects a person's commitment to honoring God, displaying integrity, and keeping their word. God values honesty, integrity, and faithfulness, and Christians are called to uphold these values in all aspects of their lives, including fulfilling promises made before Him.
