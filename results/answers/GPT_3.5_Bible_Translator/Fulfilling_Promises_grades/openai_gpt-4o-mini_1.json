It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of keeping one's word not only as a reflection of integrity but also as an act of obedience to God, highlighting the impact of failing to do so on one's faith. The integration of scriptural references and the emphasis on honesty and commitment to God's values strengthen the overall argument."
