When a prophecy is said to be fulfilled according to Biblical teaching, it means that an event or outcome has occurred as foretold by a prophet in the Bible. Prophecies in the Bible are messages from God that are conveyed through individuals known as prophets. These prophecies often predict future events, reveal God's will, or call people to repentance.

The fulfillment of a prophecy is significant because it demonstrates God's sovereignty, faithfulness, and the reliability of His Word. When a prophecy is fulfilled, it confirms the divine inspiration of the Bible and reinforces the belief that God is actively involved in human history.

Throughout the Bible, there are numerous prophecies that have been fulfilled, such as the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The fulfillment of these prophecies serves as evidence of Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan for humanity.

Ultimately, the fulfillment of prophecies in the Bible points to the trustworthiness of God's Word and reinforces the importance of faith in God's promises.
