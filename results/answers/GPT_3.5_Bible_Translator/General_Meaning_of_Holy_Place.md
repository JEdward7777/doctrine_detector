## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, the concept of a "holy place" can extend beyond physical structures like the tabernacle or temple to include the spiritual dwelling place of God within believers. The Bible teaches that God no longer dwells in temples made by human hands (Acts 7:48), but rather, believers are now temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). This means that wherever believers gather in the name of Jesus, God's presence is there among them (Matthew 18:20).

Furthermore, the New Testament emphasizes that believers are a "holy priesthood" and a "royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:5, 9), indicating that every believer has direct access to God and can serve Him in a priestly manner. This means that wherever a believer goes, they carry the presence of God with them and can serve as a holy place where God is worshiped and glorified.

In this broader context, a holy place is not limited to a physical location but can be found wherever believers gather to worship, pray, serve, and live out their faith in obedience to God. The emphasis is on the indwelling presence of God in the hearts of believers and the corporate unity of the body of Christ as the temple of the Holy Spirit.
