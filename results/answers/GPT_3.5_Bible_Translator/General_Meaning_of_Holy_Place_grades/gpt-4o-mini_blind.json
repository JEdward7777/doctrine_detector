  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a solid Christian perspective on the concept of a \"holy place\" extending beyond physical structures like the tabernacle or temple. It effectively references biblical passages such as Acts 7:48, 1 Corinthians 6:19, Matthew 18:20, and 1 Peter 2:5, 9 to support the idea of believers being temples of the Holy Spirit and a holy priesthood. The response clearly articulates the New Testament teaching on believers carrying the presence of God with them and serving as holy places where God is worshiped. Overall, a well-thought-out and doctrinally sound explanation."
