  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-developed and insightful perspective on the concept of a \"holy place\" in a broader context beyond physical structures. They effectively connect Christian theology and scripture to explain how believers themselves can be considered holy places where God's presence resides. The response could be enhanced by further integrating the idea of dedicated spiritual significance and divine encounter in the everyday lives of believers to align more closely with the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a strong and reflective theological perspective presented."
