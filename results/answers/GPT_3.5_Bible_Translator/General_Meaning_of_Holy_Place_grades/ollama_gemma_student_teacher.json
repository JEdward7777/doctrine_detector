The student correctly identifies that the concept extends beyond physical structures to include the spiritual dwelling place of God within believers. Additionally, the student provides relevant biblical references to support their claims. The emphasis on the indwelling presence of God in the hearts of believers and the corporate unity of the body of Christ as the temple of the Holy Spirit is particularly insightful. Overall, this is a well-written and well-researched response that thoughtfully explores the broader context of a \"holy place.\""
