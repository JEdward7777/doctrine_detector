  "grade": 92.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 92.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the spiritual gifts related to evangelism, highlighting the unique role that evangelists play in sharing the gospel with others. The description of an evangelist's passion for spreading the message and their commitment to reaching those who have not yet heard the gospel is particularly strong.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response could be more detailed in its explanation of the distinguishing factors between evangelists and other Christians. While it mentions that all Christians are called to share their faith, the response could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of how evangelists' gifts and passions set them apart from others.\n\nOverall, though, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides a clear understanding of what an evangelist is and does."
