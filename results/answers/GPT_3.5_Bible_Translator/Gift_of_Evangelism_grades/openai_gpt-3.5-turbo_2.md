## [Answer](../Gift_of_Evangelism.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
An evangelist is someone who has a specific calling to share the good news of Jesus Christ with others, with the intention of leading them to faith in Jesus. While all Christians are called to share their faith and make disciples, an evangelist is often uniquely gifted and passionate about spreading the gospel. They may have a special ability to communicate effectively and boldly proclaim the message of salvation. Additionally, evangelists may have a strong sense of urgency and commitment to reaching those who have not yet heard the gospel. Ultimately, the distinguishing factor of an evangelist is their particular focus on evangelism and their dedication to bringing others to faith in Christ.
