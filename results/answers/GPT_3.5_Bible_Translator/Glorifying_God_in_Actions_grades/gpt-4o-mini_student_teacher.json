  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and comprehensive list of ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily life, which align well with a Christian worldview. However, the focus on specific actions and principles, while important, may have slightly missed the heart of the concern to emphasize the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness. The teacher's reference answer highlights the importance of sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments to reflect His glory to others, which is a crucial aspect of actively glorifying God. The student's answer is strong, but could benefit from a bit more emphasis on reflecting God's character and sharing personal testimonies in daily life."
