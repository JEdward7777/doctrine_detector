2. Obeying God's commandments and living a life that reflects His holiness (1 Peter 1:15-16).

4. Sharing the gospel with others and being a witness for Christ in both word and deed (Matthew 28:19-20).
5. Using their gifts and talents for the benefit of the church and the kingdom of God (1 Peter 4:10-11).
6. Seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness in all areas of life (Matthew 6:33).
7. Responding to trials and difficulties with faith and trust in God's sovereignty and goodness (James 1:2-4).
8. Being a light in the world by demonstrating the fruits of the Spirit - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23).
9. Walking in humility and dependence on God, acknowledging that apart from Him, we can do nothing (John 15:5).

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thorough and comprehensive list of ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily life, which align well with a Christian worldview. However, the focus on specific actions and principles, while important, may have slightly missed the heart of the concern to emphasize the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness. The teacher's reference answer highlights the importance of sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments to reflect His glory to others, which is a crucial aspect of actively glorifying God. The student's answer is strong, but could benefit from a bit more emphasis on reflecting God's character and sharing personal testimonies in daily life.
