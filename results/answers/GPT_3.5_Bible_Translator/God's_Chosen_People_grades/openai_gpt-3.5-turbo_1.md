# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of a remnant in the Bible refers to a small group of people who remain faithful to God despite widespread unfaithfulness among the larger community. This idea underscores God's selective grace because it emphasizes that God chooses, preserves, and blesses those who are faithful to Him.

Throughout the Old Testament, we see examples of God preserving a remnant of His people even in times of judgment and exile. For instance, in the book of Isaiah, the prophet speaks about a faithful remnant that God will preserve and bring back to Himself. This demonstrates God's selective grace in choosing to show mercy and favor to those who remain faithful to Him.

In the New Testament, the apostle Paul also refers to the idea of a remnant in the context of God's chosen people. He explains that God has not rejected His people completely but has always preserved a remnant who are chosen by grace. This emphasizes that God's grace is not based on human merit or works but on His sovereign choice and mercy.

Overall, the concept of a remnant highlights God's selective grace towards His people by showing that He chooses and preserves those who remain faithful to Him, even in times of judgment and adversity.
