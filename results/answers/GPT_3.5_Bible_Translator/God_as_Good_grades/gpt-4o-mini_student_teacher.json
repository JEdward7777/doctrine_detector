  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student accurately captures the essence of Jesus' statement by emphasizing the perfect goodness and holiness of God as the ultimate source of goodness. They explained the context in which the statement was made and how it challenges our understanding of goodness and righteousness. The student also correctly identifies that as Christians, we believe in God as the epitome of goodness and the standard of what is truly good and righteous.\n\nThe student's answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The only slight improvement could be to explicitly mention that Jesus was pointing to God as the ultimate standard of goodness, in line with the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on goodness in relation to God."
