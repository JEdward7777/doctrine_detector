## Question [God as Good](../../../questions/God_as_Good.md)
What does Jesus mean when he states, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God'?

## Correct Answer
This statement emphasizes the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.

## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
When Jesus made the statement, "There is only one who is good, and that is God," he was emphasizing the perfect goodness and holiness of God. This statement can be found in the Gospel of Matthew 19:17, when a rich young ruler addressed Jesus as "good teacher" and asked him what he needed to do to inherit eternal life.

In this interaction, Jesus was challenging the man's understanding of goodness and righteousness. By pointing to God as the only true source of goodness, Jesus was ultimately highlighting the fact that all goodness originates from God alone. As Christians, we believe that God is the epitome of goodness, and He alone sets the standard for what is truly good and righteous. This statement serves as a reminder to us that true goodness can only be found in God, and we are called to strive to reflect His goodness in our own lives.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 90.

The student accurately captures the essence of Jesus' statement by emphasizing the perfect goodness and holiness of God as the ultimate source of goodness. They explained the context in which the statement was made and how it challenges our understanding of goodness and righteousness. The student also correctly identifies that as Christians, we believe in God as the epitome of goodness and the standard of what is truly good and righteous.

The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The only slight improvement could be to explicitly mention that Jesus was pointing to God as the ultimate standard of goodness, in line with the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.

Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on goodness in relation to God.
