Recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.

## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
When Jesus made the statement, "There is only one who is good, and that is God," he was emphasizing the perfect goodness and holiness of God. This statement can be found in the Gospel of Matthew 19:17, when a rich young ruler addressed Jesus as "good teacher" and asked him what he needed to do to inherit eternal life.

In this interaction, Jesus was challenging the man's understanding of goodness and righteousness. By pointing to God as the only true source of goodness, Jesus was ultimately highlighting the fact that all goodness originates from God alone. As Christians, we believe that God is the epitome of goodness, and He alone sets the standard for what is truly good and righteous. This statement serves as a reminder to us that true goodness can only be found in God, and we are called to strive to reflect His goodness in our own lives.

It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of recognizing God as the true source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. The only possible improvement would be to perhaps provide a tangible example or application of how Christians can practically reflect God's goodness in their lives.
