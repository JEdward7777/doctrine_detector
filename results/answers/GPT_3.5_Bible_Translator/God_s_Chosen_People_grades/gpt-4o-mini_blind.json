They accurately conveyed how the idea of a remnant emphasizes God's selective grace towards His people by highlighting His choice, preservation, and blessings for those who remain faithful. The inclusion of both Old Testament and New Testament references strengthened their argument and demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Great job overall!"
