  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and insightful answer that effectively connects the concept of a remnant to God's selective grace. The response demonstrated a solid understanding of how the remnant signifies God's choice and favor towards those who remain faithful. The student effectively referenced both the Old and New Testaments to support their argument. However, the student could have further emphasized the aspect of God's sovereignty in choosing the remnant and tied it more explicitly to recognizing the significance of being chosen by God as indicated in the given concern."
