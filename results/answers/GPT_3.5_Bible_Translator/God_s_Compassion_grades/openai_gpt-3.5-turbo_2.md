## [Answer](../God_s_Compassion.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that God is intrinsically compassionate. Compassion is one of the core attributes of God's nature, and it is consistently presented throughout the Old and New Testaments. 

For example, in the book of Exodus, God reveals His compassionate nature to Moses on Mount Sinai, stating, "The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness" (Exodus 34:6). This verse highlights God's compassion as a fundamental aspect of His character.

Jesus, as the embodiment of God in human form, also exemplified God's compassion in His earthly ministry. In the Gospels, we see Jesus showing compassion to the sick, the marginalized, and the sinners, demonstrating God's love and mercy towards all people.

In the New Testament, we also read passages that emphasize God's compassionate nature, such as in 2 Corinthians 1:3-4, where it states, "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God."

Overall, the Bible affirms that God is compassionate, loving, merciful, and full of grace towards His creation. His compassion is a central aspect of His character, providing hope and comfort to all who seek Him.
