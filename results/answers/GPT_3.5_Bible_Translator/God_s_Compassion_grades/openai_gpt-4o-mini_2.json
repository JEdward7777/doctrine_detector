The integration of Old and New Testament examples, including the attributes of God shown in Exodus and the compassionate actions of Jesus in the Gospels, effectively highlights the relationship between God's compassion, love, and mercy. Additionally, linking God's compassion to our own actions towards others based on 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 demonstrates a holistic understanding of the concept. Overall, the response is well-supported and insightfully connects God's compassion to divine love and mercy."
