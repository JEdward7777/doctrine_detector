  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively explains the significance of God's calling in relation to intentionality and purpose, drawing on relevant biblical verses to support their points. They demonstrate a strong understanding of how God's intentional interactions with humanity play a role in His divine plan. The student's response aligns well with the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern raised. The grade is slightly lower than perfect as the student could have further connected the biblical verses to the specific implication of intentionality in God's calling."
