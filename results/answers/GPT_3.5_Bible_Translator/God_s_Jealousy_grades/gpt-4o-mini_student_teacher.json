  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. The student provided a well-thought-out and accurate explanation of God's jealousy as described in the Bible, emphasizing the righteous and exclusive desire for love, worship, and loyalty. They correctly distinguished God's jealousy from human jealousy and highlighted how God's jealousy is rooted in His perfect love and desire for our best. The student's answer aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer, demonstrating a clear understanding of God's character and His desire for spiritual fidelity. Great job!"
