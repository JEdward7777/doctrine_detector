  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of how God justifies sinners through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and what justification entails according to Christian theology. The answer correctly emphasizes the role of faith in Jesus Christ as the key to justification, as well as the forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and the promise of eternal life. Well done!"
