## Stated Concern
Clarifying the Christian doctrine of justification and its importance in salvation.

## [Answer](../God_s_Justification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
God justifies sinners through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. Justification is a legal term used in the Bible that refers to God declaring a sinner righteous before Him. This is possible because Jesus Christ took upon Himself the punishment for our sins, so that through faith in Him, we are credited with His righteousness.

When a sinner believes in Jesus Christ and accepts Him as Lord and Savior, that person is justified by faith. This means that God no longer sees the believer's sins, but instead sees the righteousness of Jesus covering them. Justification entails the forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and the promise of eternal life in His presence. It is a key aspect of salvation in Christian theology.
