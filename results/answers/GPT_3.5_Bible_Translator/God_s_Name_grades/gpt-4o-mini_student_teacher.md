## [Answer](../God_s_Name.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The name "Yahweh" is the most sacred and significant name for God in the Bible. It is revealed to Moses in the book of Exodus when God appears to him in the burning bush and instructs him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. When Moses asks God for His name so he can tell the Israelites who sent him, God responds, "I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I am has sent me to you'" (Exodus 3:14).

The name "Yahweh" signifies the self-existent, eternal, and unchanging nature of God. It is a reminder that God is the one who always was, always is, and always will be. The Hebrew verb "to be," from which Yahweh is derived, indicates the essence of God's character as the eternal and living God. This name emphasizes God's sovereignty, faithfulness, and covenant relationship with His people.

In Jewish tradition, the name "Yahweh" is so holy that it is not pronounced out loud. Instead, "Adonai," meaning Lord, is used as a substitute when reading the Scriptures. This reverence for God's name highlights the sacredness and importance of His identity to the Jewish people.

As Christians, we also understand the significance of the name Yahweh as we believe in the triune nature of God - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, declared Himself to be one with the Father, using the divine name "I am" in statements such as "I am the bread of life" and "I am the light of the world" (John 6:35; 8:12). Through Jesus, we have a personal relationship with Yahweh, our eternal and unchanging God, who loves us and keeps His promises.
