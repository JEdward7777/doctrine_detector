  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer highlighting the significance of God's promises in the context of His relationship with His people throughout the Bible. They effectively connected examples from both the Old and New Testaments to emphasize how God's promises demonstrate His faithfulness, love, and sovereignty. The student also discussed how these promises offer hope and assurance to believers. However, the student could have further strengthened their response by directly referencing specific examples like Noah, Abram, and David to align more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
