The student effectively incorporates key Christian principles such as prayer, studying the Bible, seeking counsel, and being attentive to the Holy Spirit's leading. The inclusion of Proverbs 3:5-6 adds further support to the guidance provided. The emphasis on God's sovereignty, trust in His wisdom, and alignment with His will reflects a mature understanding of seeking God's plan. Great job overall!"
