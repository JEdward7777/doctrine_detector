  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling, offering practical and biblical guidance for discerning God's plan. The response accurately incorporates key elements such as prayer, Bible study, seeking wise counsel, and being sensitive to the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are in providing more depth and clarity on certain points. For instance, while the response mentions trusting in God's sovereignty and perfect timing, it would be helpful to elaborate further on what this means practically for believers who may be struggling with uncertainty.\n\nAdditionally, the response could benefit from a stronger connection between its various points. While each statement is individually true and biblical, they don't always flow logically together. A clearer structure or transitions between sentences would make the response feel more cohesive and engaging.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern of spiritual uncertainty and provides helpful guidance for believers seeking to discern God's plan."
