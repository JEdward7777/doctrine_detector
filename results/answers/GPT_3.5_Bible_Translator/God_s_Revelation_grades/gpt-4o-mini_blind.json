  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a well-written and informative response that correctly identifies and explains important names by which God introduces Himself in the Bible. The student effectively highlights the significance of each name in revealing different aspects of God's character and nature. The response could be further strengthened by including a brief mention of the name \"Jehovah-Jireh\" (The Lord Will Provide) to provide a more comprehensive overview of God's self-revelation through His names."
