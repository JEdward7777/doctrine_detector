  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer by discussing various names of God and their significance in revealing different aspects of His character. However, the concern of recognizing the importance of God's revelation in understanding His character and relationship with His followers could have been addressed more directly by focusing on how each name deepens the understanding of God's relationship with His people. The student's response is informative and well-written but could have been strengthened by a more explicit connection to the importance of God's revelation in shaping the relationship between God and His followers."
