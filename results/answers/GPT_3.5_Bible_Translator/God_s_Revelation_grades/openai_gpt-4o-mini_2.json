  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 95. The student provides a comprehensive explanation of various names of God in the Bible and their significance in revealing aspects of His character and nature. The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of how God reveals Himself through His names and the importance of this revelation in understanding His relationship with His followers. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to provide additional Biblical references to support the points made."
