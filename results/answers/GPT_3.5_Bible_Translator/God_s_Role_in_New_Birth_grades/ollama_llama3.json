  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response accurately emphasizes God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation, highlighting that new birth is not achieved through human effort but by divine initiative. The Scripture references provided from John 6:44, John 3:3, Ephesians 2:8-9 also support this understanding. The language used is clear and concise, and the explanation is well-organized.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to further develop the idea that God's role in the process of a person being born again includes not just divine initiative but also divine love and sovereignty. While the response mentions \"divine grace\" and \"love\", it could delve deeper into what this means practically and how it relates to the believer's experience.\n\nOverall, however, the response effectively addresses the concern about recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in salvation, and provides a clear and biblically-based explanation of the process of being born again."
