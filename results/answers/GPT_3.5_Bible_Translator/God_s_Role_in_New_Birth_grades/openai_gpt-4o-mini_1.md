## [Answer](../God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the process of a person being born again, God plays a central and essential role. According to Christian beliefs, it is God who initiates the process of spiritual rebirth in an individual by drawing them to Himself through the work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus himself said in John 6:44, "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them." This drawing involves conviction of sin, repentance, and a turning towards God.

Furthermore, in John 3:3, Jesus tells Nicodemus, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." This new birth is not something that can be achieved through human effort or willpower but is a supernatural work of God in the heart of a believer.

It is important to recognize that while God is the initiator of the new birth, He also requires a response from individuals to accept the gift of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. As it says in Ephesians 2:8-9, "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast." Thus, God's role in the process of a person being born again is one of divine grace, love, and sovereignty, working in conjunction with the individual's faith and response to His call.
