It effectively highlights God's sovereignty, the examples from the Bible, and the importance of trusting in His timing. The answer could have been strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references to support the points made and by emphasizing the significance of obedience and submission to God's timing. Overall, a good response but could have been enhanced with deeper biblical integration."
