  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 90. The student provides a comprehensive explanation of how God's punishment is described during the 'day of Yahweh', citing examples from the biblical books of Zephaniah and Joel. They effectively convey the concept of judgment, wrath, and consequences for disbelief in a clear and detailed manner from a Christian perspective. The information aligns well with the concern provided and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. The response could have been slightly improved by referencing the specific term 'pouring out of God\u2019s wrath' as outlined in the reference answer, but overall, the student's answer is well-supported and demonstrates a good grasp of the subject matter."
