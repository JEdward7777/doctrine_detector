It effectively addresses the concern by discussing the nature of God's judgment as a pouring out of His wrath on those who do not believe. The connection between the answer and the concern is clear, and the response aligns well with a Christian worldview, underscoring the consequences of disbelief and the necessity of living in obedience to God."
