The term "zeal of the Lord" is used in the Bible to describe God's passion, fervor, and intense commitment towards His people and His purposes. It reflects God's righteous anger towards sin and injustice, as well as His love and desire for the salvation and well-being of His people.

In the Old Testament, the concept of the zeal of the Lord is often associated with God's judgment on disobedient or idolatrous people. For example, in the book of Isaiah, the prophet speaks of God's zeal for His people's righteousness and His judgment on those who rebel against Him (Isaiah 9:7, 37:32).

On the other hand, the zeal of the Lord is also seen as a manifestation of God's love and care for His people. In the New Testament, the apostle Paul describes God's zeal for His people as a demonstration of His grace and mercy towards sinners (Romans 10:1-3).

Overall, the term "zeal of the Lord" reflects God's intense passion and commitment towards His people, both in judgment and in love, showing that God's actions are always motivated by His perfect and righteous character.
