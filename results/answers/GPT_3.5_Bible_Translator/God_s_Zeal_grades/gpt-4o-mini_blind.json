  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid explanation of the term \"zeal of the Lord\" and its implications for God's actions towards His people, incorporating references from both the Old and New Testaments. The answer correctly identifies God's passion, fervor, and commitment, as well as His righteous anger towards sin and His love for His people. Additionally, the student appropriately discusses the dual nature of God's zeal in judgment and love. However, to improve the response, the student could further emphasize the aspect of God's zeal as a reflection of His holiness and faithfulness to His covenant with His people. Incorporating more Scriptures that specifically highlight these aspects would enhance the theological depth of the explanation."
