  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"zeal of the Lord\" by covering both aspects of God's passion towards His people, including judgment and love. The answer effectively captures the complexity of God's zeal reflected in both Old and New Testament contexts. While the student's response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, it slightly deviates from the given reference answer that focuses more on God's efforts to bless His people and ensure justice. Nonetheless, the student's insights align well with a Christian worldview and offer a deeper understanding of God's character and actions through His zeal."
