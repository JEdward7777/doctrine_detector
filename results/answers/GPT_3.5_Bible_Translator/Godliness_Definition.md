## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible defines godliness as a lifestyle and character that reflects the character and attributes of God. In 1 Timothy 4:7-8, it says, "Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come."

Godliness involves living in a way that honors and glorifies God in all aspects of life. This includes practicing virtues such as love, compassion, patience, kindness, humility, and obedience to God's commands. It also involves seeking to imitate Christ and to be transformed by the Holy Spirit to become more like Him.

Ultimately, godliness is about living a life that is dedicated to God and His will, seeking to reflect His character and bring glory to His name in everything we do.
