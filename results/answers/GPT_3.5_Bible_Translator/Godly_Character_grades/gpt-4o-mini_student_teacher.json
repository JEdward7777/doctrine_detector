  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the fruits of the Holy Spirit and how they indicate godly character. They correctly referenced the Bible verse in Galatians 5:22-23 and explained how exhibiting these traits reflects the nature of God. However, the student included additional traits beyond the reference answer provided by the teacher, which could potentially lead to confusion or deviation from the specific question. Overall, a strong answer but slight deviation from the reference answer warranting a slightly lower grade."
