  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively expands on the concept of Jesus healing demon-possessed individuals by providing a detailed explanation of how Jesus demonstrated his authority over evil spirits. The incorporation of the specific biblical example from the Gospel of Mark further strengthens the answer. The response also highlights important Christian beliefs about the power of Jesus, prayer, faith, and compassion in the context of healing. Well done in addressing the concern within a Christian-specific worldview."
