## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the practice of anointing is often related to healing in a spiritual and symbolic sense. Anointing with oil was a common practice in the ancient world for various purposes, including healing and consecration.

In the New Testament, we see instances where anointing with oil is specifically connected to healing. In the book of James, it is written, "Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven" (James 5:14-15). Here, the anointing with oil is coupled with prayer and faith as a means of seeking healing and restoration.

Anointing with oil symbolizes the presence and work of the Holy Spirit, who is the ultimate healer and comforter. It signifies a consecration and setting apart for God's purposes, and the oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit's empowering and healing presence in the life of the believer.

While anointing with oil can be a physical act, its real power lies in the spiritual significance and the faith behind it. Ultimately, it is God who heals and restores, and the practice of anointing with oil is a way for believers to express their trust in God's healing power and to seek His help in times of sickness and need.
