  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how anointing is related to healing in the New Testament, highlighting the spiritual and symbolic significance of the practice. They effectively referenced the passage from the book of James and connected the anointing with oil to prayer, faith, and the work of the Holy Spirit. The student's answer aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the role of God as the ultimate healer and the importance of faith in seeking healing. The only minor improvement would be to directly relate the anointing with oil practice to seeking God's intervention for healing, as stated in the reference answer."
