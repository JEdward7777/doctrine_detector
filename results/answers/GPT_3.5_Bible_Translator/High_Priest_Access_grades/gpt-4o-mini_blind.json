  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the specific individuals designated by God to approach the ark of the covenant and the consequences of unauthorized approach. The student accurately references relevant biblical passages and provides a clear explanation of the instructions given by God regarding the handling of the ark. The only minor improvement would be to further elaborate on the significance of the ark itself and its representation of God's presence among His people."
