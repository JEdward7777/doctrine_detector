  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of the restrictions and consequences surrounding approaching the ark of the covenant, including the roles of the Levitical priests. However, the specific concern mentioned was the recognition of the high priest and their annual access on the Day of Atonement. The student adequately addresses the role of the high priest but could have focused more on this specific aspect to align closer to the reference answer."
