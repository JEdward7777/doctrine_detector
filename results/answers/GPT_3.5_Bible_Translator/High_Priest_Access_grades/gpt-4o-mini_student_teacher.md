## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, only specific individuals who were designated by God were allowed to approach the ark of the covenant, and even then, there were specific instructions to follow. According to the Old Testament, only the Levitical priests, particularly the high priest, were permitted to approach the ark. 

In Numbers 4:15, God instructed Moses and Aaron to assign the Kohathite branch of the Levites to take care of the ark and the other sacred items in the tabernacle. However, even the Kohathites were not allowed to touch the ark itself, but were to carry it using poles through the rings on its sides. 

In the Book of Exodus, God also gave Moses specific instructions on how the ark was to be handled and transported. For example, in Exodus 25:14-15, it states that the ark was to be carried on the shoulders of the priests using poles, and no one was to touch it directly. 

There are several instances in the Bible where individuals who were not authorized to touch or approach the ark suffered severe consequences. For example, in 2 Samuel 6:6-7, Uzzah reached out to steady the ark when the oxen pulling it stumbled, and he was struck dead by God as a result of his irreverence.

Therefore, approaching the ark of the covenant was a sacred and solemn responsibility reserved for the appointed Levitical priests, and any unauthorized or irreverent approach was met with severe consequences.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of the restrictions and consequences surrounding approaching the ark of the covenant, including the roles of the Levitical priests. However, the specific concern mentioned was the recognition of the high priest and their annual access on the Day of Atonement. The student adequately addresses the role of the high priest but could have focused more on this specific aspect to align closer to the reference answer.
