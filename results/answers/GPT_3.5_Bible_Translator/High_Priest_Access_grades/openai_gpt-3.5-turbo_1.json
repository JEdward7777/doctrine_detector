  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the restrictions and instructions related to approaching the ark of the covenant, highlighting the significance of the high priest in this context. It effectively recognizes the sacred and exclusive role of the high priest in the Israelites' relationship with God and the covenant. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly mention the Day of Atonement as the specific occasion when the high priest approached the ark, as specified in the original answer."
