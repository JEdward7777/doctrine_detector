  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the restrictions and guidelines for approaching the ark of the covenant in the Old Testament, highlighting the exclusivity of access granted only to the high priest on the Day of Atonement. The reference to relevant Bible passages strengthens the argument for the sacredness and significance of the high priest's role in maintaining the covenant between God and the Israelites. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern with a Christian worldview perspective."
