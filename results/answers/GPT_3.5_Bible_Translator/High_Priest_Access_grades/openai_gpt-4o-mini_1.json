The student effectively links the information provided in the answer to the importance of the high priest's role in mediating the relationship between the Israelites and God through the covenant. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on the significance of the high priest within the context of approaching the ark of the covenant. Great job connecting the answer to the concern raised!"
