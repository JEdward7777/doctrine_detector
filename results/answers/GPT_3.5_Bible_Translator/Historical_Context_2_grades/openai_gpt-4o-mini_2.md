## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt because they had to leave in haste and did not have time to let their bread rise. As recorded in the Bible, in the book of Exodus, the Israelites were told to prepare quickly for their journey out of Egypt, and unleavened bread was a practical solution as it could be made quickly without the need for yeast to make the dough rise. 

Additionally, there is symbolic significance to the use of unleavened bread during the Passover season, which commemorates the Israelites' escape from slavery in Egypt. Leaven, or yeast, is often used in the Bible as a symbol of sin and corruption, so eating unleavened bread during this time serves as a reminder of their need to live in a manner free from sin and to rely on God's provision and timing.
