  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the concept of the remnant in a biblical context, with clear examples from the Old Testament and references to Isaiah and Amos. The student effectively connects the concept of the remnant to the idea of a faithful minority within a larger community. However, to improve the grade, the student could have delved deeper into how the concept of the remnant is specifically portrayed in Isaiah and Amos, providing more detailed analysis and insights from those particular texts. Additionally, referencing specific verses in Isaiah and Amos that highlight the remnant theme would have strengthened the answer."
