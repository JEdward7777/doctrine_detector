  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of a remnant in biblical contexts, including the examples of Noah, Elijah, and the prophetic books of Isaiah and Amos. The response effectively connects these examples to the notion of a faithful minority preserved by God amidst judgment. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more specifically on the biblical events cited in Isaiah and Amos that directly illustrate the concept of a remnant, as per the teacher's reference answer."
