## [Answer](../Historical_Context.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the concept of a "remnant" often refers to a faithful minority within the larger community who remains true to God and His commandments, even in times of widespread unfaithfulness and judgment.

One example of the remnant in the Old Testament can be seen in the story of Noah and the flood in Genesis 6-9. In this narrative, Noah and his family were the only ones found righteous in the eyes of God amidst a corrupt and sinful world. God spared them and used them to begin anew after the flood waters receded, demonstrating the idea of a remnant being preserved through divine judgment.

Another example of the remnant is found in the story of Elijah in 1 Kings 19. After fleeing from Queen Jezebel's threats, Elijah believed he was the only faithful prophet left in Israel. However, God reassured him that there were still 7,000 others who had not bowed down to Baal, highlighting the presence of a faithful remnant even in a culture dominated by idolatry.

In the prophetic books of Isaiah and Amos, the concept of the remnant is specifically mentioned in the context of judgment and restoration. Isaiah prophesied about a faithful remnant that would survive the Assyrian invasion and ultimately bring forth the Messiah (Isaiah 10:20-22, Isaiah 11:11-16). Similarly, Amos spoke of a remnant that would be saved after God's judgment on Israel for their sins (Amos 9:11-15).

These examples illustrate God's faithfulness to preserve a remnant of His people through times of judgment and to fulfill His purposes for redemption and restoration.
