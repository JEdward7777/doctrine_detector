The examples provided from the Old Testament narratives and prophetic books effectively illustrate the theme of a faithful minority being preserved by God amidst broader unfaithfulness or punishment. The connection to God's covenant and faithfulness is well articulated. However, a hint of further elaboration on how the remnant ties into God's promises in a more general sense could have added even more depth to the explanation."
