The mention of Isaiah's prophecy regarding the remnant returning to Canaan after exile and Amos' reference to God's preservation of a remnant despite judgment aligns well with the concern about understanding the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises. The response effectively demonstrates how God's faithfulness to preserve a faithful minority plays a crucial role in fulfilling His covenant promises throughout biblical history."
