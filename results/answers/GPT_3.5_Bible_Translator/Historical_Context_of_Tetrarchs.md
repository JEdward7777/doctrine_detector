## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies had several impacts on the Jewish people. One significant impact was the increase in Roman influence and control over Judea and the surrounding regions. The tetrarchs, who were appointed by the Roman authorities, were responsible for maintaining order and collecting taxes on behalf of Rome. This furthered the sense of occupation and oppression felt by the Jewish people.

Additionally, the division of the kingdom created political and social fragmentation among the Jewish population. The tetrarchs often competed with one another for power and influence, leading to instability and conflict within the region. This fragmentation weakened the Jewish people's ability to resist external threats and to maintain their cultural and religious identity.

Furthermore, the tetrarchies contributed to the overall sense of disillusionment and longing for a Messiah among the Jewish people. Many viewed the Roman-appointed tetrarchs as illegitimate rulers and longed for a leader who would deliver them from oppression and restore the kingdom of Israel. This cultural and political context set the stage for the eventual rise of messianic movements in the first century, including the ministry of Jesus Christ.
