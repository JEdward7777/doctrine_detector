  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained response that addresses the impacts of the division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies on the Jewish people. The answer demonstrates good understanding of the historical context. However, the response could have been more focused on the specific impact on governance, culture, and relations with Roman authorities, as outlined in the reference answer. The student's analysis was thorough but slightly deviated from the key concerns of governance and relations with Roman authorities."
