They effectively highlight the transformation of the cross from a symbol of shame and suffering to one of hope, redemption, and victory through Jesus' resurrection. The student effectively connects the historical context with the Christian message, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The minor deviation in the focus of the transformation of the symbol does not significantly detract from the overall quality of the response. Well done!"
