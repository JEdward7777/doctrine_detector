The response effectively communicates how altars were used as a means of worship, thanksgiving, seeking forgiveness, and communicating with God. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific significance of the acts of building altars in relation to inspiring Christians in their faith and devotion, as outlined in the concern. Additionally, the answer could have been more concise and directly related to the concern provided."
