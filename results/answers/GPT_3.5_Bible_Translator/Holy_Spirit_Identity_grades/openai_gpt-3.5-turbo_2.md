1. Helper and Comforter: Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is their helper and comforter who comes alongside them to guide, empower, and encourage them in their walk of faith. The Holy Spirit provides strength, wisdom, and comfort to believers in times of difficulty and trial.

2. Teacher and Illuminator: The Holy Spirit is also seen as the one who teaches and illuminates the truths of God's Word to believers. He helps Christians understand and apply the Scriptures to their lives, guiding them into all truth.

3. Sanctifier and Transformer: Christians believe that the Holy Spirit works in their lives to sanctify them, conforming them more and more to the image of Christ. The Holy Spirit convicts believers of sin, empowers them to live holy lives, and produces the fruit of the Spirit in their hearts.

4. Empowerer and Equipper: The Holy Spirit empowers and equips believers for ministry and service. Christians believe that the Holy Spirit bestows spiritual gifts on believers for the building up of the body of Christ and for the advancement of God's kingdom.

Overall, the identity of the Holy Spirit as God underscores the intimate and active role he plays in the lives of believers. Christians rely on the Holy Spirit for guidance, strength, transformation, and empowerment, recognizing him as an essential and indispensable presence in their walk of faith.
