  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer on introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit in contexts unfamiliar with the Trinity. They emphasized the importance of building a solid foundation of understanding, using biblical examples and stories, and affirming the Holy Spirit's role as part of the Triune God. The only minor point for improvement would be to explicitly mention introducing the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity from the outset to align more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
