  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the term \"hosts\" in scripture, covering its various contexts and meanings accurately. The connection between \"hosts\" as the armies of Israel, heavenly armies of angels, and celestial bodies is well-articulated. However, to improve the grade, the student could further elaborate on the significance of God's authority and sovereignty implied by the term \"hosts\" in each context and could also include references from other books in the Bible where the term is used."
