  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer showcasing a good understanding of the various contexts in which the term \"hosts\" is used in scripture. They incorporated Bible verses to support their points and highlighted the significance of the term in relation to God's power and authority. However, the student could have tied in the concept of spiritual warfare and divine authority more explicitly to address the concern provided."
