The connection to spiritual warfare and divine authority is effectively highlighted, demonstrating an understanding of how this knowledge can impact a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. The response could be further improved by explicitly tying in the Christian worldview perspective on the significance of spiritual warfare and divine authority in shaping a believer's approach to prayer and engagement in spiritual battles."
