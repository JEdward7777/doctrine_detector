  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85. The student's response incorporates relevant biblical references and highlights the importance of addressing jealousy through self-reflection, communication with one's partner, and trust in God. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern of reflecting on personal relationships and the impact of jealousy. Despite this, the student's answer aligns well with Christian principles and provides practical advice for managing feelings of jealousy in relationships."
