The inclusion of prayer and reflection demonstrates spiritual maturity. The emphasis on open communication, humility, and cultivating trust aligns with the reference answer. \n\nHowever, the student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of \"met expectations\" as a potential root of jealousy. Additionally, the student could have elaborated on the importance of forgiveness as part of the healing process from jealousy."
