  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively integrates biblical teachings on jealousy, emphasizing the importance of self-reflection, communication, and faith in addressing jealousy in relationships. It acknowledges the negative consequences of jealousy and offers practical steps rooted in Christian principles to foster trust, open communication, and contentment. The response could have further elaborated on the role of forgiveness and seeking guidance from God in overcoming jealousy in relationships, but overall, it provides a solid Christian worldview perspective on the issue."
