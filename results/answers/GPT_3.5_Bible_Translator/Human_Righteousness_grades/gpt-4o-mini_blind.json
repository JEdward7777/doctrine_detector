The inclusion of scriptural reference from Romans 3:22-24 adds validity to the response. However, there could have been a deeper exploration of the concept of justification by faith alone, and how this differs from justification by works. Nevertheless, the explanation is doctrinally sound and effectively conveys the essence of Christian belief on righteousness."
