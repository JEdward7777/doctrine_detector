  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and accurate explanation of how a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ, citing relevant biblical references. The student correctly emphasizes the role of faith in Jesus and His atoning sacrifice in the process of justification. The response aligns well with the Christian belief that righteousness is not earned through works but received through faith in Jesus. The only slight deviation is the missed mention of God cleansing from sins and attributing Jesus' righteousness, which was present in the reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
