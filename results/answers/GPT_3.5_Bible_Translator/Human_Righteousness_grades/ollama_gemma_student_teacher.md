A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesusâ€™ righteousness to them.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian belief, a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. According to the Bible, in Romans 3:22-24, it says, "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus."

This means that through faith in Jesus, acknowledging and confessing our sins, and accepting the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross for our sins, we are justified before God. It is not through our own good works or efforts that we can earn righteousness, but through faith in Jesus and His finished work on the cross.
