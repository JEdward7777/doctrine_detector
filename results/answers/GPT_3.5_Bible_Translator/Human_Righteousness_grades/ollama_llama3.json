  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe response effectively conveys that faith in Jesus Christ is the means by which humans can be declared righteous, aligning with the concern to clarify the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus. The scriptural reference to Romans 3:22-24 provides additional support and authority for this understanding.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide a more detailed explanation of what it means to \"trust in Jesus\" or have \"faith in Jesus,\" such as emphasizing the importance of acknowledging one's sinfulness, accepting Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, and receiving His gift of righteousness. However, overall, the response accurately addresses the concern and provides a clear and concise summary of the biblical teaching on human righteousness.\n\nComment: This response effectively communicates the central message that faith in Jesus is the key to being declared righteous before God. With a bit more development on what it means to have faith in Jesus, this could be an even stronger answer."
