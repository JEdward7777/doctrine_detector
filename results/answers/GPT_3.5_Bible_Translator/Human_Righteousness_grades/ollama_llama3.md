## Question [Human Righteousness](../../../questions/Human_Righteousness.md)
How can a person be declared righteous according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesusâ€™ righteousness to them.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian belief, a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. According to the Bible, in Romans 3:22-24, it says, "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus."

This means that through faith in Jesus, acknowledging and confessing our sins, and accepting the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross for our sins, we are justified before God. It is not through our own good works or efforts that we can earn righteousness, but through faith in Jesus and His finished work on the cross.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 95.

The response effectively conveys that faith in Jesus Christ is the means by which humans can be declared righteous, aligning with the concern to clarify the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus. The scriptural reference to Romans 3:22-24 provides additional support and authority for this understanding.

The only area for improvement would be to provide a more detailed explanation of what it means to "trust in Jesus" or have "faith in Jesus," such as emphasizing the importance of acknowledging one's sinfulness, accepting Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, and receiving His gift of righteousness. However, overall, the response accurately addresses the concern and provides a clear and concise summary of the biblical teaching on human righteousness.

Comment: This response effectively communicates the central message that faith in Jesus is the key to being declared righteous before God. With a bit more development on what it means to have faith in Jesus, this could be an even stronger answer.
