  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of God calling individuals by name, touching on the deep personal relationship, specific purpose, and intimate knowledge God has for each believer. The response effectively conveys the message of God's love, care, and sovereignty over believers. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly state that God's calling signifies choosing individuals for a relationship with Him, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher."
