## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
When God says, "I have called you by name," it signifies a deep personal relationship between God and the individual. In the Bible, this phrase is often used to convey the idea that God knows each person intimately and has a specific purpose and plan for their life. 

For example, in Isaiah 43:1, God says, "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are mine." This verse reassures believers that they belong to God and are precious to Him. It conveys the message that God has a unique calling and purpose for each person, and that He knows them intimately, down to the very core of their being.

Ultimately, when God says, "I have called you by name," it is a reminder of His love, care, and personal involvement in the lives of His people. It is a powerful declaration of God's sovereignty and His desire for a relationship with each of us.
