  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student provided a detailed explanation of the significance of the name 'Jesus' in relation to God's salvation for humanity. They accurately mentioned the Hebrew origin of the name and its meaning, tying it to Jesus's role as Savior. Additionally, they referenced a relevant Bible verse to support their explanation.\n\nHowever, the student's response was slightly longer and more elaborate than the reference answer, which could have been more concise. Nonetheless, they effectively addressed the concern regarding the significance of Jesus's name and His role as Savior from a Christian worldview."
