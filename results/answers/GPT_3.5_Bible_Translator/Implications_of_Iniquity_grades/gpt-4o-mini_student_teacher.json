  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive answer that effectively explains how the understanding of iniquity as harmful acts influences a Christian's behavior toward others. The response emphasizes the importance of living in accordance with God's commands, promoting humility, forgiveness, and reconciliation in relationships. The student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, but could be slightly more concise and focused to enhance clarity. Overall, a solid understanding and application of Christian principles are demonstrated in the response."
