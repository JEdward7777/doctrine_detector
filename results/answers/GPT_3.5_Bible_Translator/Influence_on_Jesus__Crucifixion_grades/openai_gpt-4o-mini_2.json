It effectively connects their actions to Jesus' condemnation of selfishness and hypocrisy. The explanation draws out the relevance of understanding this conflict for contemporary faith, emphasizing the importance of genuine faith, humility, and the recognition of truth. The response could further deepen the connection to the Christian worldview by explicitly discussing how individuals today can avoid falling into similar traps of selfishness and hypocrisy in their faith journey. Overall, a strong and well-supported analysis."
