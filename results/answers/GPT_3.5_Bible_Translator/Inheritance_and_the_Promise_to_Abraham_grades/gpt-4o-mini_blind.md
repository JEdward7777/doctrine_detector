God promised Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan as an inheritance. In Genesis 13:14-17, God said to Abraham, "Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted." This promise was reaffirmed to Abraham's son Isaac and his grandson Jacob, who later became Israel.
