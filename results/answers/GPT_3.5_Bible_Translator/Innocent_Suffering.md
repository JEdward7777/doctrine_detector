## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of "innocent blood" is referenced in various passages throughout the Bible, particularly in the context of murder and injustice. The shedding of innocent blood is seen as a grave sin and a violation of God's commandments. In the Old Testament, we see examples such as Cain's murder of Abel (Genesis 4:10) and the prophet Isaiah condemning those who shed innocent blood (Isaiah 59:7).

In the New Testament, the innocence of Jesus Christ is emphasized, highlighting the ultimate sacrificial offering of His innocent blood for the forgiveness of sins (Hebrews 9:14). This concept underscores the value of every human life, as Jesus' death on the cross demonstrates the extent of God's love for humanity and the immense value He places on each individual.

The Bible teaches that all human life is precious and created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). The shedding of innocent blood is not only a crime against humanity but also a sin against God Himself. This underscores the sanctity and value of life in the eyes of God and emphasizes the importance of upholding justice and protecting the vulnerable in society.
