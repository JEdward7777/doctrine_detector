## [Answer](../Interpreting_Divine_Glory.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Divine glory can be understood in the context of worship as the manifestation of God's greatness, holiness, and majesty. When we recognize and acknowledge God's divine glory, we are expressing our reverence, awe, and adoration towards Him. Worship is a response to the revelation of God's glory, and it involves humbly submitting ourselves to His authority and praising Him for who He is and what He has done.

In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for glory, "kavod," is often used to describe God's presence and radiance. For example, in Isaiah 6:3, the seraphim cry out, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!" This demonstrates how God's glory is inseparable from His holiness and perfection.

In the New Testament, the Greek word for glory, "doxa," is used to describe the splendor and majesty of God revealed in Jesus Christ. John 1:14 says, "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth." Through Jesus, we see the ultimate revelation of God's glory, as He is the exact representation of God's nature (Hebrews 1:3).

In worship, we acknowledge and respond to God's divine glory by praising Him, giving thanks, and surrendering our lives to Him. As we encounter God's glory, our hearts are filled with awe and wonder, and our desire to honor and glorify Him grows. Worship becomes a transformative experience as we are drawn closer to God and reflect His glory in our lives.

Ultimately, the purpose of worship is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. When we magnify His glory in our worship, we are fulfilling our created purpose and experiencing the fullness of joy in His presence.
