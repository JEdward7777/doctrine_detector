The student effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of recognizing God's glory in influencing Christian worship practices and expressions of reverence and awe. The integration of biblical references and theological reflection demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept from a Christian worldview. The only slight room for improvement would be to further emphasize the crucial role of recognizing God's glory in shaping how Christians express reverence and awe towards Him throughout the entire response."
