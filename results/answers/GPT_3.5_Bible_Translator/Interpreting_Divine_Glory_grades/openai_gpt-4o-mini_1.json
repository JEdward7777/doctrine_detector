It effectively uses Old and New Testament references to support the concept of divine glory and emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's glory in worship practices. The only minor suggestion would be to further emphasize the transformative nature of encountering God's glory in worship, but overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview."
