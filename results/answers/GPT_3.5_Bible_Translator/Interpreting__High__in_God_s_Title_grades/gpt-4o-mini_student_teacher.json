  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful interpretation of the term \"high\" in the title \"Most High,\" highlighting God's supremacy, sovereignty, and exalted position. However, there was a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer in not explicitly mentioning that \"high\" refers to greatness and authority, rather than physical height. The student's response effectively conveyed the deep theological significance of God's exalted nature, but could have been strengthened by more directly aligning with the concern of avoiding misconceptions about God's nature."
