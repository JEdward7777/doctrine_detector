  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the theological concept of God's supremacy and authority as reflected in the title \"Most High.\" The explanation emphasizes the spiritual and transcendent nature of God, avoiding misconceptions about physical height. The student effectively connects the term \"high\" with God's greatness, power, and majesty. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the metaphorical use of descriptive titles in theological language."
