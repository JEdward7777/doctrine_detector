# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Most High" is a title ascribed to God in the Bible to emphasize His position and authority above all creation. In terms of interpreting the term "high" in this context, it generally refers to God's supremacy, sovereignty, and exalted position in the universe. It underscores the fact that God is above all things, transcendent, and beyond human comprehension.

When we refer to God as the "Most High," we are acknowledging His absolute superiority, power, and majesty. It signifies that there is no one and nothing that can compare to or rival God in His greatness and authority. This title invites us to recognize and honor God for who He truly is â€“ the Almighty, the Creator of the universe, the ruler of all things.

In summary, interpreting the term "high" in the title "Most High" leads us to grasp the concept of God's eminence, supremacy, and unmatched glory in the universe. It calls us to worship and reverence Him with awe and humility, recognizing His infinite greatness and sovereignty.
