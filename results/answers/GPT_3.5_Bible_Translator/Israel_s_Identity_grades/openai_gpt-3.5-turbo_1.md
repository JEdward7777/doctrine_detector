# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The name "Israel" holds significant meaning in the Bible, as it is derived from the story of Jacob in the book of Genesis. Jacob, son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham, had a profound encounter with God where his name was changed to Israel, which means "he struggles with God" or "God contends." This name change signified Jacob's transformation and spiritual wrestling with God.

Furthermore, the name "Israel" became associated with the people of God, the descendants of Jacob, who formed the nation of Israel. Throughout the Bible, the term is used to refer to the covenant people of God, chosen and set apart for His purposes. The nation of Israel played a crucial role in the biblical narrative as the recipients of God's promises, the custodians of His law, and the lineage through which the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would come.

In essence, the name "Israel" signifies a deep spiritual connection between God and His chosen people, reflecting both the struggles and blessings that come from a relationship with the Almighty.
