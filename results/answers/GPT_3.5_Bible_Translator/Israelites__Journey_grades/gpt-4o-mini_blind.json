The inclusion of scriptural references and examples from the Old Testament is commendable. The explanation of God's provision, protection, power, and discipline is thorough and accurate. One area for improvement could be expanding on how God's faithfulness ties into the broader narrative of salvation history and pointing to Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises."
