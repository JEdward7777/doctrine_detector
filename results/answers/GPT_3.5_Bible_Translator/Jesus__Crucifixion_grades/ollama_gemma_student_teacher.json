  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of Jesus' refusal of the wine and myrrh. The student provides a clear explanation of the potential benefits of the mixture as a painkiller and offers a compelling argument that Jesus' rejection of it was a deliberate act of selflessness and obedience. The response also connects Jesus' suffering to his sacrificial role and emphasizes the completeness of his redemption plan."
