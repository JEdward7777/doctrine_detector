  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThe response does a great job of expanding on the initial answer, providing additional context about myrrh's properties and Jesus' decision to refuse the mixture. It also effectively explores the theological significance of Jesus' refusal, highlighting his selflessness, obedience, and commitment to carrying out God's plan for redemption. The writing is clear, concise, and well-structured.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that some of the sentences could be tightened up for even greater clarity and impact. For example, the phrase \"in order to fulfill God's plan for redemption\" feels a bit repetitive and could be rephrased for more punch.\n\nOverall, however, this response does an excellent job of exploring the concern and providing meaningful insights into Jesus' suffering and commitment to his mission."
