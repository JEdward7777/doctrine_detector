  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer that aligns with the Christian belief on Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. They effectively discussed Jesus' divinity, power over death, and role as the Savior offering eternal life. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the exclusivity of Jesus as the only way to eternal life, and the impact of this statement on believers' faith and theological understanding. Overall, a solid interpretation but with slight room for improvement in depth and theological implications."
