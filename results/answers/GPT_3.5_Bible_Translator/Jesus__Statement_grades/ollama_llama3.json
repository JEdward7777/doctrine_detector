  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response accurately reflects Jesus' statement in John 11:25, explaining that He is the source of eternal life and has power over death. It also correctly highlights Jesus' demonstration of this power through raising Lazarus from the dead. Furthermore, it emphasizes Jesus' role as the Savior who offers eternal life to all who believe in Him.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more context about Jesus' statement and its significance within the broader narrative of John's Gospel. Additionally, while it mentions Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, it does not explicitly connect this event to His resurrection and its implications for believers.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, but could benefit from further development and nuance."
