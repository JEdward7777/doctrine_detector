  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings, highlighting its significance and truthfulness. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, as the reference answer does. The student effectively conveyed the importance of Jesus using \"amen\" to draw attention to the divine origin and certainty of His teachings, but a more direct connection to the authority of His words as revealed in Scripture would have enhanced the response."
