  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This answer provides a solid explanation of Jesus as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek and the significance of his sacrifice in comparison to the sacrifices made by human priests in the Old Testament. The student effectively communicates the concept of Jesus' role as the ultimate and perfect sacrifice for sin, drawing out the theological richness of his priesthood. The answer also appropriately addresses the ongoing intercessory role of Jesus for believers. Well done!"
