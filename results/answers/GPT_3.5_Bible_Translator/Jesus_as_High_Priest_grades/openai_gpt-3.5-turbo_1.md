## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek. This is significant because the traditional Jewish priesthood, descended from Aaron, offered sacrifices for sin on behalf of the people. However, Jesus, as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek, offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin once and for all.

This means that the sacrifices made by human priests in the Old Testament were only temporary and needed to be repeated regularly. But Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was perfect and complete, able to atone for all sin for all time. As a result, there is no longer a need for ongoing sacrifices by human priests, as Jesus' sacrifice fulfilled the ultimate purpose of the sacrificial system.

Jesus' role as a high priest also means that he now intercedes on behalf of believers before God, offering his own perfect sacrifice as the basis for our forgiveness and reconciliation with God. This gives Christians confidence and assurance that our sins are forgiven and that we can approach God boldly in prayer through Jesus, our high priest.
