## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the ultimate High Priest who fulfills and surpasses the role of the high priests of the Old Testament. The book of Hebrews, in particular, emphasizes Jesus as the great High Priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses and who has offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for our sins.

Hebrews 4:14-15 says, "Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin."

Furthermore, Hebrews 7:26-27 describes Jesus as the perfect High Priest: "For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself."

This passage highlights that Jesus, as the High Priest, offered himself as the perfect and final sacrifice for our sins, unlike the Old Testament high priests who had to continually offer sacrifices for themselves and the people. Jesus is seen as the mediator between God and humanity, who intercedes on our behalf before God.

Overall, the New Testament presents Jesus as the ultimate High Priest who embodies the qualities of holiness, purity, and sacrifice, fulfilling the Old Testament priesthood and reconciling humanity to God through his atoning sacrifice on the cross.
