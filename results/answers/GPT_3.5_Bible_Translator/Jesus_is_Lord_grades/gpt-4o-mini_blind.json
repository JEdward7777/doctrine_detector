  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid response that effectively emphasizes the theological significance of the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" in contrast to the cultural use of the term \"lord\" for political leaders. The answer appropriately highlights the unique and supreme authority of Jesus Christ as central to the Christian faith. The mention of clarity, reverence, and respect for cultural context demonstrates a thoughtful approach to conveying this important distinction. Great job overall!"
