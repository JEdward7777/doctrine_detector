  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85.\n\nThe student effectively addresses the concern by explaining the biblical significance of the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" as proclaiming Jesus's divine lordship and ultimate authority. They emphasize the difference between Jesus' lordship and the titles given to political leaders, highlighting the unique and supreme authority of Jesus Christ. Additionally, the student suggests a strategy for communicating this distinction by emphasizing Jesus as the Son of God.\n\nWhile the student's response is comprehensive and well-supported, the reference answer from the teacher is more concise and directly addresses the concern without unnecessary elaboration. Therefore, I deduct a few points for the student's answer being slightly verbose in comparison to the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and provided a solid response within a Christian worldview."
