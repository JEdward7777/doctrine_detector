  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the theological significance of \"Jesus is Lord\" and the need for clarity in communicating it in a context where political leaders are also called \"lord.\" The explanation emphasizes the unique and supreme authority of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, distinguishing it from human authority. The response is well-written and respectful of the cultural context."
