  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern by providing clear explanations to differentiate between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. It accurately conveys that \"Jesus is Lord\" signifies His divine authority and supremacy over all creation, distinct from human rulers. The writer also emphasizes the importance of conveying the Christian message with clarity and reverence in various cultural contexts.\n\nThe only area for improvement is minor and relates to the tone. While the response is clear and accurate, it may benefit from a slightly more passionate or emphatic tone to underscore the significance of Jesus' lordship.\n\nComment: The writer has done an excellent job addressing the concern by providing distinct explanations between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. With a slight adjustment in tone, this response would be even stronger."
