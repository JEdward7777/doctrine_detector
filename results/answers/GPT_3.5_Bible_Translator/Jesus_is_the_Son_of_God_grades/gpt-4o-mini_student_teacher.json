  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates thoughtfulness and respect in considering the translation of \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context. While their suggestion of translating it as \"Jesus is the Messiah\" or \"Jesus is the chosen one of God\" does attempt to minimize potential offense, it falls short of maintaining the original terminology as recommended by the teacher. The student's answer could be improved by incorporating clearer teaching and context to explain the original meaning in a Biblically accurate manner."
