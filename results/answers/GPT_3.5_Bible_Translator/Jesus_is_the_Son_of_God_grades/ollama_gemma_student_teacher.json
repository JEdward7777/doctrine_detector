  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful approach to translating the theological statement \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context. \n\nThe suggested translation \"Jesus is the Messiah\" or \"Jesus is the chosen one of God\" is appropriate as it acknowledges the unique role of Jesus in both Christian and Islamic beliefs without explicitly claiming divine sonship. \n\nAdditionally, providing context and explanation can aid in fostering understanding and dialogue between different faith traditions. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by elaborating on the significance of the Trinity in Christianity and its relevance to the understanding of Jesus as the Son of God."
