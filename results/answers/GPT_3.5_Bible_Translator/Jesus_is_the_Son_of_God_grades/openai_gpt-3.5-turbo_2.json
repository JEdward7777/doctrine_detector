However, the suggested translation provided deviates from the original text and the core Christian belief, which may not fully convey the intended meaning. While the response attempts to navigate the sensitivity of the topic in a Muslim context, it falls short in presenting a translation that is consistent with the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God."
