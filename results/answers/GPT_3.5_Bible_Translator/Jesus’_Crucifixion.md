## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
When Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh while on the cross, it was meant to act as a sort of painkiller or sedative to help alleviate His suffering. Myrrh was a bitter herb used in ancient times for pain relief or anesthesia, and mixing it with wine made it more palatable. However, Jesus chose not to drink it, symbolizing His full acceptance of the suffering He was called to endure for the salvation of humanity. By refusing the pain-relieving mixture, Jesus showed His complete willingness to experience the full extent of physical and spiritual agony on the cross in order to fulfill God's plan for redemption. This act demonstrates Jesus' selflessness, obedience, and commitment to carrying out His redemptive mission to its completion.
