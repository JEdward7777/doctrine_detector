  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the biblical instructions on how Christians should judge each other, highlighting the importance of self-reflection, love, grace, and forgiveness. The student effectively references relevant passages such as Matthew 7:1-5 and Romans 14:13 to support their points. However, the answer could have been improved by directly quoting the reference answer provided by the teacher and by including more specific references to support the discussion on encouraging and supporting one another's growth in faith, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a solid interpretation from a Christian worldview."
