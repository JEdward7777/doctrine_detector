  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response correctly identifies the biblical principle of not judging others harshly or condemning them, which aligns with the concern about approaching relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner. The passage from Matthew 7:1-5 is particularly relevant to this topic and is well-interpreted in the response.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of Romans 14:13 reinforces the idea that believers should focus on showing love, grace, and forgiveness to one another rather than passing judgment.\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is by explicitly connecting these biblical principles to practical applications within Christian relationships. While the response mentions the importance of humility, understanding, and compassion, it could benefit from more specific examples or scenarios that illustrate how Christians can put these values into practice in their daily lives.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides relevant biblical support."
