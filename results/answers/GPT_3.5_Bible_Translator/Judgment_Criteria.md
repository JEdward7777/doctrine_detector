## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Bible, individuals will be judged on the day of judgment based on their deeds and faith. In Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus speaks about the judgment of the nations, where the Son of Man separates the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats based on their actions towards others. Those who have shown compassion and love to others are welcomed into the kingdom of heaven, while those who have neglected to care for others are condemned.

Additionally, in Romans 2:6-8, it is mentioned that God "will repay each person according to what they have done." This passage highlights that God's judgment will be just and based on each individual's actions.

Furthermore, faith in Jesus Christ is also a crucial aspect of judgment. In John 3:16, it is stated that whoever believes in Jesus will have eternal life. Faith in Jesus as the Son of God and Savior is essential for salvation.

Overall, individuals will be judged based on their deeds, their faith in Jesus Christ, and their heart towards others on the day of judgment according to the biblical perspective.
