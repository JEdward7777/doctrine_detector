The references to Matthew 25:31-46 and Romans 2:6-8 support the points made in the response. However, it would have been beneficial to include more specific references to passages that emphasize the crucial role of faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the theological implications of judgment based on deeds and faith could have enriched the explanation. Overall, a solid response with room for further development."
