  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of how individuals will be judged according to the biblical perspective, referencing relevant passages such as Matthew 25:31-46 and Romans 2:6-8. The inclusion of the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for salvation is also commendable. The student effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the connection between individuals' actions and lives in relation to the righteous character of Christ. However, the reference answer provides a more concise and direct response that focuses specifically on the alignment with the righteous character of Christ, which the student's answer slightly deviates from, hence the slightly lower grade."
