  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively incorporates biblical references such as Matthew 25:31-46 and Romans 2:6-8 to support the idea that individuals will be judged based on their actions and faith in Jesus Christ. It aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of living in accordance with biblical principles and demonstrating compassion and love towards others. The student could have further emphasized the necessity of repentance and forgiveness in the context of judgment, but overall, the response provides a solid Christian perspective on the topic."
