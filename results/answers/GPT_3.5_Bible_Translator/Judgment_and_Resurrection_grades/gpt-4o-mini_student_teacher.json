  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the events associated with the day of the Lord in Christian eschatology. They correctly mentioned the second coming of Jesus Christ, the final judgment of all humanity, and the destruction of the wicked and the restoration of God's people. The student also highlighted key verses from the Bible to support their points. However, the student's answer was more detailed and expanded on specific events compared to the reference answer, but still aligned with the Christian worldview."
