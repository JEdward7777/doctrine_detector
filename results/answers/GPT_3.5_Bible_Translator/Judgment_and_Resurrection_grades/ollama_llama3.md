## [Answer](../Judgment_and_Resurrection.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the "day of Yahweh" or the "day of the Lord" typically refers to a time of judgment and divine intervention in human affairs. This day is often characterized by the coming of the Lord to establish His reign, to bring about justice, and to judge the wicked.

Some events associated with the day of the Lord in the Bible include:

1. The second coming of Jesus Christ - There are multiple references in the New Testament to Jesus returning in power and glory to judge the living and the dead (Matthew 24:30-31, 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).

2. The final judgment of all humanity - The day of the Lord is described as a time when all people will be judged according to their deeds, and those who have rejected God will face eternal punishment (Revelation 20:12-15).

3. The destruction of the wicked and the restoration of God's people - The day of the Lord is also associated with the defeat of evil and the restoration of God's creation. This includes the defeat of the devil, the destruction of all evil powers, and the establishment of God's kingdom in its fullness (Revelation 20:10, 21:1-4).

Overall, the day of the Lord is a time of both judgment and salvation, where God's justice and mercy will be fully revealed to all people.
