## [Answer](../Judgment_of_Others.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Jesus teaches us in the Bible to first address and confront our own faults before pointing out the faults of others. In the Gospel of Matthew 7:3-5, Jesus says, "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."

This teaching emphasizes the importance of humility and self-reflection before judging or criticizing others. We are called to address our own faults and shortcomings first, before helping others with theirs. Jesus reminds us that we are all sinners in need of grace and redemption, and that compassion and understanding should guide our interactions with others.
