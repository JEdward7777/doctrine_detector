  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively references the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 7:3-5 to emphasize the importance of humility and self-reflection before criticizing others. It highlights the Christian value of addressing our own faults before pointing out those of others. The connection to the concern regarding hypocrisy and maintaining a strong Christian witness is well-supported and aligns with Christian teachings. Great job in integrating biblical principles to address the concern given."
