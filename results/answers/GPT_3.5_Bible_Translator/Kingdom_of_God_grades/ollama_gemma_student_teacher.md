## Question [Kingdom of God](../../../questions/Kingdom_of_God.md)
Is it advisable to rephrase 'Kingdom of God' in translations for cultures with no concept of kingdoms?

## Correct Answer
No, retain 'Kingdom of God' and provide explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance.

Rephrasing could lose the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God'.

## [Answer](../Kingdom_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In situations where a culture has no concept of kingdoms, it may be advisable to rephrase "Kingdom of God" in a way that conveys the intended meaning of God's rule or sovereign reign. Some alternatives you could consider include "Rule of God," "Reign of God," or "Dominion of God."

It is important to maintain the integrity of the original meaning while ensuring that the message is clear and understandable to the target audience. Prayerful consideration and consultation with local experts or consultants can help determine the most appropriate phrasing in order to convey the truth of God's sovereignty in a culturally relevant way.

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concern and provides a well-reasoned solution. The suggestion of alternative phrasings demonstrates sensitivity to different cultural contexts while maintaining the integrity of the original concept. However, retaining the original term "Kingdom of God" alongside explanations would provide greater clarity for those familiar with the biblical context.
