  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response partially addresses the concern about retaining the depth and biblical context of the term \"Kingdom of God\". The suggested alternatives, such as \"Rule of God\", \"Reign of God\", or \"Dominion of God\", acknowledge the importance of conveying the intended meaning of God's sovereignty in a culturally relevant way. However, it does not fully address the concern since it still suggests rephrasing the term.\n\nThe response is strongest when it emphasizes the need for prayerful consideration and consultation with local experts to ensure that the message remains clear and understandable while maintaining the integrity of the original meaning. This shows an awareness of the importance of cultural relevance in communication, which is essential in sharing the Gospel.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly stated its commitment to retaining the term \"Kingdom of God\" and emphasized its significance in biblical context, rather than suggesting alternatives."
