No, retain 'Kingdom of God' and provide explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance.

## [Answer](../Kingdom_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In situations where a culture has no concept of kingdoms, it may be advisable to rephrase "Kingdom of God" in a way that conveys the intended meaning of God's rule or sovereign reign. Some alternatives you could consider include "Rule of God," "Reign of God," or "Dominion of God."

It is important to maintain the integrity of the original meaning while ensuring that the message is clear and understandable to the target audience. Prayerful consideration and consultation with local experts or consultants can help determine the most appropriate phrasing in order to convey the truth of God's sovereignty in a culturally relevant way.

Grade: 85

This response partially addresses the concern about retaining the depth and biblical context of the term "Kingdom of God". The suggested alternatives, such as "Rule of God", "Reign of God", or "Dominion of God", acknowledge the importance of conveying the intended meaning of God's sovereignty in a culturally relevant way. However, it does not fully address the concern since it still suggests rephrasing the term.

The response is strongest when it emphasizes the need for prayerful consideration and consultation with local experts to ensure that the message remains clear and understandable while maintaining the integrity of the original meaning. This shows an awareness of the importance of cultural relevance in communication, which is essential in sharing the Gospel.

To achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly stated its commitment to retaining the term "Kingdom of God" and emphasized its significance in biblical context, rather than suggesting alternatives.
