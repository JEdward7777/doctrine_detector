The suggestion to retain the term and provide explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance aligns well with a Christian worldview that values conveying the full truth and meaning of biblical concepts. While the original answer could have been further strengthened by emphasizing the importance of effectively communicating the significance of the term within the cultural context, overall it offers a solid approach in addressing the concern."
