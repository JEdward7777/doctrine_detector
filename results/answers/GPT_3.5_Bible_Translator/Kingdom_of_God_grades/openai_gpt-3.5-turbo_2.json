  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-considered and balanced approach to maintaining the term \"Kingdom of God\" while also addressing the concern about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term. The suggestion to retain the original term while also providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance demonstrates a commitment to preserving the integrity of the term while ensuring it is understood in different cultural contexts. Overall, the response reflects a thoughtful consideration of the issue from a Christian worldview."
