While suggesting prayerful consideration and consulting with experts is valuable, the emphasis on retaining the original term and providing explanations aligns well with maintaining the integrity of the biblical concept. Prayerful consideration can also involve seeking divine guidance on how to effectively communicate the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term 'Kingdom of God' to a culture unfamiliar with the concept."
