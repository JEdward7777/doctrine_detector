  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a balanced perspective by acknowledging the importance of retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' for its depth and biblical context, while also suggesting the possibility of providing explanations to help convey its spiritual and eschatological significance to those unfamiliar with the concept. This approach respects the integrity of the term while aiming to make it more accessible to a culture without a concept of kingdoms. Overall, the response shows a thoughtful consideration of both concerns."
