It is important to retain the term 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' in the Book of Matthew for several reasons:

1. **Biblical Accuracy**: The term 'kingdom of heaven' is used in the Book of Matthew as a way to refer to the kingdom of God. While the other Gospels often use the term 'kingdom of God', Matthew uses 'kingdom of heaven' as a way to show reverence and respect for God by avoiding the direct use of the name of God.

2. **Theological Significance**: 'Heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' reminds us that the ultimate rule and reign of this kingdom comes from God in heaven. It emphasizes the heavenly origin and nature of God's kingdom, which is not of this world but is a divine and eternal kingdom.

3. **Distinctiveness**: Retaining the term 'heaven' in the phrase helps to distinguish between the earthly kingdoms and rulers of this world and the spiritual kingdom of God. It highlights the transcendent and heavenly nature of God's kingdom as opposed to earthly kingdoms that are temporal and fallible.

4. **Symbolism**: 'Heaven' symbolizes the dwelling place of God and the eternal realm where His presence is fully manifest. By using the term 'kingdom of heaven', Matthew is pointing to the spiritual and divine reality of God's kingdom that is beyond our earthly understanding.

In conclusion, retaining the term 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' in the Book of Matthew is important for maintaining biblical accuracy, emphasizing the theological significance, highlighting the distinctiveness of God's kingdom, and symbolizing the transcendent nature of His eternal kingdom.
