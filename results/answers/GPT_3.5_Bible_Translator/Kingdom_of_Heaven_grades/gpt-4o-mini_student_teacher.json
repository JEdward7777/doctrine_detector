  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained answer that addresses the importance of retaining the term 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' in the Book of Matthew. They have covered multiple aspects such as biblical accuracy, theological significance, distinctiveness, and symbolism, effectively connecting them to the unique terminology used in Matthew's gospel. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective. However, the answer could be more concise to align closely with the teacher's reference answer."
