80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately states that most of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which aligns with the given answer. However, it also mentions Aramaic as a language used in specific sections of the Old Testament, which is an important additional detail. This shows that the respondent has done some digging and is not simply regurgitating a superficial understanding.

The only deduction I would make is that the response could be even stronger if it explicitly emphasized the importance of this knowledge for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context, as specified in the concern. While the response does touch on the idea of understanding the original context, it could be more explicit about why this knowledge is essential.

Overall, I think the grade of 80 reflects a solid effort to provide accurate information while also showing some depth and insight.
