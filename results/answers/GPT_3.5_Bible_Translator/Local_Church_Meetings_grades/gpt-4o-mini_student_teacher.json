The answer references relevant biblical passages and theological principles to support the practices of early Christians in meeting in homes for worship and fellowship. The inclusion of Hebrews 10:24-25 further emphasizes the biblical mandate for believers to gather together for mutual encouragement and support. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the concern by emphasizing the role of local fellowship in fostering spiritual growth and unity among believers in a specific city."
