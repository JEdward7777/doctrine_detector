## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Romans 8:23 states, "And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies." This verse implies that believers in Christ are eagerly waiting for the final stage of their adoption as sons and daughters of God, which is the redemption of their bodies. This indicates that there is a future aspect to our salvation that is yet to be fully realized.

For believers, this waiting process is a time of hope and anticipation for the culmination of their relationship with God, where they will experience the fullness of their adoption as God's beloved children. It also suggests that there may be struggles and challenges in the present life, but these will be ultimately overcome by the redemptive work of God.

Overall, Romans 8:23 points to the promise of a future glory and transformation for believers, where they will be fully united with God and experience the fullness of their identity as His sons and daughters. It encourages believers to persevere in faith and eagerly await the fulfillment of this promise.
