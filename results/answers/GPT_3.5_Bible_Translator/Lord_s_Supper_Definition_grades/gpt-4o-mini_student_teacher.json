  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith, emphasizing its connection to Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross and the symbolism of the bread and wine. While the student's answer aligns well with Christian beliefs and scripture, the reference answer specifically mentions the Passover meal as the event being commemorated during the Lord's Supper. The student's response could have been improved by including this specific connection to the Passover meal in their explanation."
