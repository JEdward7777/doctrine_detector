## [Answer](../Lord_s_Supper_Definition.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist, commemorates the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ on the cross. Christians believe that during the Last Supper, Jesus instituted this practice to remember His sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins and to proclaim His death until He comes again (1 Corinthians 11:23-26). The bread symbolizes Jesus' body broken for us, and the wine (or grape juice) symbolizes His blood shed for the forgiveness of sins. It is a spiritual discipline that unites believers with Christ and with one another in a special way.
