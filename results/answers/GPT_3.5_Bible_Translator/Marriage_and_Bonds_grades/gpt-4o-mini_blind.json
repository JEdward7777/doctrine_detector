The use of Ephesians 5:31-33 to support the view is commendable. The advice provided to couples on how they should view their commitment to each other aligns well with Christian teachings, emphasizing love, faithfulness, mutual respect, and partnership. The inclusion of the importance of seeking God's guidance and supporting each other's spiritual growth is also well-stated. Great job overall!"
