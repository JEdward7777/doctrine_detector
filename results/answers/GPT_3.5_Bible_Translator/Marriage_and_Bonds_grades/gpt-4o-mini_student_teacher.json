  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated explanation of the significance of the 'bond of marriage' from a Christian perspective, tying it to the relationship between Christ and the Church. The answer incorporates relevant biblical references and emphasizes the importance of love, honor, faithfulness, and partnership in marriage. The response aligns with the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships. However, there could be a more explicit connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher, focusing on the idea of a sacred commitment that should not be broken."
