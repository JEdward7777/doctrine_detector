  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate list of where the names of the twelve disciples can be found in the Bible. However, they included the Gospel of Acts, which does not explicitly list the twelve disciples. They demonstrated a good understanding of the Gospel accounts but could have paid closer attention to the specific concern of the question regarding the teachings associated with the disciples."
