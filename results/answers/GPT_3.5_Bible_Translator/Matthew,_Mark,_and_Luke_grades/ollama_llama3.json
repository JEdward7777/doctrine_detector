  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the student correctly identifies that the names of the twelve disciples can be found in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, their answer does not accurately reflect the extent to which these names are listed. The student's answer does not specify the exact chapters and verses where the names are listed, whereas the original response provides this detail.\n\nIn terms of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, this response shows some basic understanding, but could be improved by providing more specific examples or references from the Gospels. For instance, the student could have discussed the significance of the disciples' names in relation to Jesus' teachings or ministry.\n\nOverall, while this response demonstrates a general awareness of the biblical texts, it falls short of fully showcasing the student's understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings."
