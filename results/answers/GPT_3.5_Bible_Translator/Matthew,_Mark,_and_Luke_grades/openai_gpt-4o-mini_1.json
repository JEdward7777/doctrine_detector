  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies where the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the Bible, demonstrating a good understanding of the Gospel accounts. However, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have included reference to the book of Acts where the list of the disciples is also found. Overall, a solid response with a minor oversight."
