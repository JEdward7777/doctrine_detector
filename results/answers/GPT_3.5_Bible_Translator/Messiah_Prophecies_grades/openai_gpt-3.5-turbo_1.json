It effectively connects these prophecies to Jesus as the Messiah. However, it could have been strengthened by referencing additional prophecies such as the suffering servant in Isaiah 53 or Jesus entering Jerusalem on a donkey in Zechariah 9:9 to further highlight the breadth of prophecies fulfilled by Jesus. Overall, the response effectively demonstrates how the fulfillment of prophecies strengthens faith in Jesus as the Messiah."
