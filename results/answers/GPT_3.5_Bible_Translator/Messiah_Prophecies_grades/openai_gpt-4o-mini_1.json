The examples given effectively support the assertion that fulfilled prophecies strengthen faith in Jesus as the promised Savior. The response could be strengthened by including more varied examples of fulfilled prophecies to showcase the depth and breadth of Old Testament prophecies pointing to Jesus as the Messiah. Overall, a solid response grounded in a Christian worldview."
