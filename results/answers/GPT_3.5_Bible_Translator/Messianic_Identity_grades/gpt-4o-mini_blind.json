It effectively ties in the Old Testament prophecies, the recognition of Jesus as the Son of David, and the establishment of a spiritual kingdom through his sacrificial death and resurrection. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the doctrinal elements and articulates them well. However, a bit more emphasis on the uniqueness of Jesus as the only way to salvation could further enhance the response."
