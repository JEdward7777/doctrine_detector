The writer also correctly notes that Jesus' reign is eternal.\n\nHowever, to fully address the concern about understanding Jesus' messianic role, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical prophecies fulfilled by Jesus and emphasized the significance of his sacrificial death and resurrection in establishing his kingdom.

Additionally, they could have explored how Jesus' messianic role is crucial for Christian theology and practice."
