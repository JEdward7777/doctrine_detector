  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of what it means to 'minister' to others according to the Bible. They correctly emphasize the importance of serving, caring, and supporting others in the name of God, reflecting Jesus' example of humble and sacrificial love. The inclusion of various ways in which ministering can manifest itself, as well as referencing relevant biblical passages, adds depth to the response. However, the student could have further emphasized the centrality of the Gospel message in ministering to others, as well as the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for this ministry."
