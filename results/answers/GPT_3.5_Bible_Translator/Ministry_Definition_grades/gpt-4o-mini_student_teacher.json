  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of what it means to 'minister' to others according to the Bible, covering aspects of serving, caring, supporting, and sharing God's love. The response effectively highlighted the importance of ministering in various forms, encompassing both spiritual and physical needs. The student's emphasis on reflecting God's love and pointing people towards Him aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the response could have been more succinct and directly aligned with the teacher's reference answer, specifically in emphasizing teaching about God and caring for spiritual and physical needs as core elements of ministry."
