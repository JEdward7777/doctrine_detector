It effectively connects ministering to both spiritual and physical needs, highlighting the comprehensive nature of serving in God's kingdom. The integration of relevant biblical passages further strengthens the explanation. The response could have explicitly mentioned the role of sharing God's grace and truth in ministering, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern with a clear and insightful perspective from a Christian worldview."
