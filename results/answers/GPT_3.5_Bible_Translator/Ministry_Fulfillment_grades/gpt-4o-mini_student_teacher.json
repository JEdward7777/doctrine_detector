  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and detailed explanation of fulfilling one's ministry as a Christian. They correctly highlighted the importance of faithfully carrying out God's calling and serving others. The student's answer aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing obedience, perseverance, and bringing glory to God. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the specific concern of understanding and executing one's God-given purpose in serving others, as outlined in the reference answer from the teacher."
