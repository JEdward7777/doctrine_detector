  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth from a Christian perspective. The student effectively connects the historical uses of myrrh to its symbolic representation of Jesus' future sacrifice and death. The mention of Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb of God further strengthens the theological depth of the answer. Well done."
