Myrrh was a valuable substance that was often used for its fragrance and for its healing properties in ancient times. In the context of the gifts presented to Jesus at his birth, myrrh symbolizes his future sacrifice and death. Just as myrrh was used in the preparation of bodies for burial, the gift of myrrh to Jesus foreshadowed his ultimate purpose on earth - to die for the redemption of humanity. It serves as a reminder of the deep significance of Jesus' incarnation, highlighting his dual role as both the long-awaited Messiah and the sacrificial Lamb of God.
