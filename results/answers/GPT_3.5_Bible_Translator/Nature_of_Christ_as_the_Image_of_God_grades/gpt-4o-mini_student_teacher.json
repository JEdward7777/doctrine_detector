  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that touches on various facets of Jesus being the image of God in Christian belief. They accurately highlighted Jesus' dual nature as fully God and fully human, as well as the significance of this concept in revealing God's character and plan for salvation. The student effectively connected the theological understanding of Christ's nature to the implications for believers in following His example and experiencing God's presence. However, the student's response could benefit from emphasizing Jesus as sharing the same essence with God the Father more explicitly to align closer with the teacher's reference answer."
