  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and comprehensive definition of eternity from a Christian perspective. It clearly contrasts eternity with earthly existence, explains its connection to salvation through Jesus Christ, and highlights the consequences of faithfulness and rejection. The inclusion of references to the immortality of the soul and resurrection adds depth to the explanation."
