  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the importance of exhortation in a loving and supportive manner, citing biblical passages to support the argument. It emphasizes the key aspects of speaking the truth in love and exhorting with humility, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the concern by explicitly stating the importance of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner, rather than indirectly covering it within the broader context of exhortation. Overall, a very strong and insightful response."
