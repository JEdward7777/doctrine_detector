  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of Jesus's teaching on forgiveness and its reflection on the character of God the Father. They correctly highlight the emphasis on forgiveness, the reciprocal nature of forgiveness in our relationship with God, God's unconditional love illustrated in the parable of the prodigal son, and the infinite capacity for forgiveness demonstrated in Matthew 18:21-22. The student could have further emphasized the justice and holiness of God in conjunction with His mercy and forgiveness to provide a more complete understanding of God's character. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references to support their points would strengthen the answer."
