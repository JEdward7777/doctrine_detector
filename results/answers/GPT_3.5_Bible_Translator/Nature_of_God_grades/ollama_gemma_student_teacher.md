3. Intimacy and connection: Understanding God as spirit enables us to connect with Him on a deeper level, beyond physical limitations, fostering a more intimate and personal relationship with Him.

4. Authenticity: Our worship should be sincere and heartfelt, coming from the depths of our spirits, as we commune with the Spirit of God in worship.

Overall, the understanding that God is a spirit should guide us to worship Him in spirit and truth, engaging our hearts, minds, and spirits in genuine adoration and praise.
