It effectively addresses the concern by discussing reverence, spiritual focus, intimacy, connection, authenticity, and engaging with God in spirit and truth. The only minor suggestion would be to incorporate more references to Scripture to strengthen the biblical foundation of the points made. Overall, a strong and deeply thoughtful response."
