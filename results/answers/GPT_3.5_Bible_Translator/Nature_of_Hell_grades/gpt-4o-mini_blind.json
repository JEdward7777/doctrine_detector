  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of what the Bible says about the nature and experience of hell. It accurately presents hell as a place of eternal punishment and separation from God for those who reject Him. The inclusion of key Bible verses such as Matthew 25:41 and Revelation 20:10 adds credibility to the answer. The explanation of God's desire for all to be saved is also well-stated. However, to improve the grade, the student could further emphasize the aspect of repentance and the need for a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as the means of salvation from hell. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview and the foundational doctrines of sin, judgment, and redemption would enhance the overall response."
