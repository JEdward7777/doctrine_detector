  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid overview of what the Bible says about the nature of hell and its consequences for those who reject God. They appropriately emphasized the eternal punishment and separation from God that hell entails. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses adds depth to the explanation. However, the student could have further elaborated on the severity and purpose of hell in relation to Christian views of judgment and salvation to fully address the given concern."
