In the Bible, manna is described as a type of bread-like food that God provided for the Israelites during their time in the wilderness. The appearance of manna is described as being like coriander seed and its color like bdellium resin (Exodus 16:31). The taste of manna is said to be like wafers made with honey (Exodus 16:31). People gathered it every morning and used it as their primary source of sustenance while journeying in the desert. It was seen as a miraculous provision from God to meet their physical needs.
