  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of explaining the significance of Jesus' miracles in affirming His divine nature as God and the Messiah. The writer provides specific examples of the miracles mentioned in the New Testament, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, calming storms, and feeding large crowds with a small amount of food. They also effectively demonstrate how these miracles point to Jesus' authority as the promised Savior who has come to bring salvation to all who believe in Him.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give this response a perfect score is that it doesn't explicitly state that Jesus' miracles serve as evidence of His divinity, which is mentioned in the concern. However, the writer does effectively convey this idea through their examples and explanation of the significance of the miracles.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of Jesus' miracles in affirming His divine nature as God and the Messiah.
