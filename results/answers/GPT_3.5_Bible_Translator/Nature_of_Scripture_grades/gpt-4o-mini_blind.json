They correctly distinguish between the two terms and explain their significance within Christianity. However, it could be improved by emphasizing more explicitly the divine authority and inspiration of Scripture as the ultimate Word of God, alongside the revelation of God's message through Jesus Christ. Additionally, a clearer connection between the written and spoken Word of God would strengthen the answer."
