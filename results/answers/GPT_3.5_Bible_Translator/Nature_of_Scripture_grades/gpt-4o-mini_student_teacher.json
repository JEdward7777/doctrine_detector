  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful explanation of the relationship between \"scripture\" and \"the word of God\" in the biblical context. They correctly identified that scripture refers to the sacred texts of the Christian faith, while the word of God can have a broader meaning encompassing both written and spoken messages from God. The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but could have been strengthened by further emphasizing the primary focus on the Hebrew scriptures as God's written messages, as highlighted in the reference answer."
