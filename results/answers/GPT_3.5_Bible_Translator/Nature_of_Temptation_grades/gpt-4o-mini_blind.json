The student effectively incorporates biblical references, such as the fall of humanity and 1 John 2:16, to support their points. The emphasis on the importance of relying on the power of the Holy Spirit, prayer, and the Word of God for resisting temptation is commendable. Overall, this answer demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian theology on temptation. Great job!"
