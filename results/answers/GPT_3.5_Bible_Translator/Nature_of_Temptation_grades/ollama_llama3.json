  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe student's response provides some good insights into the nature of temptation, acknowledging both the role of our sinful nature and external influences in leading us astray. They correctly identify that our sinful nature drives us to desire what is wrong, and that external factors can entice us to sin. The reference to Satan as an external influence is also a positive aspect.\n\nHowever, I would have liked to see more depth and nuance in the response. For example, the student could have expanded on the concept of our sinful nature being inherited from Adam's fall, or provided more specific examples of how external influences can lead us into temptation. Additionally, while the student mentions that we need to rely on the power of the Holy Spirit, prayer, and the Word of God to resist temptation, this is not explicitly linked back to the understanding of sources and reasons for temptation.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a basic understanding of the biblical teaching on temptation, but could benefit from more development and analysis."
