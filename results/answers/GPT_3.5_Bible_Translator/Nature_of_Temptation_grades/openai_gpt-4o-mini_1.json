The inclusion of biblical references and the emphasis on relying on the Holy Spirit, prayer, and the Word of God for resisting temptation align well with Christian beliefs. A minor improvement could be adding further explanation or examples to illustrate how our sinful nature and external influences interact to lead us into temptation."
