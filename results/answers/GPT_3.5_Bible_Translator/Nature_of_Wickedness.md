## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible provides several examples and descriptions of individuals who are considered wicked in their actions. Some common characteristics of wicked individuals mentioned in the Bible include:

1. Those who oppress the weak and vulnerable: Proverbs 14:31 says, "Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God."

2. Those who lie and deceive: Proverbs 12:22 states, "The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy."

3. Those who are proud and arrogant: Proverbs 16:5 warns, "The Lord detests all the proud of heart. Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished."

4. Those who engage in injustice and corruption: Proverbs 15:27 cautions, "The greedy bring ruin to their households, but the one who hates bribes will live."

Regarding the state of such individuals, the Bible teaches that there are consequences for wickedness. Psalm 37:1-2 says, "Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong; for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away."

Ultimately, the Bible proclaims that God is just and will judge all individuals according to their actions. In Romans 2:6-8, it says, "God 'will repay each person according to what they have done.' To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger."

Therefore, the Bible encourages individuals to turn away from wickedness, repent, and seek God's forgiveness and transformation through Jesus Christ in order to experience salvation and eternal life.
