  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a generally accurate explanation of the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' as presented in the Bible. They correctly identify the general understanding of the soul as the inner life of a person and the spirit as the immaterial, eternal aspect connected to God. The explanation is clear and references the original Hebrew and Greek terms. However, the response could be improved by emphasizing that the soul and spirit are not always used interchangeably in the Bible and by highlighting the biblical basis for the distinctions. Additionally, the student could delve deeper into the theological implications of these concepts within Christian doctrine."
