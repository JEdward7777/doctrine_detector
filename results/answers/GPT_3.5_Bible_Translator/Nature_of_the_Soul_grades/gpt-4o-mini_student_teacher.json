  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful explanation of the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible, highlighting their general meanings and roles. However, the student's answer falls short of the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes the potential interchangeability of the terms in the biblical context. While the student's answer is insightful and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, it does not fully align with the specific concern of accurate interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God."
