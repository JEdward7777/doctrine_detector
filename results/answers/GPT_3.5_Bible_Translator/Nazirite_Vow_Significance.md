In Numbers 6:1-4, the Nazirite vow is a voluntary vow of dedication to the Lord, typically for a temporary period of time. The key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow include:

1. Abstaining from wine and other fermented drinks – This restriction symbolizes separation from worldly pleasures and is seen as a sign of devotion to God.

2. Avoiding contact with anything unclean – This includes avoiding contact with dead bodies, which was symbolic of maintaining spiritual purity and consecration to the Lord.

3. Allowing the hair to grow long – The Nazirite was to refrain from cutting their hair during the period of the vow as a visible sign of their consecration to God.
