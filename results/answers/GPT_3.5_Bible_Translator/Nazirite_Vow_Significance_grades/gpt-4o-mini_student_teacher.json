  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70/100.\n\nWhile the student provided a well-explained answer with accurate information on the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow, they missed the crucial detail of abstaining from food or drink made from grapes as specified in the reference answer. It's important to accurately represent all the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow from a biblical perspective. The explanation provided by the student regarding the symbolism and significance of the restrictions aligns well with the biblical context, which is commendable."
