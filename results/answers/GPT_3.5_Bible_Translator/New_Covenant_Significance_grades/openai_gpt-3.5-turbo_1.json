It emphasizes the significance of the new covenant in bringing complete atonement for sins through Jesus' sacrifice, contrasting it effectively with the temporary nature of the old covenant sacrifices. The response appropriately highlights the centrality of Jesus in the new covenant and the fulfillment of God's promises through His sacrificial death."
