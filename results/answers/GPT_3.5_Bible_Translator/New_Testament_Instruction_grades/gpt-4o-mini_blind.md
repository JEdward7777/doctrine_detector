## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, Christians are instructed to use the Psalms for worship, teaching, and encouragement. The apostle Paul, for example, urges believers to use Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to worship and edify one another (Ephesians 5:19, Colossians 3:16). Jesus himself quoted from the Psalms on several occasions, demonstrating their enduring relevance for believers (e.g., Matthew 27:46; Luke 24:44).

Additionally, the Psalms are often referenced in the New Testament as prophetic texts that point to the person and work of Jesus Christ. For example, Psalm 22 is seen as a messianic psalm describing the suffering of Christ on the cross, while Psalm 110 is cited as a prophecy of Christ's exaltation and reign as king.

Overall, the Psalms are valued by Christians as a rich source of inspiration, comfort, and encouragement in their personal relationship with God and in their corporate worship as a community of believers.
