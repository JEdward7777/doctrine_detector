  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that covers various aspects of the Psalms' significance in the New Testament, including their use in worship, teaching, and their prophetic nature regarding Jesus Christ. However, the student's answer goes beyond the specified concern of how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship, which focused specifically on singing psalms to God. The response could have been improved by directly addressing the specified concern in a more concise manner."
