## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, believers in Jesus are considered priests in the sense that they have direct access to God through Jesus Christ. In the Old Testament, only certain individuals, such as the Levitical priests, had the authority to approach God on behalf of the people. However, with the coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate high priest, believers now have direct access to God. This concept is highlighted in passages such as 1 Peter 2:9, which describes believers as a "royal priesthood" and a "holy nation," called to declare the praises of God.

As priests, believers are able to offer spiritual sacrifices, such as prayer, worship, and acts of service, to God. They can intercede on behalf of others and share the good news of Jesus with those around them. This priesthood of all believers emphasizes the intimate relationship that each believer can have with God and the call to serve Him faithfully in all aspects of life.
