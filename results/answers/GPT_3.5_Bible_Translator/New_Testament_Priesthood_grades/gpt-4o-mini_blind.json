The reference to 1 Peter 2:9 is apt and supports the explanation. The mention of offering spiritual sacrifices, interceding for others, and sharing the gospel aligns well with the biblical understanding of priesthood in the Christian faith. Overall, this response effectively conveys the doctrinal significance of believers being priests in the New Testament."
