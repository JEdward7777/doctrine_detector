  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a strong understanding of the concept of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament, emphasizing believers' direct access to God through Jesus Christ and their ability to offer spiritual sacrifices and intercede for others. The student effectively incorporates relevant biblical references such as 1 Peter 2:9 to support their explanation. However, the student's answer is slightly longer and includes more elaboration than the reference answer, which could be seen as adding some unnecessary complexity. Overall, the student demonstrates a good grasp of the topic but could streamline their explanation for more clarity."
