  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament. It effectively contrasts the Old Testament priesthood system with the new reality in Christ and highlights the direct access believers have to God through him. The reference to 1 Peter 2:9 reinforces the idea of believers as a royal priesthood. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the practical implications of the priesthood of all believers in the everyday lives of believers."
