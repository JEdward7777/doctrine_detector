  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the concept of the priesthood of all believers by emphasizing believers' direct access to God through Jesus Christ, the ability to offer spiritual sacrifices, intercede for others, and share the good news of Jesus. It references relevant biblical passages and highlights the shift from the Old Testament priesthood to the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament. The explanation is clear, coherent, and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
