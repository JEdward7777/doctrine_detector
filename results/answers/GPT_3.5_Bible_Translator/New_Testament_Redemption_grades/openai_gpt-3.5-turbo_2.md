## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Old Testament, purification was often carried out through ritual practices involving sacrifices, offerings, and washings. These practices were meant to cleanse individuals or objects from sin or impurity so that they could be considered clean and acceptable before God. The focus in the Old Testament was on external rituals and observances as a means of achieving purification.

In the New Testament, the concept of purification undergoes a significant transformation. With the coming of Jesus Christ and his sacrifice on the cross, a new understanding of purification is introduced. In the New Testament, purification is more concerned with the internal state of the heart and the transformation of the individual through faith in Christ.

The apostle Paul, for example, emphasizes the idea of being purified through faith in Christ and being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul writes, "But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God" (1 Corinthians 6:11).

In the New Testament, purification is not achieved through external rituals or works, but through the redemptive work of Christ and the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. Believers are purified and made clean through their faith in Jesus and their relationship with Him, rather than through adherence to external laws and rituals.

Ultimately, the concept of purification in the New Testament points to the spiritual cleansing and renewal that believers experience through their relationship with Christ, rather than through outward rituals and observances.
