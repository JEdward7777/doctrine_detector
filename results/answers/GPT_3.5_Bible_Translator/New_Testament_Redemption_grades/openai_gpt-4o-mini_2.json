It correctly highlights the shift from external rituals to faith in Jesus for purification. The incorporation of relevant biblical references, such as the verse from 1 Corinthians, supports the argument. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique and ultimate nature of Christ's sacrifice and its centrality in providing purification, particularly in contrast to the temporary nature of Old Testament sacrifices."
