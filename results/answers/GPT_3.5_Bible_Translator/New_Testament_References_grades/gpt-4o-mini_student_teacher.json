  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned answer that effectively connected aspects of John the Baptist's life with the principles of a Nazirite vow. The student demonstrated an understanding of biblical continuity between Old Testament practices and New Testament figures. However, the answer could have been strengthened by including the specific reference to John not drinking strong drink as suggested in the teacher's reference answer."
