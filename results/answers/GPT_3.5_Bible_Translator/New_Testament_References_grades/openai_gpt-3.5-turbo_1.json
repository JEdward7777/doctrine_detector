  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed analysis connecting John the Baptist's life and ministry with the principles of a Nazirite vow, demonstrating a good understanding of biblical continuity between the Old and New Testaments. It acknowledges the lack of explicit biblical evidence while presenting compelling arguments based on scriptural parallels. The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring how Old Testament practices may have influenced New Testament figures."
