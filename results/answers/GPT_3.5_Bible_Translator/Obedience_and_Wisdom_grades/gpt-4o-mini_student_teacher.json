  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful response, demonstrating a strong understanding of the connection between listening to God and gaining wisdom within the Christian faith. The answer effectively explains the importance of seeking God's guidance, aligning decisions with His will, and the scriptural basis for connecting obedience to God with wisdom. The student could further enhance their answer by explicitly addressing the concern about how recognizing this link can enhance one's spiritual journey, but overall, this is a well-developed and cohesive response."
