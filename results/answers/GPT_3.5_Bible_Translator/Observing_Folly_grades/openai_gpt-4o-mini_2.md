## [Answer](../Observing_Folly.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, folly is often associated with actions that reflect a lack of wisdom, understanding, or fear of the Lord. Some examples of actions that are categorized as folly include:

1. Mocking God or His servants (Proverbs 14:9)
2. Engaging in quarrels and disputes that lead to sin (Proverbs 20:3)
3. Trusting in one's own understanding rather than seeking God's wisdom (Proverbs 3:5-7)
4. Being quick to anger and not exercising self-control (Proverbs 14:16)
5. Pursuing wealth and material possessions at the expense of righteousness (Luke 12:15)
6. Rejecting God's truth and following false teachings (2 Timothy 4:3-4)

Ultimately, folly in the biblical sense is a failure to align one's actions and attitudes with God's wisdom and will. The Bible teaches that true wisdom comes from fearing the Lord, seeking His guidance, and following His commandments.
