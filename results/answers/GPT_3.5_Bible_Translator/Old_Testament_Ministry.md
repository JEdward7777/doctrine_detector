In the Old Testament, the priests were responsible for carrying out various ceremonies and rituals in the temple. They were descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, and were consecrated for service to God.

The priests' duties included offering sacrifices on the altar, such as burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings, to atone for the sins of the people. They were also responsible for teaching the people God's laws and ensuring that they were followed.

The priests followed strict guidelines for their service, including rules for purification and dress. They would enter the temple's holy areas to perform their duties, such as lighting the lamps, burning incense, and presenting the showbread.

Ultimately, the priests served as mediators between God and the people, seeking to maintain the relationship between the Israelites and their God through obedience to his commandments and offerings of sacrifice.
