  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 85.\n\nWhile the student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the priests' duties and responsibilities in the Old Testament, there is room for improvement in connecting these practices to inform current ministry approaches and sacrificial service. \n\nThe student adequately describes the priests' role in offering sacrifices, teaching God's laws, and serving as mediators, but they could have further emphasized the significance of sacrificial service in understanding the priestly ministry as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice for sin. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could have strengthened their answer by highlighting the spiritual significance and symbolic nature of the priests' ministry in the context of Christian beliefs."
