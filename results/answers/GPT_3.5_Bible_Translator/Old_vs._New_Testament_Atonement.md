## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Old Testament, atonement primarily involved the act of offering sacrifices to God as a way to reconcile with Him and receive forgiveness for sins. The sacrificial system was a central aspect of the Israelite religion, with specific instructions on various types of sacrifices for different offenses outlined in the Mosaic Law.

In contrast, the New Testament teaches that Jesus Christ serves as the ultimate and final atonement for the sins of humanity. Through His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus provided a way for all people to be reconciled with God and receive forgiveness of sins. This concept of atonement is based on grace and the belief that Jesus' sacrifice was sufficient to pay the penalty for all of humanity's sins, past, present, and future.

While the Old Testament sacrificial system provided temporary atonement for sins, the New Testament teaches that Jesus' sacrifice offers permanent and complete atonement for those who believe in Him. This shift from the temporary and symbolic sacrifices of the Old Testament to the once-for-all sacrifice of Jesus Christ in the New Testament highlights the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation and reconciliation with humanity.
