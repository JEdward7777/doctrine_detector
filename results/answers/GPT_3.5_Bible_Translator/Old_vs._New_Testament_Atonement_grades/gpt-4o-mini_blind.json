The student accurately identifies the key differences, such as the temporary nature of Old Testament sacrifices versus the permanent atonement through Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The explanation is clear and highlights the pivotal role of Jesus' sacrifice in providing ultimate reconciliation with God. Well done!"
