  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of both the Old Testament concept of atonement through sacrifices and the New Testament understanding that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for all sins. The writer effectively highlights the shift from temporary to permanent atonement, noting that the Old Testament sacrificial system was symbolic and temporary, whereas Jesus' sacrifice is once-for-all and provides complete forgiveness.\n\nThe response also demonstrates an understanding of the fulfillment of God's plan in biblical history, as it notes that Jesus' sacrifice \"highlights the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation and reconciliation with humanity.\" This shows a good grasp of the concern to clarify the transition from temporary to permanent atonement.\n\nHowever, there is some room for improvement. The response could be more concise and focused, eliminating unnecessary phrases and sentences. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples or illustrations to support the writer's claims and make the concepts more concrete for readers.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history."
