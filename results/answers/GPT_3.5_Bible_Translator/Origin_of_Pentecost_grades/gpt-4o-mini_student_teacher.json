  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the historical and religious significance of the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) before the events described in the New Testament. They accurately describe the agricultural and religious aspects of the festival in Jewish tradition. However, the student could have further emphasized the connection of the festival to its fulfillment in Christ, as outlined in the concern. By integrating how Pentecost foreshadowed the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the Christian church in Acts 2, the response could have been strengthened from a Christian worldview perspective."
