It effectively connects the biblical festival to its fulfillment in Christ by highlighting the parallel between the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2. The response could further emphasize how Pentecost represents the fulfillment of the Old Testament feast in the birth of the Christian church, but overall, it effectively demonstrates the connection between the festival and its fulfillment in Christ."
