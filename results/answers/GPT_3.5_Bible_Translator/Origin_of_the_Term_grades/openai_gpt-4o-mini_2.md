The followers of Jesus Christ were first called "Christians" in the city of Antioch (Acts 11:26). This term was used to distinguish them as followers of Christ, the Messiah, and it is likely that it was initially used by non-believers as a way to identify this growing movement. The name "Christian" signifies that these individuals were closely associated with Christ and sought to live according to his teachings.
