  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively explains the relationship between the concept of pardon and God's forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ. They provide a clear explanation of how the act of pardon in human terms correlates to God's forgiveness in Christianity. The student also supports their points with relevant biblical references and highlights the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in obtaining pardon for humanity. However, the teacher's reference answer offers a more concise and direct explanation of the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness, which could have been reflected more clearly in the student's response."
