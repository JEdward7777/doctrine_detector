They clearly articulated how Jesus fulfills the symbolism of the Passover lamb through his sacrificial death and resurrection, emphasizing the redemption and freedom believers receive through Him. The response effectively connects the Old Testament foreshadowing of the Passover with the New Testament fulfillment in Jesus Christ. Great job overall!"
