  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the connection between the Old Testament Passover and Jesus in the New Testament. They effectively highlighted how Jesus is understood as the ultimate Passover lamb whose sacrificial death brings deliverance from sin and spiritual slavery. The student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological significance of Passover for Christians in relation to Jesus. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused solely on the representation of Jesus as the Passover Lamb to align more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
