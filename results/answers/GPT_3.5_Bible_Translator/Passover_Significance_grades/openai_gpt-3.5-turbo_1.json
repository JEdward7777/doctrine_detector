It clearly articulates how Jesus fulfills the symbolism of the Passover lamb through His sacrificial death and resurrection, offering redemption and salvation for believers. The theological significance is well-presented and demonstrates a strong understanding of the relationship between the Passover and Jesus in Christian belief. Great job!"
