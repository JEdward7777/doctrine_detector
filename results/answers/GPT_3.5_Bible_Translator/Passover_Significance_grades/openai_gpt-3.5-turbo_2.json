It demonstrates a clear understanding of how the themes of deliverance, sacrifice, and redemption in the Passover ceremony foreshadow and are fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ. The theological significance of Jesus as the perfect sacrificial lamb for Christians is articulated well in the response."
