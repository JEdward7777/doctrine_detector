## [Answer](../Peace_with_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Faith in Jesus' sacrifice plays a central role in achieving peace with God according to Scripture. In the New Testament, particularly in the letters of Paul, the concept of justification by faith is emphasized. This means that through faith in Jesus Christ and His sacrificial death on the cross, believers are justified in the eyes of God and reconciled to Him.

Romans 5:1-2 says, "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through Him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God."

Ephesians 2:8-9 further explains, "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."

In essence, faith in Jesus' sacrifice is the means by which we receive the forgiveness of our sins, are justified before God, and can experience true peace with Him. It is through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross that the barrier of sin separating us from God is removed, and we are reconciled to Him.
