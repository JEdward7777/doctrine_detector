  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses impacted their relationship with Jesus and early Christians. The answer effectively highlights the contrast between legalistic observance and genuine faith emphasized by Jesus, leading to conflicts. The student's response is well-structured, demonstrating a clear understanding of the dynamics at play. The only minor improvement could be to directly mention the importance of the spirit of the law, in line with the teacher's reference answer."
