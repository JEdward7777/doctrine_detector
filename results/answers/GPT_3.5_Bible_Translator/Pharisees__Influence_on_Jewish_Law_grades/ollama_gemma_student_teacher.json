  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the conflict between the Pharisees and Jesus, as well as the tension between the Pharisees and early Christians. The student clearly articulates the Pharisees' emphasis on legalistic observance rather than genuine faith and the contrast between their understanding of righteousness and Jesus' emphasis on grace and mercy. The response also acknowledges the opposition faced by early Christians from the Pharisees, highlighting the clash between their beliefs and practices. Overall, the answer is well-written and thoughtfully articulated, earning a high grade."
