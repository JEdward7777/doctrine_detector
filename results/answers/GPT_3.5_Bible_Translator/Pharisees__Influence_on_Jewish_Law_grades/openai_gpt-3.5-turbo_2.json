It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how the Pharisees' focus on legalistic observance created conflicts with Jesus, who emphasized the importance of genuine faith and righteousness. The explanation is clear, coherent, and aligns well with a Christian worldview, highlighting the spiritual principles Jesus taught that were at odds with the Pharisees' approach. Well done!"
