## [Answer](../Pharisees__Influence_on_Jewish_Law.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses played a significant role in their relationship with Jesus and early Christians. While the Pharisees were devoted to upholding the Mosaic Law and traditions, they often focused more on outward appearances and legalistic observance rather than on matters of the heart and true righteousness. 

Jesus challenged the Pharisees' legalistic approach and emphasized the importance of genuine faith, mercy, and love for God and others. This led to conflicts between Jesus and the Pharisees, as Jesus's teachings often contradicted their interpretations of the Law.

Similarly, early Christians faced opposition from the Pharisees, who viewed them as a threat to their religious authority and traditions. The early Christians' emphasis on grace, faith in Jesus Christ, and the freedom from the ceremonial aspects of the Law clashed with the Pharisees' strict adherence to traditional practices.

Overall, the Pharisees' rigid adherence to the Laws of Moses created a barrier between them and Jesus and early Christians, as they struggled to accept the new understanding of righteousness and salvation brought by Jesus.
