It effectively addresses the concern by illustrating the conflicts that arose due to the Pharisees' focus on legalistic observance rather than the true spirit of the law. The discussion on Jesus challenging the Pharisees' approach and the clash between early Christians and the Pharisees adds depth to the analysis. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the Pharisees' role and the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry."
