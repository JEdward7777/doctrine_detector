  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the term \"Son of God\" in Christian theology, emphasizing Jesus' divine nature and unique relationship with God. The answer effectively addresses the concern by clarifying that the term does not imply physical procreation but rather signifies a spiritual and theological truth. Additionally, the student correctly highlights the central importance of this concept in Christian faith. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to slightly condense the explanation to make it more concise and focused on the core teaching point."
