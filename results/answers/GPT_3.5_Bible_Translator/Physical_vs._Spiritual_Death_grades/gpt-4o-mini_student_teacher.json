  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' in a Christian worldview. They effectively articulated how physical death pertains to the separation of body and soul, while 'perish' carries a deeper spiritual connotation of eternal separation from God for those who do not accept Jesus. The student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer by emphasizing the eternal consequences of 'perish' in a spiritual context."
