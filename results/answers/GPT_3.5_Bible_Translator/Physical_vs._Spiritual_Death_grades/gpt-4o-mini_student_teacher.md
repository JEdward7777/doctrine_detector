## Question [Physical vs. Spiritual Death](../../../questions/Physical_vs._Spiritual_Death.md)
How should we differentiate between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish'?

## Correct Answer
While everyone will die physically, 'perish' in a spiritual context highlights eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus, and should be expressed as such in translation.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding.

## [Answer](../Physical_vs._Spiritual_Death.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Christian theological context, physical death refers to the cessation of physical life or the separation of the soul from the body. This is a natural part of human existence due to the consequences of sin in the world (Romans 6:23).

On the other hand, the spiritual meaning of "perish" often refers to the eternal separation from God and the consequences of sin, which is ultimately spiritual death or separation from God. This concept is found in verses like John 3:16 where it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

Therefore, while physical death is a temporary separation of the body and soul, the spiritual meaning of perishing refers to the eternal separation from God for those who reject Him and His offer of salvation through Jesus Christ.
