  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response adequately addresses the concern by clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death, noting that while everyone will die physically, the spiritual meaning of \"perish\" refers to eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus. The use of biblical examples, such as Romans 6:23 and John 3:16, also helps to support this distinction.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more explicit language and examples that directly address the concern. For instance, the response could explicitly state that physical death is a temporary separation of the body and soul, whereas spiritual death refers to eternal separation from God. Additionally, the response could provide more specific examples of how this distinction affects our understanding of biblical teachings.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the distinction between physical and spiritual death, but could benefit from further clarification and expansion."
