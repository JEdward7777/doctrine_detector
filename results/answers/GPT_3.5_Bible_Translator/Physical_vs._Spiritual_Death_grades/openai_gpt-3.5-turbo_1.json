  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinction between physical death and spiritual death within a Christian theological framework. It effectively explains the consequences of sin and the significance of trusting in Jesus for eternal life. The only area for improvement would be to provide a bit more detail or elaboration on the theological implications of spiritual death for a higher score."
