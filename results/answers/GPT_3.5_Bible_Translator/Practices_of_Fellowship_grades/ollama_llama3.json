  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the various ways early Christians expressed their fellowship, including gathering for worship, sharing meals, sharing resources, mutual support and encouragement, and communal living. The answer provided is a good starting point, mentioning some key practices such as listening to teaching, praying together, sharing belongings, and eating meals together.\n\nThe concern about recognizing the practices of fellowship helping contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other is also well-addressed in the response, as it highlights the importance of these early Christian practices for building strong relationships among believers today.\n\nTo take this response to a higher grade (90-100), I would suggest that the author could have provided more specific examples or anecdotes from Scripture to illustrate each of these practices, and perhaps emphasized even more explicitly how these practices can be applied in contemporary Christian life. However, overall, the response provides a clear and concise overview of the ways early Christians expressed their fellowship, which is helpful for recognizing the value of these practices today."
