It emphasizes additional practices such as gathering for worship, sharing resources, mutual support, and communal living, reflecting a rich understanding of fellowship among early Christians. This broader perspective can indeed help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other by drawing valuable insights from these historical practices."
