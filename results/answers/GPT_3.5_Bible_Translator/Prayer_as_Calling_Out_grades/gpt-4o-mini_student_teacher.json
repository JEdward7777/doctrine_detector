  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful explanation of what it means to \"call out to the Lord\" in prayers, touching on various aspects like expressing needs, seeking guidance, and demonstrating trust in God. The answer also effectively references biblical examples to support their interpretation. However, there is slight deviation from the specific concern of emphasizing the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life, which could have been more explicitly highlighted throughout the response."
