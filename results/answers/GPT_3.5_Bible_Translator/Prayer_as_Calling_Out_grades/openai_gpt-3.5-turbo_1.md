# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
When we are instructed to "call out to the Lord" in our prayers, it means that we should come to God with our needs, desires, praises, and concerns openly and honestly. This phrase conveys the idea of turning to God in times of trouble, seeking His guidance and help, and expressing our dependence on Him. 

In the Bible, we see examples of people calling out to the Lord in prayer when they are in distress, such as David in the Psalms or the disciples in the storm at sea. Calling out to the Lord demonstrates our trust in His power and willingness to help us in our time of need.

It is important to remember that God hears our prayers and is attentive to our cries. When we call out to the Lord, we are expressing our faith in His ability to intervene in our lives and bring about His will. It is a powerful act of surrender and submission to God's authority and sovereignty.
