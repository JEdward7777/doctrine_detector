## [Answer](../Predestination_Meaning.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, the term 'predestine' refers to the belief that God has foreordained or predetermined certain events or outcomes, including the ultimate destiny of individuals. This concept is often connected to the broader theological doctrine of predestination, which holds that God has chosen certain individuals for salvation before the foundation of the world. This belief is based on passages in the Bible that speak of God's sovereignty and his foreknowledge of all things. However, it is important to note that there are differences of interpretation on this topic among different Christian denominations and traditions.
