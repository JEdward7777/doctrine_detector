They correctly point out the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the assurance of identity as God's children, and the privilege of sharing in Christ's inheritance. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the personal and intimate relationship with God through the privilege of calling him \"Abba, Father.\""
