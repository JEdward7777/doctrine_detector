In Romans 8:14-15, the apostle Paul speaks about the privileges that adopted children of God receive:

- They are led by the Spirit of God: As adopted children of God, believers are guided and directed by the Holy Spirit in their lives. The Spirit helps them discern God's will and empowers them to live according to it.

- They receive the Spirit of adoption: Through the work of the Holy Spirit, believers are welcomed into God's family as His adopted children. They are no longer slaves to fear but can now cry out to God as their loving Father.

- They receive the spirit of sons: Adopted children of God receive the full rights and privileges of being God's children. They are heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, sharing in His glory and inheritance.

Overall, the privileges that adopted children of God receive include guidance and empowerment by the Holy Spirit, assurance of their identity as God's beloved children, and the promise of sharing in the blessings of sonship with Christ.
