  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nThe student correctly identifies the term \"Daughter of Zion\" as referring to the people of Israel in a prophetic context, touching on themes of hope, restoration, and salvation. They provide examples from both the Old and New Testaments to support their explanation, demonstrating an understanding of the term's usage in biblical prophecy. However, the response could be improved by delving deeper into the historical and cultural context of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" within the broader narrative of God's relationship with Israel. By focusing more on the specific nuances and implications of this title in its original setting, the student could enhance their analysis and application of the term in contemporary contexts. This deeper dive would help to better recognize the prophetic nature of the term and its significance in interpreting and applying scriptures today according to a Christian worldview."
