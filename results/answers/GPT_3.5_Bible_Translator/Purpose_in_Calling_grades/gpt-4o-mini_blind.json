The cited verses from Ephesians and Romans are relevant and support the guidance given. The emphasis on prayer, Scripture study, wise counsel, and aligning one's desires with God's truth is doctrinally sound and provides a solid foundation for understanding God's will in one's life. The only area for improvement would be to include a reminder of the importance of patience and perseverance in seeking God's will, as discerning one's calling can be a lifelong journey."
