  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful answer that aligns well with a Christian worldview. They incorporated relevant Bible verses and emphasized the importance of seeking God's will through prayer, Scripture, and wise counsel. The only slight deviation from the reference answer was the additional emphasis on the importance of obedience and the potential for trial and error in discerning one's calling, which adds depth to their response. Overall, a solid and well-rounded perspective."
