They addressed how exhortation in the New Testament involves encouraging believers to live out their faith obediently, pursue holiness, love one another, and please God. The references to Hebrews and Romans support their points effectively. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the aspect of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, as highlighted in the reference answer."
