  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 70.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges that exhortation is a key aspect of New Testament teaching, it falls short in its understanding of the primary purpose of exhortation. The answer provided primarily focuses on persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, whereas the given response highlights the importance of encouraging believers to live out their faith in obedience to God's Word.\n\nThe concern is about understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, which the given response meets more accurately. The example from Hebrews and Romans emphasizes the idea that exhortation is meant to build up and strengthen the body of Christ, rather than simply persuading individuals to avoid sin.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be beneficial to provide more biblical evidence supporting the idea that the primary purpose of exhortation is to encourage believers to live out their faith in obedience to God's Word."
