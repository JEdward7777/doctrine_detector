## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, exhortation is primarily meant to encourage, challenge, and admonish believers to live out their faith in obedience to God's Word. The apostles and early church leaders frequently exhorted believers to remain steadfast in their faith, to pursue holiness, to love one another, and to live in a manner that is pleasing to God.

The book of Hebrews, for example, is filled with exhortations to persevere in the faith, to hold fast to the hope we profess, and to encourage one another in love and good deeds (Hebrews 10:23-25). In Romans, Paul exhorts believers to present their bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, as an act of spiritual worship (Romans 12:1).

Overall, the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to build up and strengthen the body of Christ, to spur believers on towards maturity and godliness, and to equip them to fulfill God's purposes in their lives.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 70.

While the response acknowledges that exhortation is a key aspect of New Testament teaching, it falls short in its understanding of the primary purpose of exhortation. The answer provided primarily focuses on persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, whereas the given response highlights the importance of encouraging believers to live out their faith in obedience to God's Word.

The concern is about understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, which the given response meets more accurately. The example from Hebrews and Romans emphasizes the idea that exhortation is meant to build up and strengthen the body of Christ, rather than simply persuading individuals to avoid sin.

To improve this response, it would be beneficial to provide more biblical evidence supporting the idea that the primary purpose of exhortation is to encourage believers to live out their faith in obedience to God's Word.
