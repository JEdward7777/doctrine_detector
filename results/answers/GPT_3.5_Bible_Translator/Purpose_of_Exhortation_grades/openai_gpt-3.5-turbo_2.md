## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, exhortation is primarily meant to encourage, challenge, and admonish believers to live out their faith in obedience to God's Word. The apostles and early church leaders frequently exhorted believers to remain steadfast in their faith, to pursue holiness, to love one another, and to live in a manner that is pleasing to God.

The book of Hebrews, for example, is filled with exhortations to persevere in the faith, to hold fast to the hope we profess, and to encourage one another in love and good deeds (Hebrews 10:23-25). In Romans, Paul exhorts believers to present their bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, as an act of spiritual worship (Romans 12:1).

Overall, the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to build up and strengthen the body of Christ, to spur believers on towards maturity and godliness, and to equip them to fulfill God's purposes in their lives.
