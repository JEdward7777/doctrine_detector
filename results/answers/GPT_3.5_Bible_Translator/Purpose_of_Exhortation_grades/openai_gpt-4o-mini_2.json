The student effectively explains how exhortation is meant to encourage, challenge, and admonish believers to live out their faith in obedience to God's Word, drawing upon key passages such as Hebrews 10:23-25 and Romans 12:1 to support their points. The response accurately reflects the Christian worldview on the purpose of exhortation within the context of faith and Christian living."
