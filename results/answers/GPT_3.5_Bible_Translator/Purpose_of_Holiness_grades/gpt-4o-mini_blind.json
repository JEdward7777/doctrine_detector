  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response on how Christians are expected to live a holy and set apart life according to God's Word. The answer correctly emphasizes the importance of imitating Christ, growing in faith, avoiding sin, pursuing righteousness, and sharing the Gospel. However, it would have been even stronger if the answer had incorporated more references to specific biblical passages that support these points. Additionally, the student could have highlighted the significance of prayer and reliance on the Holy Spirit in living a holy life. Overall, a solid response with room for minor improvement."
