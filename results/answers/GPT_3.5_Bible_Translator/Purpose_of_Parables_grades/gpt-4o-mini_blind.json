It correctly identifies that parables are used to convey spiritual truths in a relatable manner and highlights how they challenge listeners to think critically and reflect on the message. The reference to concealing truths from some while revealing them to others aligns well with the biblical account in Matthew. This response could be further enhanced by emphasizing that parables also served as a fulfillment of prophecy (Psalm 78:2) and a way for Jesus to teach about the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 13:11)."
