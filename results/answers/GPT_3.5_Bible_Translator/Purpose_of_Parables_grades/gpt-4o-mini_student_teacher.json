  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 70.\n\nWhile the student accurately described the purpose of Jesus using parables to convey spiritual truths in a relatable manner and engaging his audience, there is a concern with the theological implications based on a Christian specific worldview. The student mentioned that parables were also used to conceal truths from those who were not genuinely seeking to understand, which may not fully align with the reference answer that states Jesus revealed truth to his disciples while hiding it from unbelievers. While the student did touch on this idea, it could have been addressed more explicitly to better reflect a Christian worldview. Overall, while the answer was well-written and demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, there could have been more emphasis on the exclusivity of understanding for those who believed in Jesus."
