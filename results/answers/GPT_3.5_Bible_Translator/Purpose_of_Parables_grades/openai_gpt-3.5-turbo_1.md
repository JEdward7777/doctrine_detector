## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Parables.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings was to convey spiritual truths in a way that was easily understandable and relatable to his audience. Parables are short stories or illustrations that use familiar, everyday situations to teach deeper spiritual truths about God's kingdom and the principles of the Christian faith. By using parables, Jesus could reach a wide range of people with varying levels of understanding, as well as challenge his listeners to think critically and reflect on the message being presented. Parables also served as a way for Jesus to conceal certain truths from those who were not genuinely seeking to understand and follow him, while revealing deeper insights to those who were open and receptive to his teaching (Matthew 13:10-15). Ultimately, the use of parables allowed Jesus to communicate profound spiritual truths in a way that resonated with his audience and invited them to engage with the message on a personal level.
