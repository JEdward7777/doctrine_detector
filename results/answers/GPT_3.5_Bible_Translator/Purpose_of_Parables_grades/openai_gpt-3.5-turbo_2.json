The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing how Jesus utilized parables to both reveal truths to his disciples and conceal them from those who did not believe, as supported by biblical references. Additionally, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith, making it a well-rounded and well-supported explanation. Great job!"
