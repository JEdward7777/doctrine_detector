  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of why Jesus used parables in his teachings, emphasizing their purpose in conveying spiritual truths that are easily understandable and relatable. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective, referencing relevant Biblical passages to support the argument. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the aspect of concealing truth from those not genuinely seeking to understand, in alignment with Matthew 13:10-15, which was highlighted in the given answer."
