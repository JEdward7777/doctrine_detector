The understanding of the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith is well-addressed with references to concealing truth from some and revealing it to others based on their receptivity. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the deeper spiritual truths behind Jesus' use of parables. Great job!"
