  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 85.\n\nWhile the student's answer provides a thorough and insightful overview of the key purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible, it could be improved by focusing more on the specific purposes mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's response covers a broad range of purposes, which demonstrates a deep understanding of the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life. However, a more direct alignment with the reference answer would have strengthened the response. Overall, the student's answer is well-written, comprehensive, and demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic at hand."
