  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a strong answer that aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the ways in which tests and trials can strengthen faith, refine character, and draw believers closer to God. The response also touches on the idea of growth, repentance, and reliance on God's strength, supported by relevant scripture references. While the student's answer did not explicitly mention the aspect of exposing sin and turning away from it as highlighted in the reference answer, their insights on deepening the relationship with God and conforming believers into the image of Christ are valuable and reflective of a solid understanding of the purpose of tests allowed by God."
