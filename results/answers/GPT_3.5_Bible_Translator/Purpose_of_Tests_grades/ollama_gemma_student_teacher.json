The student correctly identifies various purposes for these experiences, including strengthening faith, refining character, and drawing closer to God. Additionally, the student provides relevant biblical references to support their claims. While the response does not explicitly address the concern regarding understanding the nature of tests, it implicitly addresses it by providing a theological framework for interpreting and navigating these experiences."
