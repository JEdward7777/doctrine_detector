  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the purpose of tests and trials from a Christian perspective, emphasizing not only the exposure of sin but also the strengthening of faith, character refinement, and drawing closer to God. The inclusion of scriptural references further supports the explanation. The only slight deduction is that while the response does touch on the believer's response to difficult circumstances, it could have elaborated more on how understanding the nature of tests specifically impacts a believer's response."
