They correctly point out that the title signifies respect for a teacher or spiritual leader within the Jewish tradition, and specifically highlight Jesus' role as a Rabbi. The inclusion of a reference to Matthew further strengthens the response. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the specific role and significance of rabbinic teaching within Christian theology."
