  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of explaining the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, particularly with regards to Jesus' use of the title \"Rabbi\". The writer correctly identifies the term \"Rabbi\" as referring to a Jewish religious teacher, and goes on to provide specific examples from the Gospel of Matthew. Additionally, the response provides insight into the implications of Jesus being referred to as \"Rabbi\", highlighting his authority to teach and interpret Scripture.\n\nThe only areas for improvement would be to further explore the significance of Jesus' use of this title, particularly in relation to the concern about understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. While the response provides some insight into this area, it could be strengthened by more explicit connections to the broader biblical narrative.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the term \"Rabbi\" and its significance in the New Testament, particularly with regards to Jesus' role as a teacher and spiritual guide. To take it to the next level, consider exploring how Jesus' use of this title relates to his broader teachings about God's Kingdom and the nature of authority."
