  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the term \"Rabbi\" in the context of Christian teaching, emphasizing Jesus' role as a respected teacher and leader. It highlights the recognition of Jesus as a Rabbi in the New Testament and the implications of this title for his teachings and guidance. The use of biblical references, particularly from the Gospel of Matthew, strengthens the response and demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of rabbinic teaching in the Christian worldview."
