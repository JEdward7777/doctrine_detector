  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a clear explanation of the term \"Rabbi\" within the Christian context, highlighting its significance in relation to Jesus as a respected teacher and spiritual leader. The student effectively connects the term to its Jewish origins and explains its importance in understanding Jesus' role in teaching and guiding his disciples. The only minor improvement could be further elaboration on specific instances from the New Testament where Jesus is addressed as \"Rabbi\" to enhance the analysis."
