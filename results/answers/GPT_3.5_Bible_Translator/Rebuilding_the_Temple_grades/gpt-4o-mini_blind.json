The reference to Matthew 24:2 and Ephesians 2:19-22 adds depth to the discussion from a Christian viewpoint. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the theological implications of the temple's destruction and rebuilding within Christian doctrine, specifically emphasizing the significance of Christ's sacrifice and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers."
