## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers based on the teachings he received directly from Jesus Christ. In 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, Paul recounts the instructions he received from the Lord regarding the observance of the Lord's Supper. Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper during the Last Supper with his disciples, instructing them to do it in remembrance of him.

Paul emphasized the importance of partaking in the Lord's Supper regularly as a way for believers to remember the sacrificial death of Christ on the cross, to proclaim his death until he comes again, and to participate in the spiritual communion with Christ and one another. It serves as a means of spiritual nourishment, fellowship, and unity within the body of Christ.

Overall, the Lord's Supper is a sacred practice that serves as a reminder of the love and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, strengthens believers' faith, and fosters communion with God and fellow believers in the Christian community.
