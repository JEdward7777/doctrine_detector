It also effectively connects this rejection to Christian beliefs, emphasizing the importance of recognizing Jesus as the Son of God and Savior. The inclusion of the implications for faith, humility, and obedience makes this response very strong in addressing the concern about authority, faith, and recognition of the Messiah from a Christian worldview."
