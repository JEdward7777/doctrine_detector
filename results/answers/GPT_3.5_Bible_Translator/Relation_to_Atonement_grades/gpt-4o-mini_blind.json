  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the relationship between \"propitiation\" and \"atonement\" in Christian theology. The student effectively distinguishes between the two terms and accurately describes how Jesus's sacrificial death relates to both concepts. The explanation is doctrinally sound and effectively conveys the significance of these concepts in understanding salvation and reconciliation with God. Great job overall."
