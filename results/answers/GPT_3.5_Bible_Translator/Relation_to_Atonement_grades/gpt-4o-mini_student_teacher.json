The explanation effectively distinguishes the nuances of each concept while emphasizing the centrality of Jesus Christ's sacrificial death in reconciling humanity to God. The student effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the differences and similarities between the two terms. Overall, a solid understanding and articulation of the theological concepts involved."
