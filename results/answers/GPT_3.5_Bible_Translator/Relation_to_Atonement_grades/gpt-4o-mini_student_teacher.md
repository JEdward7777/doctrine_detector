## [Answer](../Relation_to_Atonement.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "propitiation" and the term "atonement" are related concepts in Christian theology, particularly in the context of understanding how Jesus Christ's sacrificial death reconciles humanity to God.

In the Bible, the term "atonement" generally refers to the act of making amends or reconciliation for sin. It signifies the process by which a sinful individual is brought back into right relationship with God through the forgiveness of sins. This concept is central to the Biblical understanding of salvation, and in the Old Testament, it often involved the offering of sacrifices as a symbol of repentance and reliance on God's grace.

On the other hand, the term "propitiation" specifically highlights that Jesus's sacrificial death on the cross satisfied the wrath of God against sin. The idea is that Jesus, through his perfect sacrifice, appeased God's righteous anger and justice, thereby making it possible for sinful humans to be reconciled to God.

In summary, while both "atonement" and "propitiation" involve the idea of reconciliation and forgiveness of sins, "propitiation" emphasizes Jesus's sacrificial act as the means by which God's wrath is appeased, enabling believers to be justified before God.
