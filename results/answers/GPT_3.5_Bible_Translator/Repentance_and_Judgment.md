## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Christian Bible, we see a clear connection between repentance and the wrath of God. The Bible teaches that God's wrath is poured out on those who persist in sin and rebellion against Him, but He is also merciful and gracious to those who repent and turn to Him.

One significant passage that addresses this relationship is Romans 2:5-6, which states, "But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. God ‘will repay each person according to what they have done.’”

This passage underscores the importance of repentance as a response to God's offer of forgiveness and grace. Through genuine repentance, we acknowledge our sin, turn away from it, and turn to God for forgiveness. This act of repentance not only restores our relationship with God but also spares us from the wrath to come.

It is important to understand that God's wrath is not arbitrary or capricious but is a just response to sin and rebellion. However, His mercy and grace are always available to those who repent and seek His forgiveness. Repentance, therefore, is not only a means of escaping God's wrath but also a vital step in experiencing His love, forgiveness, and salvation.
