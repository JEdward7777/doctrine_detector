  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that accurately demonstrates the connection between repentance and the wrath of God in the Christian faith. They referenced relevant biblical passages and effectively conveyed the importance of repentance in relation to experiencing God's mercy and avoiding His judgment. The only slight deduction is for not directly using the specific phrase \"righteous penalty\" mentioned in the reference answer, but overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview."
