  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that clearly demonstrates a deep understanding of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God from a Christian perspective. The student provides a clear explanation of the connection between sin and God's wrath, and how repentance offers forgiveness and restoration. The reference to Romans 2:5-6 is appropriate and effectively supports the argument."
