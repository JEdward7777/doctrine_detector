Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately identifies Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, as recorded in Acts 1:23-26. The mention of Matthias being selected through prayer and casting lots is correct. However, the response could be improved by also noting the significance of this event in relation to fulfilling Jesus' command to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:18-20).
