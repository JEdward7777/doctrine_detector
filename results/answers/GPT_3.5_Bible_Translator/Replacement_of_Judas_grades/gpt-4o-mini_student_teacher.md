Grade: 80

Comment: The student accurately identified Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, in line with the reference answer. They also correctly mentioned that Matthias was chosen through prayer and casting lots. However, the student missed addressing the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. A stronger tie-in to the importance of maintaining the original number of apostles for the ongoing ministry leadership could have been included for a more complete response from a Christian worldview.
