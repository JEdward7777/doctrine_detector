  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension by mentioning Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. The mention of Acts, Chapter 1, verses 23-26 adds credibility and scriptural support to the statement. However, the response could be improved by explicitly highlighting how Matthias' selection continued the leadership and gospel-spreading ministry established by Jesus. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account and its relevance to the concern."
