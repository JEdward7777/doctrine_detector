  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, supported by biblical references. However, the student's answer delved into aspects such as lifestyle changes, repentance, and obedience, which are indeed important but not the direct requirements for salvation as specified in the reference answer. The core elements of repentance and belief in Jesus for salvation were present but slightly obscured by additional details."
