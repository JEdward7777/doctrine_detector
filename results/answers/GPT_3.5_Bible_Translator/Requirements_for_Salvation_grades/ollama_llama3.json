  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe student provides clear biblical support for their statement, citing Ephesians 2:8-9 and Acts 16:31 to emphasize that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ. They also correctly identify the importance of repentance and a changed heart in following Jesus. The response accurately conveys the message of salvation as a gift from God, received by faith in Jesus.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more nuance and depth to the discussion. For example, while the student mentions that true faith will result in a change of heart, they do not fully explore what this means practically or how it should manifest in daily life. Additionally, there is no explicit mention of the role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life.\n\nOverall, the response provides a strong foundation for understanding salvation and faith, but could benefit from further development and application to real-life situations."
