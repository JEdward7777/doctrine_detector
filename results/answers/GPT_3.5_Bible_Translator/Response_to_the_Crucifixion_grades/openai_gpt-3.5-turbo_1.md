## [Answer](../Response_to_the_Crucifixion.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Acts 2:23, Peter addresses the crowd on the day of Pentecost and says, "This man [Jesus] was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross." Peter is pointing out that the crowd played a role in the crucifixion of Jesus by handing Him over to be crucified, even though it was part of God's predetermined plan for Jesus to die for the sins of humanity.
