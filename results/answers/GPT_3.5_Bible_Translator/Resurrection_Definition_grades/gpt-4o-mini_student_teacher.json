  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"resurrection\" within a Christian context, emphasizing the significance of Jesus Christ's resurrection and its implications for believers. They accurately highlight the centrality of this event in Christian faith. However, the student could improve the clarity of their response by explicitly defining resurrection in a broader sense as the act of becoming alive again after having died, in alignment with the teacher's reference answer."
