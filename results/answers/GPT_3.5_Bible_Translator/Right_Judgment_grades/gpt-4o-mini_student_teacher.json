  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 95. The student effectively explains how Luke 6:37 informs the approach to judging others, highlighting the importance of mercy, forgiveness, and grace. They connect this message to the Christian call to mirror the love and forgiveness we have received from God. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview of promoting grace over judgment within Christian communities. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the scripture and its implications on interpersonal relationships. Great job!"
