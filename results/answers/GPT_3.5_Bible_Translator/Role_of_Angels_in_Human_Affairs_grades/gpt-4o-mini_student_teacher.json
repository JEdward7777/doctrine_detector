They included key roles such as messengers, worshipers, warriors, and protectors of God's people. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific actions of strengthening His people and communicating as if speaking for God, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the roles of angels in serving God."
