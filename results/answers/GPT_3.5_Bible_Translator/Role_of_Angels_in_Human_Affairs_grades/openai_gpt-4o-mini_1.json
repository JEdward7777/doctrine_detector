However, the response could have further elaborated on the roles of angels as worshipers of God and warriors for God, which are important aspects of their service as depicted in Scripture. Understanding the full scope of angelic roles can significantly impact how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives, as it emphasizes the spiritual support and protection that believers receive from these celestial beings."
