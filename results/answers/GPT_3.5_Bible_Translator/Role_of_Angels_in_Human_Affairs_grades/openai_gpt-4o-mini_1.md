According to the Bible, angels serve God in various ways:

2. Worshipers of God: Angels are described in the Bible as worshiping God continually, praising Him and giving Him glory (Revelation 5:11-12).

3. Warriors for God: Angels are also depicted as engaging in spiritual warfare against evil forces, as seen in the battle between the archangel Michael and the devil in Revelation 12:7.

4. Protectors and Guardians: Angels are described as ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation (Hebrews 1:14), indicating their role in protecting and watching over believers.
