These roles indeed impact how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives, as angels are seen as intermediaries between God and humanity. The only suggestion for improvement would be to elaborate more on the roles of angels in spiritual warfare and worship, as these aspects also play a significant role in how Christians understand the spiritual realm and divine intervention."
