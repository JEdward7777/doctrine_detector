  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response that addresses various aspects of the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers. The incorporation of specific examples and references to Scripture adds depth and credibility to the answer. The student effectively connects the apostles' actions to key principles such as sound doctrine, leading by example, building community, and equipping believers for ministry. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the teacher's reference answer, specifically highlighting how the apostles' emphasis on teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer contributed to the growth and unity of the early church. A stronger alignment with the reference answer would further enhance the coherence and relevance of the student's response."
