It emphasizes sound doctrine, leading by example, fostering community, and equipping believers for ministry, all of which are crucial in modeling a Christ-centered community. The response connects the actions of the apostles to modern-day Christian practices and challenges believers to emulate their commitment to teaching and fostering community. Great use of biblical references to support the points made."
