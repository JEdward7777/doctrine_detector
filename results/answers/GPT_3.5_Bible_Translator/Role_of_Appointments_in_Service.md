## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Christian faith, believers are called to fulfill various roles within the Church in accordance with their gifts and abilities. These roles are often referred to as spiritual gifts, which are given by the Holy Spirit for the edification of the body of Christ. 

In 1 Corinthians 12:4-7, the apostle Paul writes, "There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work. Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good."

Therefore, Christians are called to fulfill their roles in the Church by:

1. Identifying and developing their spiritual gifts: Christians are called to discern the gifts that the Holy Spirit has given them and develop them for the service of the Church.

2. Serving with humility and love: Christians are called to serve in their appointed roles with humility, putting the needs of others above their own and demonstrating Christ-like love in all they do.

3. Submitting to the authority of the Church: Christians are called to submit to the leadership and guidance of the Church, recognizing that these roles are appointed by God for the equipping and building up of the body of believers.

4. Striving for unity and harmony: Christians are called to work together in unity and harmony, recognizing that each member of the body has a unique role to play in advancing the kingdom of God.

Ultimately, Christians are called to fulfill their roles within the Church in a way that glorifies God, builds up the body of believers, and advances the mission of the Church to make disciples of all nations.
