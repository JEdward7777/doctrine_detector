  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively addresses the concern by discussing the responsibility of believers in their appointed tasks within the body of Christ. The response incorporates relevant Biblical references and provides practical ways in which Christians are called to fulfill their roles within the Church. The student's emphasis on identifying spiritual gifts, serving with humility and love, submitting to authority, and promoting unity align well with a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be to more directly tie the conclusion back to the core message of faithfully serving and advancing God's kingdom, as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and well-rounded response."
