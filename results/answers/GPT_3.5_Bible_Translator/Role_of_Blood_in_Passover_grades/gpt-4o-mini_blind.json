It correctly connects the Old Testament event with its fulfillment in Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb. The student effectively showcases the parallel between the Passover lamb's blood providing atonement and protection and Jesus's shedding of His blood for the redemption and salvation of humanity. Great job overall!"
