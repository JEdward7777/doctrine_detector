## [Answer](../Role_of_Blood_in_Passover.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The significance of the blood in the Passover event as described in the Bible can be found in Exodus 12. During the last plague in Egypt, God instructed the Israelites to sacrifice a lamb and smear its blood on the doorposts of their homes. The blood served as a sign for the angel of death to pass over those houses and spare the firstborn within.

Symbolically, the blood of the lamb was a representation of atonement and protection. It foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus Christ, often referred to as the "Lamb of God," would make for humanity's sins. Through His sacrificial death on the cross, His blood provides atonement for sin and grants protection from spiritual death.

In the New Testament, the connection between the Passover lamb and Jesus is made clear in 1 Corinthians 5:7, where Paul refers to Christ as our Passover lamb who has been sacrificed. The shedding of Jesus's blood fulfills the ultimate Passover sacrifice, offering redemption and salvation to all who believe in Him.
