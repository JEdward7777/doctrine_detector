The student demonstrates a clear understanding of how the Passover lamb foreshadowed Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb of God. The integration of biblical references and the theological connection between the Old and New Testaments is well articulated. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to elaborate further on how the shedding of Jesus's blood brings about atonement and redemption for believers."
