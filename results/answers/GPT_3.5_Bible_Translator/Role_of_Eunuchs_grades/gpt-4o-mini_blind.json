  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively incorporates biblical references and demonstrates an understanding of God's value for all individuals and His ability to use diverse circumstances for His purposes. The connection to the body of Christ and God's sovereignty is well articulated. The response could benefit from further elaboration on how the role of eunuchs specifically reflected God's plan for different individuals in society during ancient times. Overall, a solid interpretation from a Christian worldview."
