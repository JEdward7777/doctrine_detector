## [Answer](../Role_of_Jesus_as_Messiah.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of the kingdom is intrinsically linked to Jesus' role as the Messiah in Christian theology. In the Old Testament, the idea of the kingdom of God was central to Jewish messianic expectations. The Messiah was anticipated as a future king who would establish God's kingdom on earth, bringing peace, justice, and salvation to God's people.

When Jesus came, he proclaimed the kingdom of God as being at hand (Mark 1:15). He inaugurated God's kingdom through his life, death, and resurrection. Jesus' role as the Messiah was to fulfill the prophetic promises of the coming kingdom and to reign as the rightful King over all creation.

Through his teachings, miracles, and sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus demonstrated the nature and values of the kingdom of God - a kingdom characterized by love, mercy, forgiveness, and humility. Jesus' resurrection signified his victory over sin and death, and his ascension to the right hand of the Father established his authority as the exalted King of kings.

As Christians, we believe that Jesus will one day return to fully establish God's kingdom on earth, bringing ultimate justice and restoration. In the meantime, we are called to live as citizens of the kingdom, following Jesus' example and sharing the good news of salvation with others. The concept of the kingdom and Jesus' role as the Messiah are therefore inextricably connected in the Christian faith, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan for the world.
