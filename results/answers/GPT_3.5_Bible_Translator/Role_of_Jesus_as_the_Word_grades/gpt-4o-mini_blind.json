  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of how the title \"the Word of God\" ascribed to Jesus highlights his nature in Christianity. The student effectively incorporates scriptural references and theological insights to support their points. One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the salvific aspect of Jesus as the Word of God, highlighting His role in redemption and salvation for humanity. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
