## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Jewish religious leaders played a significant role in influencing the crucifixion of Jesus. They saw Jesus as a threat to their authority and teachings, as he challenged their traditional beliefs and practices. The Gospel accounts show that the religious leaders plotted against Jesus, accusing him of blasphemy and seeking to have him arrested.

The Jewish religious leaders manipulated the political situation during the time of Jesus by pressuring the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, to sentence Jesus to death. They accused Jesus of claiming to be the King of the Jews, which was perceived as a challenge to the authority of the Roman Empire.

Ultimately, it was Pilate who ordered the crucifixion of Jesus, but the Jewish religious leaders played a crucial role in bringing about this outcome. It is important to note, however, that not all Jewish people at the time agreed with the actions of the religious leaders, and many of Jesus' followers were themselves Jewish. The crucifixion of Jesus was ultimately part of God's plan for salvation, as Jesus willingly gave up his life to redeem humanity from sin.
