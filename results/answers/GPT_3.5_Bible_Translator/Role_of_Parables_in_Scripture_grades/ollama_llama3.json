  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, particularly in the story of King David's confrontation with Nathan. The writer effectively explains how Nathan used the parable to reveal the gravity of David's sin and lead him to repentance. The only area for improvement is that the response could provide more specific analysis of the parable itself, such as exploring its symbolism or cultural context. However, overall, the response shows a clear grasp of the concern and provides relevant biblical examples to support its argument."
