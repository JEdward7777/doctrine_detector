## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The prophet Nathan utilized a parable to confront King David in 2 Samuel 12. Nathan told David a story about a rich man who had many flocks and herds and a poor man who had only one little ewe lamb that he cherished. When a traveler came to visit the rich man, instead of taking one of his own animals to prepare a meal for the visitor, the rich man took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for dinner.

Through this parable, Nathan effectively conveyed to David the gravity of his sin. David was able to see the injustice and cruelty in the story, and Nathan revealed to him that the rich man in the parable represented David himself, and the poor man represented Uriah the Hittite, whom David had wronged by taking his wife Bathsheba and having him killed in battle. Nathan's use of the parable helped David to recognize his sin and repent before God.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, particularly in the story of King David's confrontation with Nathan. The writer effectively explains how Nathan used the parable to reveal the gravity of David's sin and lead him to repentance. The only area for improvement is that the response could provide more specific analysis of the parable itself, such as exploring its symbolism or cultural context. However, overall, the response shows a clear grasp of the concern and provides relevant biblical examples to support its argument.
