3. Interceding on behalf of the people through prayer and mediation (Numbers 6:22-27; Psalm 67:1-2).

Comment: The answer provides a good overview of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament according to the Bible, referencing relevant scriptures to support the points made. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the response could delve deeper into the significance and symbolism behind specific rituals and sacrifices performed by priests in the Old Testament. Additionally, further elaboration on the priestly role in mediating between God and His people, particularly in light of Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest in the New Testament, could strengthen the answer.
