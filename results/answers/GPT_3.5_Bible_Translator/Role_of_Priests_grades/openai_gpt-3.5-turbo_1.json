  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive overview of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, touching on key duties such as offering sacrifices, teaching God's laws, interceding for the people, maintaining the temple, and pronouncing blessings. The mention of preserving and teaching God's laws adds depth to the understanding of the priests' role. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included more specific references to biblical passages to support each point made and further enhance the understanding of the biblical role of priests."
