2. Preserving and teaching God's laws and commandments to the people (Deuteronomy 33:10; Malachi 2:7).
3. Interceding on behalf of the people through prayer and mediation (Numbers 6:22-27; Psalm 67:1-2).
4. Maintaining the holy sanctuary and performing rituals to maintain the purity and cleanliness of the temple (Leviticus 16; Numbers 18:1-7).
5. Pronouncing blessings and curses in accordance with God's will (Numbers 6:22-27; Deuteronomy 21:5).
