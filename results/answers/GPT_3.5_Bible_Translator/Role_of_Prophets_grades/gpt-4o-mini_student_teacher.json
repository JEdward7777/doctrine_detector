  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible. They accurately highlighted the various aspects of a prophet's role, such as communicating God's messages, bringing warnings, exhortations, predictions, and messages of encouragement or correction. The student also mentioned the importance of prophets guiding, instructing, challenging, and comforting the people, as well as playing a role in foretelling future events and pointing people back to God and His redemptive plan. \n\nWhile the student's answer goes beyond the reference answer by providing additional information and explanations, they have effectively captured the essence of a prophet's role based on biblical teachings. The minor difference in emphasis does not detract significantly from the core message. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical role of prophets and their messages."
