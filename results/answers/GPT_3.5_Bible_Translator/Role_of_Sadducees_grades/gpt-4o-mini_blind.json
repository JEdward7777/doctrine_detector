  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and accurate overview of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the historical and religious significance of the Sadducees within the context of ancient Judaism. The inclusion of key points such as presiding over sacrificial rituals, maintaining the Temple infrastructure, interpreting Jewish law, and their political leadership align well with a Christian specific worldview. Great job overall."
