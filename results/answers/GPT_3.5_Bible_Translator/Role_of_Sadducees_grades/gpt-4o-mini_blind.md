## [Answer](../Role_of_Sadducees.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Sadducees were a Jewish religious sect during the time of Jesus and the early Christian church. They were known for their strict adherence to the written Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) and their rejection of the oral traditions and interpretations of the Pharisees. 

The main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system included:
1. Presiding over the sacrificial rituals in the Temple: The Sadducees were predominantly made up of the priestly class and were responsible for overseeing the sacrificial system in the Temple in Jerusalem. This included offering sacrifices, conducting purification rituals, and ensuring that the Temple rituals were performed according to the law.

2. Maintaining the Temple infrastructure: The Sadducees were also responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the Temple, including overseeing the construction and repairs of the Temple buildings and structures.

3. Interpreting and applying certain aspects of Jewish law: While the Sadducees rejected the oral traditions and interpretations of the Pharisees, they did interpret and apply certain aspects of Jewish law based on their understanding of the written Torah.

4. Political leadership: In addition to their religious responsibilities, the Sadducees also held significant political power in ancient Judea. They often collaborated with the ruling authorities, such as the Roman Empire, to maintain order and stability in the region.

It is important to note that the influence and power of the Sadducees declined after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, and they eventually faded from prominence within Judaism.
