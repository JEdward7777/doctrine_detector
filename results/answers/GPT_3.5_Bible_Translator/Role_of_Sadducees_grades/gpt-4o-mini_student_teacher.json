  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system, incorporating historical and religious context. The student's answer goes beyond the reference answer by including additional details such as the political leadership role of the Sadducees. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the specific priestly tasks and rituals performed by the Sadducees in the temple complex, as highlighted in the reference answer."
