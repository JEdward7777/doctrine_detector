  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good explanation of how Scripture is used in sharing the Gospel message, drawing examples from the actions of Jesus, Peter, Paul, and references from the New Testament. They have correctly highlighted the importance of grounding evangelism in Scripture. However, they could strengthen their answer by providing more specific examples and directly connecting them to the integration of Scripture in communicating the Gospel. Overall, a solid response with room for slight improvement."
