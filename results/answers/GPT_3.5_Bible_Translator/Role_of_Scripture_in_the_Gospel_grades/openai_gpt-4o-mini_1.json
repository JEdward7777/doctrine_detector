  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 95. The student correctly identifies the examples of Philip and Paul using Scriptures in evangelism, demonstrating an understanding of the integration of Scripture in communicating the Gospel. The response also effectively references specific passages from the Bible (Acts and Romans) to support their point, showcasing a strong knowledge of how Scripture is used in sharing the Gospel message. The only area for improvement would be to provide a bit more detail or analysis in connecting the examples to the broader theological implications of Scripture in evangelism. Overall, a well-written and well-supported response."
