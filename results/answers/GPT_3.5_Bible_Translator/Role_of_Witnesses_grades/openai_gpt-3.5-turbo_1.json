  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a strong explanation of the role of witnesses in the New Testament, specifically focusing on their testimonies regarding Jesus' life and resurrection. It effectively highlights the significance of firsthand accounts in validating Christian beliefs. The concern raised about the importance of Christians witnessing their faith is relevant but not explicitly addressed in the response, hence a slight deduction in the grade."
