In the Old Testament, the high priest held a unique and elevated position among the priests of Israel. Some of the distinct responsibilities and privileges of the high priest compared to other priests included:

1. **Access to the Most Holy Place**: The high priest alone was allowed to enter the Most Holy Place in the tabernacle or temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, and to make atonement for the sins of the people on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16).

2. **Leadership**: The high priest was the head of the priestly order and responsible for overseeing the other priests and the religious rituals and ceremonies performed in the tabernacle or temple.

3. **Judgment and Decision-Making**: The high priest played a role in important legal and religious decisions, such as interpreting the law and resolving disputes among the people.

4. **Representative Role**: The high priest acted as a mediator between God and the people, offering sacrifices for their sins and interceding on their behalf.

5. **Ceremonial Attire**: The high priest wore distinctive garments, including the ephod, breastpiece, and turban, which symbolized his special status and role.

6. **Duration of Service**: Unlike other priests who served on a rotating basis, the high priest held the position for life or until he was no longer able to fulfill his duties.

Overall, the high priest held a position of great honor and responsibility in the religious life of Israel, serving as a bridge between God and the people and representing them before the Lord in matters of worship and atonement.
