1. **Access to the Most Holy Place**: The high priest alone was allowed to enter the Most Holy Place in the tabernacle or temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, and to make atonement for the sins of the people on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16).

2. **Leadership**: The high priest was the head of the priestly order and responsible for overseeing the other priests and the religious rituals and ceremonies performed in the tabernacle or temple.

3. **Judgment and Decision-Making**: The high priest played a role in important legal and religious decisions, such as interpreting the law and resolving disputes among the people.

6. **Duration of Service**: Unlike other priests who served on a rotating basis, the high priest held the position for life or until he was no longer able to fulfill his duties.

Overall, the high priest held a position of great honor and responsibility in the religious life of Israel, serving as a bridge between God and the people and representing them before the Lord in matters of worship and atonement.
