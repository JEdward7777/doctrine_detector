It references relevant Bible verses to support the points made and accurately describes the various ways in which the Holy Spirit works in a believer's life. The only improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of the believer's submission to the leading and guidance of the Holy Spirit in order to fully experience and utilize this empowerment."
