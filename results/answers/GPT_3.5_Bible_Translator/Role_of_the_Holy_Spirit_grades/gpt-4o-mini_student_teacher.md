## [Answer](../Role_of_the_Holy_Spirit.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Holy Spirit empowers a believer in various ways after they are born again. One of the primary ways is by giving them spiritual gifts for the common good of the church, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:7. These gifts can include abilities such as prophecy, speaking in tongues, teaching, serving, and others.

Additionally, the Holy Spirit helps believers grow in their faith and understanding of God's Word. Jesus promised in John 14:26 that the Holy Spirit would teach and remind believers of all that He had said.

The Holy Spirit also convicts believers of sin and guides them to live in a way that is pleasing to God. Romans 8:13-14 discusses how the Spirit helps believers put to death the deeds of the flesh and walk according to the Spirit.

Ultimately, the Holy Spirit empowers believers to live out their faith, bear fruit, and be effective witnesses for Christ in the world. This empowerment comes through the presence and work of the Holy Spirit within the believer's life.
