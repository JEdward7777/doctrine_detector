The Messiah, as prophesied in the Bible, fulfilled multiple roles. Here are some key roles:

1. Savior: The Messiah, Jesus Christ, came to save humanity from sin and reconcile us with God. Through His death on the cross, He provided the atonement for our sins and offered salvation to all who believe in Him (John 3:16, Romans 5:8).

2. King: The Messiah is seen as the promised King who establishes God's kingdom on earth. Jesus fulfilled this role by proclaiming the kingdom of God, though it may not have been in the way many expected (Matthew 4:17, John 18:36).

3. Prophet: The Messiah was prophesied to be a great prophet like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:15-19). Jesus fulfilled this role by teaching with authority, performing miracles, and fulfilling numerous Old Testament prophecies.

4. Priest: The Messiah was also prophesied to be a high priest who would offer the ultimate sacrifice for sin. Jesus fulfilled this role by offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of humanity, once and for all (Hebrews 7:26-27, Hebrews 10:10).

5. Judge: The Messiah is also seen as the ultimate judge who will separate the righteous from the unrighteous at the final judgment (Matthew 25:31-46, Romans 2:16).

Overall, the Messiah's roles encompassed salvation, kingship, prophecy, priesthood, and judgment, all of which Jesus fulfilled according to the Bible.
