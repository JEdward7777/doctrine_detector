## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the book of Exodus, God instructed the Israelites to gather manna as their daily food while they were in the wilderness. However, on the sixth day, they were told to gather a double portion of manna, enough for that day and the Sabbath day. This was to ensure that they did not have to work on the Sabbath day, as it was a day of rest set apart by God.

Exodus 16:23-26 (NIV) says, "He said to them, 'This is what the Lord commanded: "Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning."' So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it. 'Eat it today,' Moses said, 'because today is a sabbath to the Lord. You will not find any of it on the ground today. Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.'"

This instruction from God concerning the gathering of manna on the Sabbath was a demonstration of His provision and care for His people, as well as a reminder of the importance of honoring and observing the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.
