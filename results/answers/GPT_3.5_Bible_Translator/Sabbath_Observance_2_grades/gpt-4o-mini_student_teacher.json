  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student accurately explained how God instructed the Israelites to gather manna, specifically mentioning the double portion for the Sabbath day. They included the relevant passage from Exodus 16:23-26 and emphasized the significance of observing the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship according to God's command. The student demonstrated an understanding of the importance of honoring God's instructions regarding the Sabbath.\n\nHowever, the student's response could have been improved by directly stating that the Israelites were instructed to gather twice the amount of manna on the sixth day. The teacher's reference answer provided a concise and specific detail that was missing in the student's explanation. Clarifying this point would have strengthened the student's answer."
