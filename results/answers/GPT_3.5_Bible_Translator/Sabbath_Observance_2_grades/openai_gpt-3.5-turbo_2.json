It aligns well with the concern about the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands by emphasizing God's provision and care for His people in ensuring they had enough food on the Sabbath day. The response could be enhanced by including a reference to the specific scriptural passage from Exodus to further support the explanation."
