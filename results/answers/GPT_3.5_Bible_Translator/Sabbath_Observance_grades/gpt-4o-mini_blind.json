The connection between the Old Testament command in Exodus 20 and the Christian practice of observing the Sabbath on Sunday is appropriately addressed. The explanation could be enhanced by further emphasizing the theological significance of the Sabbath in Christian belief and how Jesus fulfilled the Sabbath as the Lord of the Sabbath."
