## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Keeping the Sabbath holy, as stated in the commandments given to Moses, means setting aside the seventh day of the week (Saturday) as a special day of rest and worship dedicated to God. This commandment is found in the Old Testament in Exodus 20:8-11, which says, "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."

Keeping the Sabbath holy involves refraining from secular work and activities, focusing on worship and rest, and spending time in prayer and reflection. It is a day to remember and honor God's creation and to cultivate our relationship with Him. Christians observe the Sabbath on Sunday, the day of Christ's resurrection, in light of the New Testament teachings and the early church tradition.
