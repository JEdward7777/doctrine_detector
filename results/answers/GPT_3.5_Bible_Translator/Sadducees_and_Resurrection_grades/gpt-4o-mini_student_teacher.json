  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the beliefs of the Sadducees and how they contrast with Christian teaching regarding the resurrection. The response effectively highlights the importance of the resurrection in Christian faith and its implications for believers. The student could have further elaborated on the theological significance of the resurrection in Christian doctrine, but overall, it was a well-articulated answer from a Christian worldview."
