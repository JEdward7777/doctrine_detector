The answer effectively connects Samson's actions with the specific requirements of the Nazirite vow and how his disobedience led to physical and spiritual consequences. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more specific references to relevant Bible verses and deepening the theological reflection on the implications of Samson's story within the broader biblical context of obedience and faithfulness. Overall, a solid analysis that demonstrates an understanding of the significance of honoring commitments to God."
