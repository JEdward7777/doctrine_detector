  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 75.\n\nThe student did a good job of explaining how Samson's actions impacted his strength due to breaking the Nazirite vow. They touched on key points such as the specific requirements of the vow and how Samson's disobedience led to his downfall. However, they could have strengthened their answer by focusing more on the divine purpose behind the Nazirite vow and the connection between personal commitment to God and the consequences of disobedience. The reference answer provided by the teacher highlights this important aspect, which the student missed addressing in their response. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the story but missed some key points related to the divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives."
