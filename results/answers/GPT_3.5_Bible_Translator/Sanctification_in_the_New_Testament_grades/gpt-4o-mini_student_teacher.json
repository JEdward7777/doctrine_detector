  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated response outlining the sanctification process according to the New Testament, emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives. However, the response could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the centrality of faith in the process of sanctification, as highlighted in the concern provided. The student effectively referenced key verses and concepts related to sanctification, but a stronger connection to the importance of faith would have enhanced the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
