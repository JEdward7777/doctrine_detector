It appropriately emphasizes the believer's cooperation with the Holy Spirit in growing in holiness and maturity. The only concern is that while faith is indirectly mentioned through the believer's cooperation with the Holy Spirit, it could have been further elaborated upon to explicitly address the concern of the role of faith in sanctification."
