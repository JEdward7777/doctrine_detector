## [Answer](../Sanctification_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The New Testament describes the sanctification process as the work of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives to make them more like Christ. The process involves the believer growing in holiness, obedience, and maturity in their faith through the empowering and transforming work of the Holy Spirit.

In Romans 6:22, the apostle Paul describes sanctification as being set free from sin and becoming slaves to righteousness. He also emphasizes the importance of renewal of the mind in Romans 12:2, which is a crucial aspect of the sanctification process.

Additionally, in 2 Corinthians 3:18, Paul writes about how believers are being transformed into the likeness of Christ with ever-increasing glory, which is the work of the Spirit in the process of sanctification.

Overall, sanctification is a lifelong process in which believers cooperate with the Holy Spirit to grow in their relationship with God, become more like Christ, and bear fruit in their lives for the glory of God.
