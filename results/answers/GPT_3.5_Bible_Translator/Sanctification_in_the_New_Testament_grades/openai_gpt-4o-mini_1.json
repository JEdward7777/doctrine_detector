It effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the role of faith in sanctification by highlighting the believer's cooperation with the Holy Spirit in growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ. The reference to key biblical passages and the emphasis on the lifelong aspect of sanctification further strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
