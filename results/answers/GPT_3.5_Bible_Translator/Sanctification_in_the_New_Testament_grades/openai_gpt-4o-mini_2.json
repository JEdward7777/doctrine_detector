The connection between faith and sanctification is effectively highlighted, emphasizing believers' cooperation with the Holy Spirit in growing in their relationship with God and becoming more like Christ. However, a stronger emphasis on the essential role of faith specifically in the process of sanctification could further enhance the response."
