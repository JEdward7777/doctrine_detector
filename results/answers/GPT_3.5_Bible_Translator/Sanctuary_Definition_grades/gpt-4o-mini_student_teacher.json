  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"sanctuary\" in the Biblical context, covering its meaning within the tabernacle or temple as a sacred place for God's presence and worship, as well as its broader application to include places of refuge and the Church as the body of Christ. While the answer aligns well with the given reference answer, it slightly deviates by expanding the concept to include the Church without highlighting the primary emphasis on the temple or tabernacle as the primary sanctuary in the Biblical context. Overall, a strong understanding demonstrated by the student."
