In the Bible, the term "sanctuary" refers to a sacred place dedicated to the worship of God. It can refer to the innermost part of the tabernacle or temple where the presence of God was believed to dwell, such as the Most Holy Place. The sanctuary was considered holy and set apart from the common areas for the worship and service of God.

In a broader sense, the term "sanctuary" can also refer to a place of refuge and protection. In the Old Testament, cities of refuge were designated as sanctuaries for individuals who accidentally killed someone. In the New Testament, the concept of sanctuary is extended to include the Church as the body of Christ, where believers find spiritual refuge and nourishment.

Ultimately, the idea of sanctuary in the Bible reflects the holiness and presence of God, as well as the sacred space where believers can draw near to Him in worship and find safety and security in His love and grace.
