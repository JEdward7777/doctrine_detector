  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively articulates the significance of the sanctuary as a place where God dwelt among His people and a source of safety for them. The response references relevant scripture from Exodus and highlights the symbolic elements of the sanctuary, such as the Ark of the Covenant. The student also correctly emphasizes the sanctuary as a place of worship, sacrifice, and reconciliation. However, the student could have further integrated the concept of the sanctuary being a safe haven for God's people, as mentioned in the reference answer, to enhance the depth of their explanation."
