  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the sanctuary as a place where God dwelt among His people and as a source of safety and protection. It effectively highlights the sanctuary as a symbol of God's desire for a close relationship with His people. The biblical references and explanations are clear and support the Christian worldview perspective. The grade could have been higher if there had been more integration of Christian theological concepts or deeper analysis of the sanctuary's role in God's plan of salvation."
