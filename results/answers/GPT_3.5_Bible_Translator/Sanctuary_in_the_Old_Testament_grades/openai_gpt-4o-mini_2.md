In the Old Testament, God described the sanctuary as a place where He would dwell among His people. In Exodus 25:8, God instructed the Israelites to build a sanctuary so that He could dwell among them. The sanctuary, also known as the tabernacle, was a physical representation of God's presence among His people.

Godâ€™s presence in the sanctuary was symbolized by the presence of the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments. The sanctuary was a holy place where the Israelites could come to worship God, offer sacrifices, and seek forgiveness for their sins.

Throughout the Old Testament, the sanctuary served as a reminder of God's faithfulness, His holiness, and His desire to be in relationship with His people. It was a place of worship, sacrifice, and reconciliation where the Israelites could come before God in humility and obedience.

Overall, the sanctuary was a symbol of the close relationship that God desired to have with His people, and it served as a tangible representation of His presence among them.
