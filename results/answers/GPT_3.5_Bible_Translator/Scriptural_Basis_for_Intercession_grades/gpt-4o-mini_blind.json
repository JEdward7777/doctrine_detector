The references to key passages such as Romans 8:34, James 5:16, 1 Timothy 2:1, Hebrews 7:25, and Colossians 4:12 demonstrate a good understanding of the importance of intercessory prayer in the Christian faith. The explanation of each verse is clear and ties back to the overall theme of intercession. Well done!"
