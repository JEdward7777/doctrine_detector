There are several Bible verses that provide insights into the practice of interceding for others:

2. James 5:16 - "Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." This verse emphasizes the importance of praying for one another and the effectiveness of the prayers of the righteous.

3. 1 Timothy 2:1 - "I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people." This verse encourages believers to engage in various forms of prayer, including intercession, for all people.

4. Hebrews 7:25 - "Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them." This verse speaks of the never-ending intercession of Jesus on behalf of those who come to God through him.

5. Colossians 4:12 - "Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured." This verse illustrates the dedicated intercessory prayer of Epaphras for the believers in Colossae.
