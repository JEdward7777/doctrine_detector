  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response successfully connects the theological concept of propitiation with biblical references, highlighting key verses that support the idea. The inclusion of multiple verses from different books (1 John, Romans) demonstrates a good understanding of the scope and depth of Scripture on this topic. The explanation is clear and concise, making it easy for readers to follow.\n\nTo reach 100%, I would suggest adding more depth and nuance to the explanation, perhaps exploring the implications of propitiation or how it relates to other biblical themes (e.g., justification, redemption). Additionally, a brief summary or conclusion that ties everything together could enhance the overall effectiveness of the response. Nevertheless, this is a strong effort that effectively connects biblical references with theological concepts!"
