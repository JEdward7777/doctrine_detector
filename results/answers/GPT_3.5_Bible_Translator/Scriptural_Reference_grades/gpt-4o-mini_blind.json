  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights key biblical passages that address the concept of the \"world\" in relation to believers, emphasizing the tension between Christians and the values of the world. The inclusion of relevant verses from John, Romans, and 1 John demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job overall."
