  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with relevant biblical passages that address the concept of the \"world\" in relation to believers. The inclusion of key verses such as John 3:16-17, Romans 12:2, John 15:19, and 1 John 2:15-17 demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. However, the student could have further strengthened their answer by including the specific references mentioned by the teacher, 1 John 2:15, 1 John 4:5, and John 1:29, to fully align with the provided reference answer."
