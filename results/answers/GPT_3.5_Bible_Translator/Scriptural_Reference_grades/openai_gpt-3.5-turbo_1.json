  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of key biblical passages addressing believers' relationship with the world and how to navigate life in a world characterized by ungodly values. The inclusion of specific relevant passages and the emphasis on the tension between believers and the world align well with a Christian worldview. However, it could be strengthened by including a deeper analysis or application of the passages provided."
