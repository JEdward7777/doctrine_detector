  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of biblical passages that address the believer's relationship with the world and effectively addresses the concern of navigating life in a world with ungodly values. By referencing key passages and emphasizing the importance of being separate from the world while showing love and service to others, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a bit more depth or personal application in the explanation."
