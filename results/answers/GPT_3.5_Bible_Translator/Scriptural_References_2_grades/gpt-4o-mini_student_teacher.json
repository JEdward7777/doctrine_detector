  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and thorough response by referencing key biblical passages that support the concept of the day of judgment. The verses they chose align with the Christian worldview and effectively reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs regarding judgment. However, the student missed out on the specific passages identified in the reference answer provided by the teacher, which could have further enriched their response."
