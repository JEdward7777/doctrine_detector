## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
There are several biblical passages that support the concept of the day of judgment. Here are a few key verses:

1. Matthew 25:31-46 - In this passage, Jesus speaks about the final judgment when he will separate the righteous from the wicked, likening it to a shepherd separating his sheep from the goats.
  
2. Acts 17:31 - Paul speaks to the Athenians about the day when God will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed (Jesus).

3. 2 Corinthians 5:10 - Paul writes that we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.

4. Revelation 20:11-15 - This passage describes the great white throne judgment, where all the dead, great and small, will stand before God. Books will be opened, and the dead will be judged according to what they have done.

These passages point to the certainty of a day of judgment when all people will be held accountable for their actions and beliefs, and God's justice will be fully revealed.
