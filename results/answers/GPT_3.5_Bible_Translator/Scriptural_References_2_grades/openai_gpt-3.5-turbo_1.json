It effectively addresses the concern by referencing key passages and offering detailed explanations from the Bible that deepen the understanding of God's judgment and reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs. The inclusion of specific verses and their explanations demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
