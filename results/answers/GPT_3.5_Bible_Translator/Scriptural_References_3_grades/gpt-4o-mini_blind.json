The emphasis on iniquity originating from the heart, its deceptive nature, and the contrast with true righteousness is well-explained. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the response could have included more emphasis on the role of repentance and the need for inner transformation through the power of the Holy Spirit in overcoming iniquity. Additionally, tying in the broader context of Jesus' overall message to the religious leaders would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the passage."
