  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of Matthew 23:27-28, demonstrating a solid understanding of the nature of iniquity as presented in the passage. They effectively connected the concept of iniquity to matters of the heart, deception, and the contrast between outward appearances and genuine righteousness. The student's response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer and effectively addresses the concern provided."
