## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Matthew 23:27-28, Jesus is speaking to the religious leaders of his time, condemning their hypocrisy and outward show of righteousness while their hearts were full of iniquity. The passage reads:

"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."

This passage teaches us several things about the nature of iniquity:

1. **Iniquity is a matter of the heart:** Jesus emphasizes that iniquity is not just about external actions, but it originates from the heart. The religious leaders were focused on outward appearances and rituals, but their hearts were far from God.

2. **Iniquity is deceptive:** Iniquity can be deceptive, making a person appear righteous on the outside while harboring sin within. The whitewashed tombs symbolize this deception – they may look clean and beautiful, but they contain death and uncleanness within.

3. **Iniquity is incompatible with true righteousness:** True righteousness is not just about following external rules and rituals, but it involves a genuine transformation of the heart. Iniquity and righteousness cannot coexist – a heart filled with iniquity cannot truly be righteous.

Overall, this passage reminds us that iniquity is a serious matter that goes beyond external actions. It highlights the importance of genuine repentance, transformation of the heart, and living a life of true righteousness before God.
