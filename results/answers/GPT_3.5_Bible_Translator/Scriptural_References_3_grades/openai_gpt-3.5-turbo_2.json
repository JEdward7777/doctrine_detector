It aligns well with the concern provided, urging Christians to seek true holiness rather than just external compliance. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a direct reference to Jesus' condemnation of the religious leaders in order to strengthen the connection between the passage and the importance of pursuing genuine holiness."
