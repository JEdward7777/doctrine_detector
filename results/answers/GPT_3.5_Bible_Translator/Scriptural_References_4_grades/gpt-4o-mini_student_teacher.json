  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85. \n\nThe student effectively discusses the significance of birthright in Biblical teachings by referencing the passages provided and providing insightful reflections on their implications. They correctly point out the importance of valuing and honoring one's spiritual inheritance, as well as the consequences of neglecting it. However, the answer could be improved by more directly addressing the concern of scripture interpretation and its relevance to contemporary Christian life, as indicated in the prompt. Including examples of how these teachings can be applied in modern-day Christian living would strengthen the response. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic but could connect it more explicitly to contemporary Christian practice."
