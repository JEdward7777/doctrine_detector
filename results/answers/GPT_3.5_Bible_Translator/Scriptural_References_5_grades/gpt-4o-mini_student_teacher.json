  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid answer by referencing Luke 16:19-31 and Revelation 20:13-14, which indeed highlight the shift in understanding of Hades as a place associated with the unrighteous. However, the teacher's reference answer specifically pointed out Luke 16:23 and Luke 23:43 as the key verses illustrating this shift, so the student could have included Luke 23:43 to align more closely with the teacher's guidance. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have been more precise in selecting the cited verses."
