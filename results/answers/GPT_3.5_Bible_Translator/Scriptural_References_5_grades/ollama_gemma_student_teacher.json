  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer adequately identifies relevant New Testament verses that support the claim of a shift in understanding Hades from a neutral place to one associated with the unrighteous. The inclusion of Luke 16:19-31 and Revelation 20:13-14 demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant textual evidence. However, the student's response would benefit from additional elaboration and citation of other supporting passages from Scripture to strengthen their argument."
