The mention of Luke 16:23 is particularly helpful in highlighting this shift.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more detailed analysis and interpretation of the biblical passages provided. For example, what are the implications of Jesus' parable in Luke 16:19-31 for our understanding of Hades and its relationship to salvation? How do the descriptions of Hades in Revelation 20:13-14 inform our eschatological expectations?\n\nAdditionally, while the response mentions two key passages, it could benefit from further exploration of other relevant biblical texts that shed light on the nature of Hades. Overall, the response demonstrates some understanding of the scriptural evidence but could be developed further to provide more nuanced and comprehensive insights."
