## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_7.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In 1 Peter 5:5-7, we see the concept of exaltation being illustrated through the idea that if we humble ourselves before God, He will exalt us in due time. Verse 6 specifically says, "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you."

This verse teaches us that God values humility and a contrite spirit, and when we humble ourselves before Him, acknowledging our dependence on Him and our need for His grace, He will ultimately exalt us in His perfect timing. This exaltation may come in various forms, such as receiving spiritual blessings, growth in faith, or positions of influence to serve His kingdom.

In Philippians 2:9-11, we see a powerful illustration of exaltation in the person of Jesus Christ. These verses describe how, because of Jesus' humility and obedience to the point of death on the cross, God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name above all names, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.

Through His sacrificial death and resurrection, Jesus exemplified the ultimate act of humility and obedience, which ultimately led to His exaltation and glorification by the Father. This serves as a model for believers to follow in our own lives, knowing that when we humble ourselves before God and follow Christ's example, we too can experience the promise of exaltation in Him.

Overall, these verses teach us that true exaltation in the Christian faith comes not through self-promotion or seeking worldly recognition, but through humble submission to God, obedience to His will, and ultimately finding our identity and worth in Him.
