The student effectively explains how humility before God leads to exaltation, using the example of Jesus Christ as the ultimate model of humility and obedience resulting in exaltation. The response is well-reasoned, insightful, and supported by scriptural references, demonstrating a solid understanding of the Christian worldview on humility and exaltation."
