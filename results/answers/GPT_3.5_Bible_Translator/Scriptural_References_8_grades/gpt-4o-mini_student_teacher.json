  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided relevant scriptural references and explained the concept of being blameless well in alignment with a Christian worldview. However, there was a slight deviation in the specific references mentioned compared to the teacher's answer, which is why the grade is slightly lower. Encouraging the student to ensure closer alignment with the specified references in future responses."
