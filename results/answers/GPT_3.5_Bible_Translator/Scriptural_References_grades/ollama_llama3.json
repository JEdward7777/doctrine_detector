  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response correctly identifies the biblical reference to God as \"Almighty\" in Genesis 17:1, which addresses the concern of knowing biblical references that deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises. However, the response is quite brief and lacks any further explanation or reflection on the significance of this title or its relevance to our lives.\n\nTo reach a higher grade, the response could have explored the implications of God being \"Almighty\" for Abraham's faith and obedience, or how this title relates to our own experiences with God. Nevertheless, the response still demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical text and its significance in deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises.\n\nComment: A stronger response would have provided more depth and application to the reference, but this response is still a solid foundation for further exploration and growth."
