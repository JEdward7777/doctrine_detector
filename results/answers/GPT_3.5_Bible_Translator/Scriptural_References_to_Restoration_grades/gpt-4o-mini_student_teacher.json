However, there was room for improvement in terms of incorporating more diverse verses that directly support the concept of restoration in one's faith journey, as indicated in the teacher's reference answer. Strengthening the scriptural references and expanding on the themes of renewal and reconciliation would have enhanced the student's response further."
