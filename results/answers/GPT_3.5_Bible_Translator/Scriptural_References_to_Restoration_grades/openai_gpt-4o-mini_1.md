One of the key verses emphasizing the theme of restoration in the Bible is Joel 2:25-26, which says, "I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you. You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame."

Another important verse on restoration is Isaiah 61:7, which states, "Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion; instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot; therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion; they shall have everlasting joy."

This verse speaks of God's desire to turn shame and dishonor into honor and joy, and it emphasizes the abundant blessings and restoration that God promises to his people.

Overall, these verses illustrate the theme of restoration as a central aspect of God's character and His relationship with His people. God is portrayed as a restorer who brings hope, healing, and renewal to those who trust in Him.
