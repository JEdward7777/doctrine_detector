The connection to the relevance of spiritual vigilance and integrity in a believer's life is well-addressed. The only minor improvement could be to expand a bit more on the specific ways a believer can actively guard against developing a seared conscience, such as through reliance on the Holy Spirit, prayer, and accountability within a Christian community."
