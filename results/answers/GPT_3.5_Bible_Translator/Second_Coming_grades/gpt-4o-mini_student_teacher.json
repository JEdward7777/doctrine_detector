  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the implications of Jesus' statement about the \"Son of Man\" coming back on the clouds for believers. They highlighted important truths such as judgment, victory and redemption, hope and comfort, as well as watchfulness and readiness. The connection to the Parousia and the call to live faithfully in anticipation of Christ's return was well articulated. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the specific Christian hope and eschatological implications tied to Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man', aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
