  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer referencing relevant biblical teachings on humility and the dangers of exalting oneself. They effectively highlighted the negative consequences of pride and selfishness, aligning with the concern of recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride. However, the student could have further emphasized the specific dangers of arrogance and separation from God as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a good understanding of the biblical perspective on exalting oneself."
