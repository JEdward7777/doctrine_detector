## Question [Self-Exaltation](../../../questions/Self-Exaltation.md)
What are the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings?

## Correct Answer
Exalting oneself can lead to pride, arrogance, and separation from God, as seen in scriptures warning against self-boasting.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride.

## [Answer](../Self-Exaltation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Exalting oneself goes against the teachings of humility found throughout the Bible. Proverbs 16:18 warns, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." Additionally, Philippians 2:3 instructs us to "do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves." When we exalt ourselves, we are putting our own desires and interests above those of others and above God, leading to pride, selfishness, and potentially destructive behavior. It can also lead to a lack of dependence on God and a failure to recognize our need for His grace and guidance in our lives. Ultimately, exalting oneself can hinder our relationship with God and others, and can prevent us from experiencing the fullness of a life lived in humble service and obedience to Him.

90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response adequately addresses the concern of recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride, specifically exalting oneself. It correctly identifies that exalting oneself can lead to destructive behavior and hinders our relationship with God and others. The biblical references provided (Proverbs 16:18 and Philippians 2:3) are relevant and support the conclusion.

The only area for improvement is the response could have delved deeper into the consequences of exalting oneself, such as the lack of dependence on God and failure to recognize our need for His grace. Additionally, some more nuanced language or examples would strengthen the argument.

However, overall, this response effectively recognizes and addresses the sin of pride, making it a strong submission.
