## Question [Self-Exaltation](../../../questions/Self-Exaltation.md)
What are the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings?

## Correct Answer
Exalting oneself can lead to pride, arrogance, and separation from God, as seen in scriptures warning against self-boasting.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride.

## [Answer](../Self-Exaltation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Exalting oneself goes against the teachings of humility found throughout the Bible. Proverbs 16:18 warns, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." Additionally, Philippians 2:3 instructs us to "do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves." When we exalt ourselves, we are putting our own desires and interests above those of others and above God, leading to pride, selfishness, and potentially destructive behavior. It can also lead to a lack of dependence on God and a failure to recognize our need for His grace and guidance in our lives. Ultimately, exalting oneself can hinder our relationship with God and others, and can prevent us from experiencing the fullness of a life lived in humble service and obedience to Him.
