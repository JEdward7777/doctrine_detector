  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the Pharisees' concern for maintaining separation from Gentiles to preserve religious purity and adherence to Jewish laws and traditions. It also effectively ties this concern to the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context. The reference to Exodus 19:6 and the emphasis on Jesus' teachings add depth to the analysis from a Christian worldview. Overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding and application of Christian principles to the given concern."
