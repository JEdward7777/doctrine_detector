The integration of relevant biblical references and the acknowledgment of Jesus' teachings on inclusivity add depth to the analysis. However, the response could have further elaborated on how Jesus' challenges to the Pharisees were rooted in a deeper understanding of God's intentions for His people and the importance of love and compassion in faith."
