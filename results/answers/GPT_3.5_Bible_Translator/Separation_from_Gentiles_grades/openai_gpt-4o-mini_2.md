## [Answer](../Separation_from_Gentiles.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Pharisees were concerned about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles due to their strict adherence to the Jewish religious laws and traditions, as well as concerns about maintaining the purity and distinctiveness of the Jewish identity. In the Old Testament, God had instructed the Israelites to be a separate and holy nation unto Him (Exodus 19:6), and so the Pharisees sought to ensure that the Jewish people remained faithful to their covenant with God by observing the laws and customs that set them apart from other cultures and religions.

The Pharisees believed that associating with Gentiles could lead to the contamination of Jewish purity, particularly in matters of faith and morality. They were also wary of the influence of Gentile customs and beliefs on Jewish culture and religious practices. Additionally, the Pharisees believed that maintaining separation from Gentiles would help preserve the distinctiveness of the Jewish people as God's chosen nation and prevent them from being led astray from the true worship of God.

However, it is important to note that Jesus challenged the Pharisees' emphasis on external rituals and regulations, teaching instead about the importance of inward purity and love for all people, both Jews and Gentiles. Jesus' ministry emphasized inclusivity and the breaking down of barriers between different groups of people, demonstrating God's love and grace to all.
