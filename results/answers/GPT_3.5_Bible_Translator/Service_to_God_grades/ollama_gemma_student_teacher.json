It provides specific examples from Scripture to support each point. The response aligns well with the reference answer from the teacher, covering crucial aspects such as teaching, caring for the sick, and providing for the poor. However, the inclusion of additional areas like proclaiming the Gospel and utilizing spiritual gifts broadens the scope of the response and demonstrates a deeper understanding of Christian service."
