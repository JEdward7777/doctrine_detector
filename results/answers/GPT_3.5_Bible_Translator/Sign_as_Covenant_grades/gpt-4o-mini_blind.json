It correctly references the biblical passage in Genesis 9:12-17 and discusses the covenant made by God with Noah and his descendants after the Great Flood. The answer also emphasizes the symbolism of the rainbow as a visible reminder of God's faithfulness and mercy. The only improvement would be to further elaborate on the covenant aspect - perhaps by mentioning the specific conditions or terms of the covenant and how it relates to God's character of love and justice."
