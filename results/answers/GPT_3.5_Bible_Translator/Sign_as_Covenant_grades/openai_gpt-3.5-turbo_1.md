In the Bible, the rainbow is described as a sign of God's covenant with humanity in Genesis 9:12-17. After the Great Flood, God made a covenant with Noah and his descendants, promising never again to flood the whole earth. The rainbow serves as a visible reminder of this promise, symbolizing God's faithfulness and mercy. When God sees the rainbow, it serves as a reminder to Him of His covenant with humanity, and it reassures us of His enduring love and faithfulness.
