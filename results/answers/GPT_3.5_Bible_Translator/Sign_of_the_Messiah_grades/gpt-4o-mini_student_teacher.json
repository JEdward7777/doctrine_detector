  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-rounded explanation of the significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke regarding the birth of Jesus, highlighting key aspects such as inclusivity, humility, and the message of hope and reconciliation. However, the student's response focuses more on the broader theological implications and themes surrounding the birth of Jesus rather than directly addressing the concern of recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs. The reference answer provides a more precise and focused response in this regard, earning a slightly lower grade for the student's answer."
