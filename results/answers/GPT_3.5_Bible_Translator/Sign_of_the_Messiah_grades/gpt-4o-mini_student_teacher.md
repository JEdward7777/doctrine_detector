The sign given to the shepherds in Luke regarding the birth of Jesus is significant for several reasons. Firstly, the appearance of the angel to announce the birth of Jesus signifies that this event is of great importance in God's plan of salvation for the world. The shepherds, who were considered lowly and ordinary people, being chosen to receive this message highlights the inclusive nature of God's salvation, available to all people regardless of social status.

Secondly, the sign of the baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger serves as a humble and unexpected way for the Savior of the world to enter into the world. It emphasizes the humility and accessibility of Jesus, who came to identify with humanity in all aspects, including being born in lowly circumstances.

Furthermore, the announcement of peace on earth and goodwill toward men that accompanies the sign emphasizes the message of hope and reconciliation that Jesus brings to the world through his birth, life, death, and resurrection. The sign to the shepherds serves as a confirmation of the prophetic promises of the Messiah's coming and invites all people to participate in the joy and peace brought by Jesus.

Overall, the sign given to the shepherds in Luke regarding the birth of Jesus carries deep theological significance, highlighting the humility, inclusivity, and transformative power of the Savior who came to bring salvation and peace to all people.

Comment: The student's answer provides a well-rounded explanation of the significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke regarding the birth of Jesus, highlighting key aspects such as inclusivity, humility, and the message of hope and reconciliation. However, the student's response focuses more on the broader theological implications and themes surrounding the birth of Jesus rather than directly addressing the concern of recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs.
