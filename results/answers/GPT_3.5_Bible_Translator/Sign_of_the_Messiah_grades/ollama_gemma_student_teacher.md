It emphasizes the humility and accessibility of Jesus, who came to identify with humanity in all aspects, including being born in lowly circumstances.

Furthermore, the announcement of peace on earth and goodwill toward men that accompanies the sign emphasizes the message of hope and reconciliation that Jesus brings to the world through his birth, life, death, and resurrection. The sign to the shepherds serves as a confirmation of the prophetic promises of the Messiah's coming and invites all people to participate in the joy and peace brought by Jesus.
