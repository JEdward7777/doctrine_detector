The answer effectively addresses the concern by linking the sign to the fulfillment of prophecies and God's ultimate plan of salvation through the Messiah. The response could be strengthened by directly referencing specific prophecies from the Old Testament that were fulfilled through this sign, providing additional biblical support."
