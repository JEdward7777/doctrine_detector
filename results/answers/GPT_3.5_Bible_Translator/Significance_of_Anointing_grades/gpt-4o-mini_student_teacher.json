  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the significance of anointing in the context of Old Testament priests, kings, and prophets. They demonstrate a clear understanding of how anointing was a symbolic act of consecration and empowerment for specific roles. The explanation is detailed and covers the key aspects of anointing for each leadership role. However, the student's response could be improved by explicitly mentioning how anointing set apart these individuals for service to God, which is a crucial aspect emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
