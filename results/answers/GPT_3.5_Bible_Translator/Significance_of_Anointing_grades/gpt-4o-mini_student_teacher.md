For prophets, anointing with oil symbolized the commissioning by God to speak His messages to the people. It signified the authority and power given by God to proclaim His word and call the people to repentance and obedience.

Overall, anointing in the Old Testament represented God's presence, approval, and empowerment upon His chosen servants for their specific roles in fulfilling His purposes and plans.
