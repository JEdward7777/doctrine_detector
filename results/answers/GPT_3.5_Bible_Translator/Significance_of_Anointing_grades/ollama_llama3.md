Anointing in the Old Testament was a symbolic act of consecration and empowerment by God for a specific role or purpose. 

For priests, anointing with oil signified their separation and empowerment for the sacred duty of serving in the tabernacle or temple, offering sacrifices, and interceding before God on behalf of the people.

For kings, anointing with oil was a sign of God's choice and empowerment for leadership. It indicated that the king was set apart to rule, protect, and shepherd the people according to God's will.

For prophets, anointing with oil symbolized the commissioning by God to speak His messages to the people. It signified the authority and power given by God to proclaim His word and call the people to repentance and obedience.

Overall, anointing in the Old Testament represented God's presence, approval, and empowerment upon His chosen servants for their specific roles in fulfilling His purposes and plans.
