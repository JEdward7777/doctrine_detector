They correctly touch on the meaning and significance of the title \"Shaddai\" in conveying God's power, strength, stability, and nourishment. However, it would have enhanced the response if the student had included more explicit references to specific Biblical passages where \"Shaddai\" is used and how these attributes are demonstrated in those contexts. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of God being referred to as \"Shaddai\" could have strengthened the answer further."
