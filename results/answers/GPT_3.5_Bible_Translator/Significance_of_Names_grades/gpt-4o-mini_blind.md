## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "Shaddai" is often translated rather than transliterated in Bible translations because it signifies the power and might of God. The Hebrew word "Shaddai" is thought to be derived from the root word meaning "mountain" or "breast," symbolizing God's strength, stability, and nourishment. By translating it rather than leaving it as a name, translators aim to convey the attributes and characteristics of God associated with this title.

Additionally, using a translation rather than a transliteration can help convey these meanings to readers who may not be familiar with the original Hebrew language. It provides a more accessible way for readers to understand and appreciate the significance of God's power and provision as described by the term "Shaddai" in the Bible.

Grade: 80

Comments: The student has provided a generally sound explanation of why "Shaddai" is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. They correctly touch on the meaning and significance of the title "Shaddai" in conveying God's power, strength, stability, and nourishment. However, it would have enhanced the response if the student had included more explicit references to specific Biblical passages where "Shaddai" is used and how these attributes are demonstrated in those contexts. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of God being referred to as "Shaddai" could have strengthened the answer further.
