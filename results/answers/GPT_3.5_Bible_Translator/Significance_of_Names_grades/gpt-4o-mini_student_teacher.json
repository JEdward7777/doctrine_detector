  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of why \"Shaddai\" is often translated as a title in Bible translations, highlighting the significance of conveying God's attributes. However, the response could be improved by emphasizing more on the relational aspect with God, which is a key concern in the Christian faith. The answer lacked depth in connecting the translation choice to deepening understanding of God's character and relational aspect, hence the grade of 80."
