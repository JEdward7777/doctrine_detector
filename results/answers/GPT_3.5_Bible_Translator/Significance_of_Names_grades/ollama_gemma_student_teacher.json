  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. They effectively explain the connection between the title and God's power and might, drawing on the symbolic meanings of \"mountain\" and \"breast.\" Additionally, the student acknowledges the need for accessibility to readers unfamiliar with Hebrew, making their argument more comprehensive."
