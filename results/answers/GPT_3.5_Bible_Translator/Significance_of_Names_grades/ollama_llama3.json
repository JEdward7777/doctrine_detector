  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of why \"Shaddai\" is often translated rather than transliterated, highlighting its significance in conveying God's power, strength, and provision. The discussion also touches on the importance of translation in making the text accessible to readers who may not be familiar with Hebrew. These points align well with the concern about deepening understanding of God's character and relational aspect.\n\nThe response could have scored higher if it had directly addressed the contrast between translating \"Shaddai\" as a title versus using it as a name, as mentioned in the answer. However, the response does implicitly touch on this idea by emphasizing the attributes and characteristics associated with the term \"Shaddai\", which is in line with the concern.\n\nComment: The grade of 85 reflects the response's overall strength in providing relevant information about the significance of \"Shaddai\" and its implications for deepening understanding of God's character. To reach a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the discussion to the contrast between title and name, or provided additional insights on how this term relates to our understanding of God's relational aspect in Christian faith."
