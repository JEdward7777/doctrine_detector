## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

## Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "Shaddai" is often translated rather than transliterated in Bible translations because it signifies the power and might of God. The Hebrew word "Shaddai" is thought to be derived from the root word meaning "mountain" or "breast," symbolizing God's strength, stability, and nourishment. By translating it rather than leaving it as a name, translators aim to convey the attributes and characteristics of God associated with this title.

Additionally, using a translation rather than a transliteration can help convey these meanings to readers who may not be familiar with the original Hebrew language. It provides a more accessible way for readers to understand and appreciate the significance of God's power and provision as described by the term "Shaddai" in the Bible.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a clear explanation of why "Shaddai" is often translated rather than transliterated, highlighting its significance in conveying God's power, strength, and provision. The discussion also touches on the importance of translation in making the text accessible to readers who may not be familiar with Hebrew. These points align well with the concern about deepening understanding of God's character and relational aspect.

The response could have scored higher if it had directly addressed the contrast between translating "Shaddai" as a title versus using it as a name, as mentioned in the answer. However, the response does implicitly touch on this idea by emphasizing the attributes and characteristics associated with the term "Shaddai", which is in line with the concern.

Comment: The grade of 85 reflects the response's overall strength in providing relevant information about the significance of "Shaddai" and its implications for deepening understanding of God's character. To reach a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the discussion to the contrast between title and name, or provided additional insights on how this term relates to our understanding of God's relational aspect in Christian faith.
