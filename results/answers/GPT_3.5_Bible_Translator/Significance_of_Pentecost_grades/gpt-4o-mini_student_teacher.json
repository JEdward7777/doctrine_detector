  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of the Day of Pentecost in the New Testament, specifically highlighting the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and its role in empowering believers for ministry. The response effectively connects the event to biblical references, the birth of the Christian church, and the fulfillment of Jesus' promise. However, the student's answer could have been improved by further emphasizing the transformative and empowering role of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers and the significance of this event in shaping the early church's mission and growth."
