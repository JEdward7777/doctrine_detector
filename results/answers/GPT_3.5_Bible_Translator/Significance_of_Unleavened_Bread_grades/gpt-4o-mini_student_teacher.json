  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as a 90. The student effectively explains the symbolism of unleavened bread in relation to sin and living a life that honors God, drawing from both Old Testament and Christian teachings. They make a clear connection between the removal of sin and striving for purity, sincerity, and obedience to God. The answer also emphasizes the significance of faith, repentance, and obedience in honoring God. While the response expands upon the reference answer and provides additional context, it aligns well with Christian teachings on the symbolism of unleavened bread."
