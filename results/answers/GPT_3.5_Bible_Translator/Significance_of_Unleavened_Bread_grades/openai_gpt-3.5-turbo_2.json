It effectively explains how unleavened bread symbolizes purity, sincerity, and freedom from sin, tying it to the Old Testament symbolism and its relevance to Christians today. The response also emphasizes the importance of living a life that honors God through faith, repentance, and obedience. Great job in addressing the concern with depth and clarity."
