  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student provides a thorough explanation of the title \"tetrarch\" during the time of Jesus, and correctly identifies Herod Antipas as a specific tetrarch mentioned in the New Testament. The student also relates the concept of tetrarchs to the broader Roman governance structure, showcasing an understanding of the political landscape during Jesus' time.\n\nHowever, the student could further strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting the concept of tetrarchs and Roman rule to the specified concern provided, which is understanding the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry. By making this connection more explicit, the student's response would more directly address the concern related to believers' comprehension of the political context during Jesus' time."
