## [Answer](../Significance_of_the_Tetrarch_Title.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "tetrarch" was used during the time of Jesus to refer to a ruler who was in charge of a fourth part of a region or kingdom. Tetrarchs were subordinate rulers who administered smaller territories under the authority of a higher-ranking ruler, such as a king or emperor.

In the New Testament, the title "tetrarch" is specifically used to refer to Herod Antipas, who ruled over Galilee and Perea during the time of Jesus. This governance structure was reflective of the Roman system of dividing territories among multiple rulers to more effectively govern vast regions of the empire.

The existence of tetrarchs like Herod Antipas demonstrates the political complexity and fragmentation of power during the time of Jesus, as well as the influence of Roman rule over the region of Judea and surrounding areas. The title 'tetrarch' reveals the intricacies of governance and authority structures in place during the time of Jesus, highlighting the political context in which Jesus' ministry and teachings took place.
