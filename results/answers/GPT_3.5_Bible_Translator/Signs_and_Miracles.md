## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Signs and miracles play a significant role in proving the truth of God's message in the Bible. Throughout the Gospels, we see Jesus performing miracles such as healing the sick, raising the dead, and casting out demons. These signs were not only acts of compassion and mercy but also served as evidence of Jesus' divine authority and identity as the Son of God.

In John 10:37-38, Jesus says, "Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father. But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father." Jesus' miracles confirmed the truth of His message and demonstrated the power and authority of God working through Him.

Similarly, in the book of Acts, we see the apostles performing miracles such as healing the sick, speaking in tongues, and even raising the dead. These signs and wonders served to validate the apostles' message and authenticate their authority as messengers of God. In Acts 2:22, Peter declares, "Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know."

While signs and miracles are powerful demonstrations of God's power and presence, it is important to remember that faith does not ultimately rest on miracles alone. Jesus Himself warned against seeking signs for the sake of signs (John 4:48) and emphasized the importance of faith based on the Word of God (John 20:29). Miracles can confirm the truth of God's message, but it is ultimately the message itself—the Gospel of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ—that holds the power to transform hearts and bring people into relationship with God.
