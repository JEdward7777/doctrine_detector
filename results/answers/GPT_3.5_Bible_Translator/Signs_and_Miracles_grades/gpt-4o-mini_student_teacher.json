  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive explanation of how signs and miracles serve to validate God's message through the works of Jesus and the apostles. They effectively use specific biblical references to support their points and emphasize the importance of faith based on the Word of God. However, the student could have further connected the importance of faith with the role of signs and miracles in strengthening believers' convictions. Additionally, while the student mentions that faith should not rely solely on miracles, they could have delved deeper into the tension between faith and signs in the process of God's revelation. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic with room for slight improvement in connecting the faith-signs relationship."
