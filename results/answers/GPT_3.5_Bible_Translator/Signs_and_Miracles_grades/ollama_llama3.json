  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response thoroughly explores the role of signs and miracles in validating God's power and authority, citing relevant biblical passages such as John 10:37-38 and Acts 2:22. The writer also correctly emphasizes that while signs and miracles can confirm the truth of God's message, faith ultimately rests on the Word of God (John 20:29). Additionally, the response acknowledges Jesus' warning against seeking signs for the sake of signs (John 4:48).\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is in providing a more nuanced discussion of the relationship between faith and signs. While it is true that faith does not ultimately rest on miracles alone, the writer could have explored this topic further by considering how signs and miracles can be used to deepen and confirm one's faith.\n\nOverall, however, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical teaching on signs and miracles and their role in God's revelation."
