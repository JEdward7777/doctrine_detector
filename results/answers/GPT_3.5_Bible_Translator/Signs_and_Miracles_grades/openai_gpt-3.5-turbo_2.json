It addresses the concern by examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation through referencing key biblical passages and emphasizing the importance of faith based on the Word of God. The integration of relevant scripture and the acknowledgment of the primary role of the Gospel in transforming hearts enhance the depth of understanding from a Christian worldview."
