It effectively articulates how signs and miracles serve as validations of God's power and authority, aligning with a Christian worldview. The clear integration of relevant scriptural references enhances the argument made in the response. Additionally, the inclusion of Jesus' caution against seeking signs for the sake of signs and the emphasis on faith based on the Word of God further strengthens the theological perspective."
