It highlights the importance of signs and miracles as validations of God's power and authority, providing biblical examples to support the argument. Additionally, it emphasizes the deeper significance of faith grounded in the Word of God as the ultimate foundation for belief. Overall, a strong and well-supported explanation within a Christian theological framework."
