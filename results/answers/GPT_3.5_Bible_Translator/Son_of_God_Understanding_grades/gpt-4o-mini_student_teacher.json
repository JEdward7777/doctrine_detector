  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid explanation of the term 'Son of God' in Christian theology, emphasizing Jesus' divinity and his unique relationship with God the Father. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the eternal nature of Jesus' relationship with the Father and the implications of his divinity in the context of the Trinity. The reference answer highlights the essential aspect of Jesus being fully God, which the student's response could have emphasized more clearly."
