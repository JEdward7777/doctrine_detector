It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' full divinity and eternal relationship with God, while also delving into the concept of the Trinity. The only slight room for improvement could be to directly tie back the explanation to the initial statement that \"The term 'Son of God' refers to Jesus, who is fully God and shares the same nature as God the Father.\""
