  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" as it refers to Jesus and the term \"sons of God\" used for believers. The response effectively highlighted the unique and special significance of Jesus as the Son of God in comparison to believers, emphasizing their nature and essence. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and straightforward to align closely with the reference answer for better clarity in theological discussions."
