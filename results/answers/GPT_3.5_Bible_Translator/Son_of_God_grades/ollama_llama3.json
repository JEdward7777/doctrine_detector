  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the distinction between \"Son of God\" referring to Jesus and \"sons of God\" referring to believers, which aligns with the concern about avoiding confusion in theological discussions. It also attempts to provide some explanation for why these terms have different meanings.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more depth and detail on the nature and essence of each term. The provided explanation is somewhat superficial and lacks biblical support or theological nuance. Additionally, the response does not fully address the concern about avoiding confusion, as it only touches on the issue without providing a clear and thorough solution.\n\nComment: While this response has some good points, it could be strengthened by delving deeper into the theological significance of these terms and providing more explicit connections to biblical passages and Christian theology."
