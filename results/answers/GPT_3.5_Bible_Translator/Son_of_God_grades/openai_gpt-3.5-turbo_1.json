  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the distinction between Jesus as the Son of God and believers as sons of God, aligning well with the given answer and addressing the concern raised. The explanations are clear, supported by Christian theological understanding, and effectively differentiate the unique significance of each term. Some minor improvements could include further integration of scriptural references to strengthen the theological foundation. Overall, a strong response."
