  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and clear explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" for Jesus and the term \"sons of God\" for believers. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the unique and specific nature of Jesus as the Son of God and the broader application to believers. The response is well-written and demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological significance of these terms from a Christian worldview."
