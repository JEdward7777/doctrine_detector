It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the unique and special significance of the title \"Son of God\" when referring to Jesus, while also highlighting the broader application of \"sons of God\" to believers. The explanation is thorough and aligns well with a Christian worldview, demonstrating a solid understanding of the theological implications of these titles."
