## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "sons of God" in the context of Genesis 6 has been the subject of various interpretations among biblical scholars and theologians. Here are the main interpretations:

1. Angelic Interpretation: Some scholars interpret the "sons of God" in Genesis 6 as referring to angels who cohabited with human women, resulting in the birth of the Nephilim, who were believed to be giant and powerful beings. This interpretation is based on passages in the Old Testament and non-biblical Jewish literature that suggest the existence of supernatural beings who interacted with humans.

2. Sethite Interpretation: Another interpretation is that the "sons of God" were the descendants of Seth, who was the faithful son of Adam and Eve. According to this view, the term "sons of God" refers to the righteous line of Seth intermarrying with the ungodly line of Cain, which led to a deterioration of morality and the rise of wickedness in the world.

3. Human Rulers Interpretation: Some scholars suggest that the "sons of God" were ancient rulers or kings who exerted authority over their subjects and engaged in oppressive and tyrannical behavior, contributing to the corruption and violence prevalent in the pre-Flood world.

Ultimately, the precise identity of the "sons of God" in Genesis 6 remains a matter of debate, and different interpretations have been proposed over the centuries. It is important to interpret this passage in light of the broader biblical narrative and theological themes, such as the nature of sin, the consequences of disobedience, and the need for redemption through Christ.
