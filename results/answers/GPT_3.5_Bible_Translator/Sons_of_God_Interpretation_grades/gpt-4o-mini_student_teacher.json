  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in the context of Genesis 6, showing a good understanding of the various perspectives. The answer also highlighted the importance of interpreting biblical passages within the broader theological themes, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. The only improvement could be to provide a clearer connection between the interpretations given and the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a solid response demonstrating knowledge and critical thinking."
