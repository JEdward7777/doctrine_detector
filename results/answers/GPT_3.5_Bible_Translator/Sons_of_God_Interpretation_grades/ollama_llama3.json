  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a general overview of different interpretations of the \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, which aligns with the concern of understanding biblical interpretation. It mentions three main interpretations: angelic, Sethite, and human rulers. However, it does not delve deeper into each interpretation or provide specific biblical evidence to support these views.\n\nThe response is concise and easy to follow, but it could be more detailed and nuanced in its discussion of different perspectives. Additionally, the answer could have provided a clearer connection between the different interpretations and the broader biblical narrative and theological themes.\n\nOverall, while this response provides a good starting point for understanding biblical interpretation, it could be improved with more depth and analysis."
