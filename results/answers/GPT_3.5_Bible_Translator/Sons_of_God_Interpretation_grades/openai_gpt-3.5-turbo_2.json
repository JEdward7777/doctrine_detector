However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on presenting a clear stance on which interpretation the author finds most compelling or persuasive based on Christian theological principles. Additionally, tying these interpretations back to key Christian teachings such as the fall of humanity and the need for redemption through Christ would have further strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
