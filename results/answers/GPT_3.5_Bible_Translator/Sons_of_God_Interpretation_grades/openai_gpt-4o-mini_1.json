  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the various interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. The discussion of how different interpretations impact the meaning of the scripture passage aligns well with the concern about the importance of biblical interpretation. To improve the grade further, more direct references to specific biblical passages or theological principles could have been included to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
