  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer outlining the differences between spiritual and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. They have correctly highlighted aspects such as the source, purpose, accountability, and duration of authority for both types of authorities. However, the student's response lacks a direct reference to the specific biblical verse provided by the teacher in Ephesians 6:12, which emphasizes the spiritual authorities' role in battling against spiritual forces of evil. Integrating this foundational biblical reference would have strengthened the student's answer and provided a more focused perspective from a Christian worldview."
