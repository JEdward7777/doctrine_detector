The implications of spiritual gifts are significant for Christians. They are given for the common good of the church and are intended to be used to edify, encourage, and strengthen believers, as well as to reach out to those who do not know Christ. Each believer has been given at least one spiritual gift, and it is important for them to identify and cultivate their gifts to be effective in their role within the body of Christ.
