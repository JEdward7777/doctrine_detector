They are given for the common good of the church and are intended to be used to edify, encourage, and strengthen believers, as well as to reach out to those who do not know Christ. Each believer has been given at least one spiritual gift, and it is important for them to identify and cultivate their gifts to be effective in their role within the body of Christ.

Furthermore, spiritual gifts are not given for personal glory or self-promotion, but are to be used humbly and in accordance with God's will. They are meant to be exercised in love, in unity, and for the benefit of all believers. Christians are called to steward their spiritual gifts well and to seek to use them in a way that brings honor and glory to God.
