  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as an 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of how confessing sins to one another contributes to spiritual healing based on humility, accountability, intimacy, vulnerability, and the power of confession and forgiveness, they could have focused more directly on the importance of community in spiritual growth as specified in the concern. The student's answer could have been improved by emphasizing the role of the body of Christ and the aspect of community in fostering accountability, support, and encouragement, as highlighted in the reference answer.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and provided a well-reasoned response, but could have aligned more closely with the specific concern provided."
