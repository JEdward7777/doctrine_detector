  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 90/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the spiritual significance of the 'circumcision of the heart' in a Christian context. The student clearly articulates the transition from the physical practice to the metaphorical representation of a renewed heart. The connection to Paul's words in Romans is also appropriately referenced."
