It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the spiritual implications of physical practices in modern Christianity, highlighting the shift from physical circumcision in the Old Testament to spiritual circumcision in the New Testament. The explanation is well-supported with biblical references and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective."
