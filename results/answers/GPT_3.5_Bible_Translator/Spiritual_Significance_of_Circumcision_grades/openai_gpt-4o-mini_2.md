## [Answer](../Spiritual_Significance_of_Circumcision.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The phrase 'circumcision of the heart' is a metaphor used in the Bible to symbolize a spiritual transformation or renewal that occurs within a person's innermost being. In the Old Testament, physical circumcision was a sign of being set apart as God's chosen people, but in the New Testament, the concept is extended to include a deeper, internal transformation of the heart.

In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul talks about circumcision of the heart in his letter to the Romans (Romans 2:28-29), where he explains that true circumcision is not just an outward physical act but a change of heart brought about by the Spirit of God. This spiritual circumcision signifies a cutting away of sin and worldly desires, and a dedication of one's heart to God.

Ultimately, 'circumcision of the heart' represents a life transformed by the power of God, where one's thoughts, desires, and actions are aligned with His will. It involves repentance, faith, and a deepening relationship with God through Jesus Christ, resulting in a new creation and a life lived in obedience to God's commands.
