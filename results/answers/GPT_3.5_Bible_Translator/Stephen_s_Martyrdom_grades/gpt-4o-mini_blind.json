  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church and effectively communicates the challenges faced by early believers. It correctly emphasizes the martyrdom of Stephen as a testament to unwavering faith under persecution. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the theological implications and the courage displayed by Stephen in the face of opposition. The response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications of martyrdom in the early church and connecting it to broader themes such as the sovereignty of God and the fulfillment of prophecy. Overall, a strong answer with doctrinal correctness."
