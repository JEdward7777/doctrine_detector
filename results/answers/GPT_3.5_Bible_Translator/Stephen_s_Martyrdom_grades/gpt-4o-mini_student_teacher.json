  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response effectively captures the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church, highlighting the challenges faced by early believers and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. The answer provides a thorough explanation of the event, its implications, and the spiritual lessons learned from Stephen's martyrdom. The student's reflection on the cost of discipleship and the triumph of faith over adversity aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, to improve the grade, the student could have focused more on the specific connection between Stephen's martyrdom and the concept of discipleship and faithfulness in persecution as outlined in the concern."
