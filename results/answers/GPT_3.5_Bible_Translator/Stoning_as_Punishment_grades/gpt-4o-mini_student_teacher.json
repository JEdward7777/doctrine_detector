  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the practice of stoning for adultery in the Old Testament and properly highlighted the tension between God's justice and mercy in the context of the Mosaic Law. They effectively referenced relevant Bible verses and demonstrated an awareness of God's perfect justice and holiness, as well as His mercy and forgiveness. However, the student could further emphasize the transition in mindset from the Old Testament practices to the New Testament teachings of Jesus regarding forgiveness and mercy, as shown in the reference answer."
