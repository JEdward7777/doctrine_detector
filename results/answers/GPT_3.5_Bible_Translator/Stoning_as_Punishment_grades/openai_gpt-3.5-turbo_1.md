What does the Bible say about the practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery, and how does this reflect God's justice and mercy?

# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Old Testament, specifically in the Book of Leviticus, stoning was prescribed as a punishment for certain sins, including adultery. Leviticus 20:10 states, "If a man commits adultery with another man's wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death."

It is important to note that the practice of stoning was part of the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites under the Old Covenant. This law was given to set apart the Israelites as a holy nation and to bring order and justice to their society.

God's justice is always perfect and righteous. Adultery is a serious sin that goes against God's design for marriage and can have harmful consequences for individuals and families. The punishment of stoning for adultery was meant to deter this sin and uphold the sanctity of marriage.

At the same time, God is also a merciful and forgiving God. Throughout the Bible, we see instances of God showing mercy and compassion to those who repent and turn back to Him. Jesus, in the New Testament, demonstrated this mercy and forgiveness towards a woman caught in adultery in John 8:1-11.

Ultimately, the practice of stoning for adultery in the Old Testament reflects God's perfect justice and holiness, while also pointing us to the need for forgiveness, redemption, and grace found in Jesus Christ under the New Covenant.
