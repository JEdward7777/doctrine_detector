The additional information about the lampstand, table of showbread, and the items within the Ark of the Covenant enhances the understanding of the sacredness of the tabernacle and its importance in worship. The focus on the tabernacle as a sacred dwelling place for God among His people aligns well with a Christian worldview emphasizing the holiness and presence of God."
