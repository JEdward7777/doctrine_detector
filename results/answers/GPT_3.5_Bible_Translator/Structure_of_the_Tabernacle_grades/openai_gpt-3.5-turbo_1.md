## [Answer](../Structure_of_the_Tabernacle.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Old Testament, the tabernacle was divided into two main sections: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place (or Holy of Holies).

1. The Holy Place:
- The Holy Place contained the lampstand (menorah), the table of showbread (or bread of the Presence), and the altar of incense. This area was where priests would regularly attend to the lamps, the bread, and the burning of incense as offerings to the Lord.

2. The Most Holy Place:
- The Most Holy Place was separated from the Holy Place by a veil and housed the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments, a jar of manna, and Aaron's rod that budded. Only the high priest was allowed to enter the Most Holy Place, and that was only once a year on the Day of Atonement to make atonement for the sins of the people.

These sections of the tabernacle were designed as a sacred dwelling place for God among His people, with the Most Holy Place symbolizing His presence in a particularly intense way.
