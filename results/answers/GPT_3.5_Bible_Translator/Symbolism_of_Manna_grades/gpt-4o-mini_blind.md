## [Answer](../Symbolism_of_Manna.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "manna" symbolizes God's provision for His people in times of need. In the Old Testament, manna was the miraculous food that God provided for the Israelites during their 40 years of wandering in the wilderness. It was a tangible reminder of God's faithfulness and provision for His people.

In the New Testament, Jesus referred to Himself as the "true bread from heaven" (John 6:32) that gives life to the world. This metaphorical language highlights the spiritual sustenance that God provides through Jesus Christ. Just as manna sustained the physical lives of the Israelites, Jesus sustains our spiritual lives by offering Himself as the ultimate provision for our sin and spiritual nourishment.

Ultimately, the term "manna" symbolizes God's ongoing faithfulness and provision for His people, both physically and spiritually. It reminds us that God is always there to meet our needs and provide for us, just as He did for the Israelites in the wilderness.
