  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how manna symbolizes God's provision both in the Old Testament with the Israelites and in the New Testament through Jesus Christ. The answer effectively demonstrates the concept of recognizing God's ongoing provision in the lives of believers. However, the student's response could have been more concise and focused specifically on acknowledging God's care and sustenance for His people, as stated in the reference answer."
