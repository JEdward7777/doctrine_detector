The inclusion of how manna in the Bible represents both physical sustenance and spiritual nourishment is insightful. The response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing God's ongoing provision in the lives of believers by connecting the concept of manna to the continuous faithfulness of God towards His people. Well done!"
