## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The metaphor of the cornerstone is used in the Bible to illustrate the centrality and foundational importance of Jesus Christ in the life of believers and the Church. In ancient architecture, the cornerstone was the first stone set in the construction of a building, and it determined the alignment and stability of the entire structure.

When applied to Jesus and His followers, the metaphor highlights several key aspects of their relationship:

1. Foundation: Jesus is the cornerstone upon which the Church is built (Ephesians 2:20). Believers are metaphorically living stones built upon Him, and He is the source of their unity and strength.

2. Identity: As the cornerstone, Jesus defines the identity and purpose of His followers. They are called to align their lives with His teachings and example, knowing that He is their ultimate guide and standard.

3. Stability: Just as a cornerstone provides stability to a building, Jesus offers security and strength to His followers. He is the unchanging, dependable foundation on which they can build their lives and faith.

4. Rejection: The metaphor also emphasizes the rejection that Jesus faced. In Matthew 21:42, Jesus quotes Psalm 118:22-23, referring to Himself as the rejected stone that becomes the cornerstone. His followers may also face rejection or opposition for their faith in Him.

In summary, the metaphor of the cornerstone demonstrates that Jesus is the foundational and defining element of the Christian faith and the relationship between Him and His followers. Believers are called to align their lives with Him, finding stability and identity in their connection to the cornerstone of their faith.
