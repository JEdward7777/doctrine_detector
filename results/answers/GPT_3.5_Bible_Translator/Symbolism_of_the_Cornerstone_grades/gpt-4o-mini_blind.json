  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This answer provides a solid explanation of the metaphor of the cornerstone and its application to Jesus and His followers. The student effectively outlines the foundational, identity-defining, stability-providing, and rejection-facing aspects of this metaphor. The answer could be improved by further expounding on the salvific significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in building the Church and the ultimate unity believers have in Him. Overall, a well-explained response within a Christian worldview."
