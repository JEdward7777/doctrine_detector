  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation of the metaphor of the cornerstone and how it applies to the relationship between Jesus and His followers. They covered various aspects such as foundation, identity, stability, and even rejection, showing a strong understanding of the metaphor and its implications for believers. The student effectively demonstrated how aligning one's life with Christ as the cornerstone leads to unity, strength, and guidance. While the teacher's reference answer focused on the source of strength and reference point aspect of the metaphor, the student's response provided a more thorough exploration of the topic. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful interpretation."
