  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of expanding on the metaphor of the cornerstone and its application to Jesus Christ and His followers. The writer provides clear explanations of how the metaphor relates to foundation, identity, stability, and rejection, drawing from specific biblical passages. The summary at the end effectively ties together the main points, emphasizing the importance of aligning one's life with Jesus as the cornerstone.\n\nThe response does not fully address the concern about believers aligning their lives with Christ's teachings and example, but it does touch on this point in its discussion of identity and stability. A more direct exploration of how the metaphor can help believers achieve this alignment would strengthen the response even further.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively develops the meaning of the cornerstone metaphor and its significance for Christian faith."
