They made valid connections to Jesus teaching in synagogues and the concept of the \"body of Christ.\" However, their response did not directly address the concern of the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship. They could have strengthened their answer by explicitly tying in the idea of the community of believers coming together for worship and support as indicated by the term 'synagogue'."
