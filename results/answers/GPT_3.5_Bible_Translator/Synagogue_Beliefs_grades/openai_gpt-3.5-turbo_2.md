## [Answer](../Synagogue_Beliefs.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In addition to referring to a physical building where Jewish people gather for worship and study of the Scriptures, the term "synagogue" can also be understood in a broader sense in Christian theology. Jesus often taught in synagogues during his ministry, demonstrating the importance of gathering together for worship, fellowship, and the study of God's word. In this broader sense, "synagogue" can represent the community of believers coming together to worship and learn, regardless of the physical location. The concept of the "body of Christ" in the New Testament can also be seen as a spiritual synagogue, where believers gather to grow in faith, support one another, and worship God.
