  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90. The student effectively highlighted the role of synagogues as gathering places for worship, study, and community activities, as well as emphasized their significance in preserving Jewish faith and identity. Though the student's response contained more information than the reference answer, the additional context provided enhances the understanding of the role of synagogues in ancient Jewish worship practices."
