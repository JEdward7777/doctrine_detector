Synagogues in ancient times served as gathering places for Jews to worship, study the Scriptures, and engage in community activities. They were not intended to replace the temple in Jerusalem, but rather provided a local center for prayer, teaching, and social gatherings. Synagogues played a key role in the development of Jewish religious life and were instrumental in preserving the faith and identity of the Jewish people, especially during times when access to the temple was limited or prohibited.
