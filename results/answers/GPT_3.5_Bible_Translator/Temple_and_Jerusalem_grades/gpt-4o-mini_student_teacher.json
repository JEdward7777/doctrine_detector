  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer demonstrating an understanding of the term \"Zion\" and its association with the temple located in Jerusalem. While the student's response went into theological depth beyond the specific concern provided, they accurately conveyed the historical and spiritual significance of Zion in relation to the temple. Great job!"
