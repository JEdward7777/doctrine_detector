  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is expressed in both the Old and New Testaments. The explanation of the significance of the tabernacle in the Old Testament and the reinterpretation of the concept through Jesus Christ in the New Testament is accurate. However, the student could further elaborate on the sacrificial system within the temple in the Old Testament as a way to atone for sins and point towards the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Additionally, emphasizing more on the role of the high priest in the Old Testament and how Jesus fulfills that role in the New Testament could enhance the response. Overall, a well-written answer that demonstrates a good grasp of the topic."
