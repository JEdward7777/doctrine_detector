  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and insightful response that effectively explores the concept of God dwelling among His people in both the Old and New Testaments. They accurately highlighted the key scriptures and teachings related to the temple as God's dwelling place. However, the response went into more detail than necessary, potentially straying from the theological implications of God dwelling among His people. It could have further emphasized the significance of believers as temples of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament context, aligning more closely with the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic through scriptural references and explanations."
