The student clearly explains the physical temple in the Old Testament and its significance as a place where God's presence dwelt, and how this concept is reinterpreted in the New Testament through the person of Jesus Christ. The student's insights regarding believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit and the church as a whole being considered the temple of God are insightful and demonstrate a deep understanding of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people."
