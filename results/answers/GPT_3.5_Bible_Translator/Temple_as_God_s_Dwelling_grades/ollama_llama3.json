  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 70.\n\nWhile the student does mention some key points about the temple in both the Old and New Testaments, their answer lacks depth and breadth. They do not fully develop the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, which is the main concern.\n\nFor example, they do not discuss how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling place relates to Israel's covenant with God or the significance of Jesus' statement about destroying and rebuilding the temple. Additionally, they could have explored further the idea that believers are now the temple of the Holy Spirit, including what this means for their daily lives and relationships.\n\nOverall, while the student does provide some basic information, their response could be improved by providing more theological insight and analysis."
