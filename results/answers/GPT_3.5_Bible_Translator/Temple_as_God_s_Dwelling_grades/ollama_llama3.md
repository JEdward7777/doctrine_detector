In the Old Testament, the concept of the temple as God's dwelling place is expressed primarily through the construction and function of the tabernacle and later the temple in Jerusalem. In Exodus 25:8, God commands Moses to build a sanctuary so that He may dwell among His people. This tabernacle was a physical structure where God's presence was believed to dwell, and it served as a central place for worship and sacrifices.

In the New Testament, the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is reinterpreted in light of Jesus Christ. In John 2:19-21, Jesus refers to Himself as the temple, saying, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The apostle Paul also teaches that believers are now the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19), with God's presence residing within them.

Ultimately, the concept of the temple as God's dwelling place is fulfilled in Jesus Christ and His work on the cross, where He bridges the gap between God and humanity. Through faith in Jesus, believers become the dwelling place of God's Spirit, and the church as a whole is considered the temple of God (Ephesians 2:19-22). This spiritual temple represents the presence of God among His people, expressing His love, grace, and mercy.

I would grade this response a 70.

While the student does mention some key points about the temple in both the Old and New Testaments, their answer lacks depth and breadth. They do not fully develop the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, which is the main concern.

For example, they do not discuss how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling place relates to Israel's covenant with God or the significance of Jesus' statement about destroying and rebuilding the temple. Additionally, they could have explored further the idea that believers are now the temple of the Holy Spirit, including what this means for their daily lives and relationships.

Overall, while the student does provide some basic information, their response could be improved by providing more theological insight and analysis.
