It effectively connects the significance of God's dwelling place in both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing how Jesus Christ fulfills this concept and bridges the gap between God and humanity. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of how the temple represents God's presence among His people and expresses His love, grace, and mercy."
