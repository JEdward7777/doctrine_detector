In the Gospel of Matthew, chapters 4 verses 1-11, it is recorded that Jesus responded to the temptations presented by Satan in the wilderness by quoting scripture to resist each temptation. The three temptations were:

1. Turn stones into bread to satisfy His hunger - Jesus responded by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."
  
2. Throw Himself off the temple and test God's protection - Jesus responded by quoting Deuteronomy 6:16, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test."

3. Worship Satan in exchange for all the kingdoms of the world - Jesus responded by quoting Deuteronomy 6:13, "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve."

In each instance, Jesus relied on the truth of God's Word to overcome Satan's temptations, demonstrating his trust in and obedience to God.
