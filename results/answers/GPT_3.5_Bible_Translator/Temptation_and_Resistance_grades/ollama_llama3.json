  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' resistance to temptation in Matthew 4:1-11, accurately summarizing each of the three temptations and Jesus' responses using Scripture. The response also highlights Jesus' commitment to obedience and trust in God's Word.\n\nHowever, I would have liked to see more analysis and application of this passage. While the concern is about understanding Jesus' resistance as a model for Christians, the response does not explicitly draw out the implications for Christian living. Additionally, there could be more depth and nuance in exploring how Jesus' responses relate to our own spiritual battles.\n\nOverall, while the response is strong, it could benefit from more development and connection-making to make it truly compelling and useful as a model for Christian practice."
