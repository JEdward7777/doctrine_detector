## Question [Temptation and Resistance](../../../questions/Temptation_and_Resistance.md)
How did Jesus respond to the temptations presented by Satan?

## Correct Answer
Jesus did not give in to Satan's temptations and ultimately resisted them, showing his obedience and commitment to God.

## Stated Concern
Understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation provides a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil.

## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Gospel of Matthew, chapters 4 verses 1-11, it is recorded that Jesus responded to the temptations presented by Satan in the wilderness by quoting scripture to resist each temptation. The three temptations were:

1. Turn stones into bread to satisfy His hunger - Jesus responded by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."
  
2. Throw Himself off the temple and test God's protection - Jesus responded by quoting Deuteronomy 6:16, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test."

3. Worship Satan in exchange for all the kingdoms of the world - Jesus responded by quoting Deuteronomy 6:13, "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve."

In each instance, Jesus relied on the truth of God's Word to overcome Satan's temptations, demonstrating his trust in and obedience to God.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' resistance to temptation in Matthew 4:1-11, accurately summarizing each of the three temptations and Jesus' responses using Scripture. The response also highlights Jesus' commitment to obedience and trust in God's Word.

However, I would have liked to see more analysis and application of this passage. While the concern is about understanding Jesus' resistance as a model for Christians, the response does not explicitly draw out the implications for Christian living. Additionally, there could be more depth and nuance in exploring how Jesus' responses relate to our own spiritual battles.

Overall, while the response is strong, it could benefit from more development and connection-making to make it truly compelling and useful as a model for Christian practice.
