  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges that there are different terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, it only mentions two examples (\"communion\" and \"Last Supper\") and does not provide a comprehensive list like the original response did. Additionally, it does not explain the significance or theological perspectives behind these various terms, which is an important aspect of understanding the sacred practice.\n\nThe original response received a higher grade (60) because it provided a more thorough and accurate list of different terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, including their respective theological perspectives."
