Comment: The student provided accurate alternative terms that can be used to describe a deacon within Christian theology. However, to enhance the answer's depth and specificity, they could have mentioned terms like "diakonos" (Greek for servant), which is the root word for deacon. Additionally, connecting each term to its biblical or theological significance would have further strengthened the response.
