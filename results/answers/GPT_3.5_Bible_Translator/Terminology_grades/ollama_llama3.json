  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that there are alternative terms to describe a deacon, which aligns with the concern of recognizing various ways to identify service roles within the church. It also correctly highlights the role of a deacon as someone who serves and assists within the church community.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or explanations of how these terms reflect the role of a deacon. Additionally, while it mentions the term \"church servant,\" it doesn't explicitly connect this to Christian theology or scripture, which would further strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the response shows a good understanding of the concern and provides some relevant information, but could benefit from more development and depth."
