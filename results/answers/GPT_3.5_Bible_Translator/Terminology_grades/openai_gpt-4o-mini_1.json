  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively acknowledges the importance of recognizing different ways to identify service roles within the church by providing appropriate alternative terms for a deacon beyond just \"deacon.\" The terms \"church minister,\" \"church worker,\" and \"church servant\" align well with Christian terminology and accurately convey the role of a deacon in serving the church community. Well done!"
