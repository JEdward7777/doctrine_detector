  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid answer with a clear explanation rooted in biblical examples and teachings. They correctly highlight that testing God demonstrates a lack of faith, trust, and reverence. The reference to Jesus' response in Matthew 4:7 further supports their argument. The only improvement could be to elaborate further on the consequences or implications of putting God to the test. Overall, a well-supported and doctrinally sound response."
