  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive explanation of why putting God to the test is considered wrong, including references to Biblical examples and principles. They rightly emphasize the lack of faith, trust, and obedience involved in testing God, as well as the importance of acknowledging His sovereignty and goodness. While the student's response aligns well with the Christian worldview, it slightly misses the specific concern highlighted in the reference answer about taking advantage of God's mercy. Including this aspect would have further strengthened their answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic but could benefit from incorporating the specified concern more directly in their explanation."
