  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical principle that it is wrong to put God to the test, and provides some relevant examples from Scripture (e.g., the Israelites in the wilderness, Jesus' refusal to test God). The author also correctly identifies the underlying issue with testing God - namely, a lack of faith and trust in His goodness and sovereignty.\n\nThe response falls short of a perfect score because it could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation. For example, while the author mentions that testing God is a form of disobedience and rebellion, they could have fleshed out this point with more biblical support and application. Additionally, the transition between the Old Testament examples and Jesus' quote from Deuteronomy could be smoother.\n\nOverall, however, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of recognizing this principle in maintaining a proper relationship with God, which aligns with the specified concern. Therefore, I would give it a grade of 85.\n\nComment: The author's use of biblical examples and quotes adds strength to their argument, but could be further developed for maximum impact."
