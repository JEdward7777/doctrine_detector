  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the differences between testing and temptation in a biblical context. They correctly highlighted that testing is allowed by God to refine faith and strengthen believers, while temptation is an enticement to sin that challenges loyalty to God. The student effectively referenced relevant Bible verses to support their explanation. However, the student could have emphasized more strongly that temptation is not initiated by God, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a well-explained response with room for a slight improvement in aligning with the specific concern on God not initiating temptation."
