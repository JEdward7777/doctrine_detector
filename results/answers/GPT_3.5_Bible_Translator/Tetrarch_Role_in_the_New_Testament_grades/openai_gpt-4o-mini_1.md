## [Answer](../Tetrarch_Role_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, Herod Antipas, also known as 'Herod the tetrarch,' plays a significant role in several events involving Jesus Christ. 

One notable account involving Herod Antipas is found in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 23:6-12), where he is mentioned during Jesus' trial before Pontius Pilate. It is described that Pilate sent Jesus to Herod Antipas, who was in Jerusalem at that time, as Jesus was from Galilee, which was under Herod's jurisdiction. However, Herod Antipas did not find any fault in Jesus and sent him back to Pilate.

Another significant event involving Herod Antipas is the beheading of John the Baptist, as recorded in the Gospels of Matthew (Matthew 14:1-12) and Mark (Mark 6:14-29). Herod Antipas had John the Baptist arrested and eventually beheaded due to a promise he made to his stepdaughter Herodias, who had requested John's death.

Overall, Herod Antipas is depicted in the New Testament as a ruler who was influenced by personal relationships and political considerations, rather than upholding justice and righteousness. His interactions with Jesus and John the Baptist serve as examples of how earthly powers can sometimes be at odds with the Kingdom of God.
