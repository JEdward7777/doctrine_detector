  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student accurately referenced the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20 and explained its importance in the context of discipleship. The student's response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer but includes additional context which enhances the understanding of the mission of discipleship. Overall, a strong and comprehensive answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
