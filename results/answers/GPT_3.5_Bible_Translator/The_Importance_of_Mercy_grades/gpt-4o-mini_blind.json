The mention of demonstrating compassion and forgiveness as part of living out faith is also commendable. However, the answer could have been strengthened by elaborating on the Christian worldview perspective of God's mercy and judgment, tying it back to aspects of salvation and grace. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of mercy and judgment within the context of Christian doctrine would have further enriched the response."
