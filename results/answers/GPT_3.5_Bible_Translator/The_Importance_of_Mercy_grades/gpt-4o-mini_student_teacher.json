  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively explains the importance of showing mercy based on James 2:13 and its implications for God's judgment. The response correctly interprets the verse and connects it to the broader concept of demonstrating compassion and forgiveness in Christian conduct. However, the answer could have been more concise and directly focused on how mercy affects God's judgment without unnecessary repetition."
