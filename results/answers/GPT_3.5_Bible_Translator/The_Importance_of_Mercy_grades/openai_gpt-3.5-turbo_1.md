In James 2:13, it says, "For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment." This verse emphasizes the importance of showing mercy to others, as it plays a role in how God will judge us. Those who show mercy to others will themselves receive mercy in God's judgment, as mercy triumphs over judgment. Conversely, those who do not show mercy will face judgment without mercy. This principle highlights the importance of demonstrating compassion and forgiveness towards others as part of living out our faith in obedience to God.
