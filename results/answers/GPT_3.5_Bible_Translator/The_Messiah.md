## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Jesus" refers to the name of a person, specifically the historical figure known as Jesus of Nazareth who lived in Judea in the 1st century AD. The name "Jesus" is derived from the Greek name "Iesous," which is a transliteration of the Hebrew name "Yeshua," meaning "Yahweh saves" or "God is salvation."

The term "Christ" is not actually a name but a title. It comes from the Greek word "Christos," which means "anointed one" or "chosen one." In the Jewish context of the time, the title of "Messiah" (which is the Hebrew equivalent of Christos) was used to refer to the promised deliverer and king who would come to save God's people.

Therefore, when we say "Jesus Christ," we are acknowledging Jesus as the promised Messiah, the Anointed One who was sent by God to save humanity from sin and to establish His kingdom. Jesus is both the name of the person and the title of his divine mission and identity as the Savior and Redeemer of the world.
