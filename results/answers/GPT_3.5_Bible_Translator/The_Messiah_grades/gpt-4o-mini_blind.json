The student effectively distinguishes between the name and title, and articulates the significance of Jesus being recognized as the promised Messiah through the title of \"Christ.\" The explanation is doctrinally sound and demonstrates a good understanding of Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' identity and mission. Great job overall!"
