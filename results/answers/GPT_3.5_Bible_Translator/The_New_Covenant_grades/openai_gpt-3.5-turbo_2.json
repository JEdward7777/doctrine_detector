The explanation effectively demonstrates how God's law being written on believers' hearts under the New Covenant transforms their relationship with God, emphasizing internalization and personalization. The answer aligns well with a Christian worldview by highlighting the role of the Holy Spirit in enabling believers to obey God's commands willingly and demonstrating a genuine relationship with God based on love. Overall, the response eloquently addresses the concern while incorporating key biblical references and theological insights."
