  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the concept of believers being glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. They correctly explain that this glorification involves transformation, exaltation, and being made like Christ in his resurrection glory. They also reference a key passage from Romans 8:17 to support their explanation. The response is doctrinally sound and effectively conveys the significance of believers sharing in Christ's glory in eternity."
