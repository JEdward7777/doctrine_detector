  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as an 85.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive explanation of what it means for believers to be glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. They reference an appropriate passage from Romans 8:17 and emphasize the transformation believers will experience to be like Christ in His resurrection glory. The student also mentions the key aspects of this glorification process, such as being united with Christ in heaven, receiving new bodies, and being freed from sin and suffering. Overall, the student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer and effectively conveys the significance of believers being glorified with Christ.\n\nThe student could improve their response by further exploring the implication of believers sharing in Christ's sufferings as mentioned in Romans 8:17 and how it ties into their future glory. Additionally, connecting this concept to how understanding and embracing this hope can impact believers' faith and perseverance would have enhanced the completeness of the answer."
