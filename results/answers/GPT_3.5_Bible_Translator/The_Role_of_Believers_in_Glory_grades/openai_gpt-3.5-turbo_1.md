## [Answer](../The_Role_of_Believers_in_Glory.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of believers being glorified with Christ refers to the ultimate transformation and exaltation that believers will experience when they are united with Christ in heaven. This glorification is part of the process of salvation and involves being made like Christ in his resurrection glory.

One key passage that speaks to this concept is found in Romans 8:17, which says, "And if we are children, then we are heirs: heirs of God and co-heirs with Christâ€”if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory."

This verse highlights the idea that believers will share in Christ's glory, being transformed into his likeness and sharing in his eternal kingdom. Believers will experience the fullness of God's presence and glory, receiving new bodies and being freed from sin and suffering.

Ultimately, being glorified with Christ signifies the culmination of the believer's salvation, where they will experience the fullness of God's love and presence for all eternity.
