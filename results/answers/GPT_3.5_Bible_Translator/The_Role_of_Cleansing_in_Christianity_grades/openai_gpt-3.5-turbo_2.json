The incorporation of relevant Bible verses and the clear explanation of how the concept evolves from Old Testament practices to New Testament teachings showcase a strong understanding of the topic. The response could have been slightly improved by delving further into specific Old Testament practices that foreshadow or contribute to the understanding of cleansing in the New Testament."
