  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 85. The student effectively explains how figures like Moses and King David were chosen by God and highlights that God's selection process is based on His sovereign will and purpose rather than human qualifications. The student also emphasizes God's grace and sovereignty in working through imperfect individuals for His redemptive purposes, which aligns with Christian beliefs on God's transcendence and sovereignty. However, the student's response could have been more concise and focused solely on the aspect of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders as specified in the concern. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
