## [Answer](../The_Role_of_God_s_Chosen.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Figures like Moses and King David were considered "chosen ones" in the Bible because God specifically selected them to fulfill His purposes and carry out His plans. In the case of Moses, he was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and to receive the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. In the case of King David, he was anointed by God through the prophet Samuel to be king over Israel.

The fact that Moses and David were chosen by God implies that God's selection process is not based on human merit or qualifications, but rather on His sovereign will and purpose. God often chooses individuals who may be considered unlikely or unqualified by human standards in order to demonstrate His power and to bring glory to Himself.

Ultimately, the selection of individuals like Moses and David as 'chosen ones' highlights God's grace, mercy, and sovereignty in working through imperfect and flawed individuals to accomplish His redemptive purposes in the world. It is a reminder that God's ways are higher than our ways, and His selection process is based on His perfect wisdom and purposes.
