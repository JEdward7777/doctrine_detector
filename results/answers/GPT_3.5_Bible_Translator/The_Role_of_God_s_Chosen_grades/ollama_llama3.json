  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90.\n\nThe response accurately identifies that Moses and King David were chosen by God for specific purposes, highlighting God's sovereignty in appointing leaders. The writer also touches on the idea that God's selection process is not based on human merit or qualifications, but rather His divine purpose and plans. This aligns well with the concern about recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are:\n\n* The response could have delved deeper into the implications of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders for the Christian community. For example, it could have explored how this concept affects our understanding of authority and submission within the church.\n* While the response mentions that God chooses individuals who may be considered unlikely or unqualified by human standards, it does not explicitly develop this idea further.\n\nOverall, however, the response provides a clear and concise explanation of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders, and its implications for the Christian community."
