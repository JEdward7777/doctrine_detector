  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and well-structured explanation of the significance of the twelve apostles among Jesus' disciples. The answer correctly highlights key points such as their selection by Jesus, role as witnesses, leadership in the early church, and foundation of the Christian faith. The biblical references are aptly used to support the statements made. However, to enhance the response further, the student could have included a deeper discussion on the individual apostles and their unique roles within the group."
