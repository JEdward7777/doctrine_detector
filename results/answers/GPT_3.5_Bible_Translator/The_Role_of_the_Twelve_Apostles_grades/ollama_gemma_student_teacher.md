## [Answer](../The_Role_of_the_Twelve_Apostles.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The twelve apostles were significant among Jesus' disciples for several reasons:

1. Chosen by Jesus: The twelve apostles were personally chosen by Jesus to be his closest followers and to carry on his teachings after his death. In Mark 3:13-14, it says, "Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach."

2. Witnesses to Christ's ministry: The apostles were eyewitnesses to Jesus' teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection. Their role was to testify to these events and spread the message of salvation through Jesus Christ to the world.

3. Leaders of the early church: After Jesus' ascension into heaven, the apostles played a crucial role in establishing and leading the early Christian church. They were instrumental in organizing the community of believers, making decisions, and spreading the gospel message.

4. Foundation of the church: In Ephesians 2:20, it says, "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone." The apostles laid the foundation for the Christian church, with Jesus as the cornerstone, upon which the faith of believers is built.

Overall, the twelve apostles were significant because they were chosen by Jesus, witnessed his ministry, led the early church, and laid the foundation for Christian faith and doctrine.
