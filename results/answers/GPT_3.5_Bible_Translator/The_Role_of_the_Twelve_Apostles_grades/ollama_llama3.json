  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response largely aligns with the given answer, emphasizing that the apostles were significant because they were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and were tasked with continuing His teachings after His ascension. The additional points made about the apostles being witnesses to Christ's ministry, leaders of the early church, and foundation of the Christian church are also relevant and valuable contributions.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that this response could have been more concise and focused on the key point that the given answer highlights. While the additional details provided are useful, they somewhat dilute the main message. Nonetheless, this response effectively recognizes the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, making it a strong 90.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the twelve apostles in Christian faith and doctrine. It would be even more effective if it were more concise and directly addressed the concern about recognizing their importance."
