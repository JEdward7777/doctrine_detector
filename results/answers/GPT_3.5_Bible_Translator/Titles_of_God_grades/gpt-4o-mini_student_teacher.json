  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the title \"Almighty\" in the Bible, citing specific examples and contexts where it is used. They have shown an understanding of how this title reflects God's power and authority. However, the student missed out on important titles such as 'Lord Almighty' and 'Lord God Almighty' that were mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. This oversight slightly impacts the completeness of their response."
