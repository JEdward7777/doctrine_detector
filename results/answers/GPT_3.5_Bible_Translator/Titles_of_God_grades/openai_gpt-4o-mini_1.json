  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of titles from the Bible that refer to God as 'Almighty', demonstrating a good understanding of this aspect of God's character. The answer aligns well with the concern by emphasizing how recognizing these titles can enhance our understanding of God's character and attributes, particularly His absolute power and authority. Well done overall."
