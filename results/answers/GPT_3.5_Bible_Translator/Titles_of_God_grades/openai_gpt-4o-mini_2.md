In the Bible, God is referred to by several titles that reflect His absolute power and authority. One of the most commonly used titles that expresses God's omnipotence is "Almighty." This title emphasizes God's unlimited power and sovereignty over all things.

Some of the titles used in the Bible to refer to God as 'Almighty' include:

1. God Almighty (El Shaddai in Hebrew) - This title is used in the Old Testament to signify God's all-sufficient, all-powerful nature. It is found in Genesis 17:1, where God introduces Himself to Abram (later Abraham) as "God Almighty."

2. Almighty God - This title is used in the Bible to emphasize God's supreme power and authority over all creation. It is found in various passages, including Job 11:7, Psalm 68:14, and Revelation 19:15.

3. Almighty One - This title is used to describe God as the one who possesses unmatched strength and sovereignty. It is found in Isaiah 49:26 and Revelation 1:8.

These titles serve as reminders of God's infinite power and his ability to fulfill His promises and purposes.
