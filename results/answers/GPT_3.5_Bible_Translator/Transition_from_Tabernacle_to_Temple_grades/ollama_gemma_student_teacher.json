  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately explains the transition from the tabernacle to the temple from a religious perspective, highlighting the permanence and significance of the temple as a central place of worship. The connection between the tabernacle being a precursor to the temple is also correctly noted. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of the Ark of the Covenant and its placement in the temple, which would enhance the depth of understanding of the religious transition."
