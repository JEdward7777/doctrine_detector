The phrase "El Shaddai" is a Hebrew title for God that is often translated into other languages based on the specific cultural and linguistic context of the target language. In many English Bible translations, "El Shaddai" is commonly rendered as "God Almighty" or "All-Sufficient One." 

When translating "El Shaddai" into other languages, translators aim to convey the meaning of God's all-powerful and all-sufficient nature.
