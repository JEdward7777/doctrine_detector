  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of how \"El Shaddai\" can be translated into different languages based on cultural and linguistic contexts, they did not prioritize accurately representing God's name across different cultures as the primary concern. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes simplicity and phonetics in translation to ensure fidelity to the original term while the student's answer focuses more on conveying the meaning of the term across languages. The student did mention the importance of accurately conveying the original term within cultural contexts, which is a positive point. A higher grade could be awarded if the student had placed more emphasis on maintaining the integrity of God's name in translation."
