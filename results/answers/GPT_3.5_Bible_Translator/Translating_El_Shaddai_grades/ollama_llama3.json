  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that \"El Shaddai\" can be translated into different languages, which addresses the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across cultures and languages. However, it falls short in providing more depth and nuance to the translation process. The answer is overly simplistic, suggesting that the translation solely depends on phonetics and doesn't consider the cultural and theological context.\n\nThe response also fails to acknowledge the complexity and richness of the Hebrew term \"El Shaddai\", which is mentioned in the original passage. A higher grade would require a more thorough and accurate discussion of the translation process, taking into account the concerns of cultural sensitivity and biblical accuracy."
