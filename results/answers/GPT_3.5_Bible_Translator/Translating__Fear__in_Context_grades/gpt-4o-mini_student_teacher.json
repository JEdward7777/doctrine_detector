  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the different translations of \"fear\" when referring to God and how each conveys a slightly different nuance. They touched on the importance of understanding these nuances in shaping our relationship with God. While the student's answer was comprehensive and well-written, it slightly veered off from the teacher's reference answer by including additional nuances such as \"respect\" and emphasizing a balanced combination of attitudes. Overall, the student demonstrated a good grasp of the topic but could have aligned more closely with the specific concern of avoiding a distorted view of God due to misinterpretation of 'fear.'"
