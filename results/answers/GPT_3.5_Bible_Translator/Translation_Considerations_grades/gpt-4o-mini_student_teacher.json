  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 95. The student effectively explained the theological and prophetic significance of retaining the terms 'Zion' and 'Daughter' in translations of Biblical texts. They provided detailed explanations for each term and how they convey nuanced meanings and relational dynamics in the Scriptures. The student's answer aligns closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher but goes a step further by providing more in-depth explanations. Overall, this answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of retaining these terms for conveying the original text's spiritual and cultural significance."
