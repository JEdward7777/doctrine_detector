The student accurately presents common translations and their implications, highlighting the distinctions between \"image\" and \"likeness\" for humans and emphasizing Jesus as the \"exact representation of God.\" The answer effectively connects these translations to the theological truths they convey, showing a good grasp of the doctrinal importance of these terms. Well done!"
