  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtfully considered translations for the phrase 'image of God' when applied to humans and Jesus, and explained their significance well. The student's answers aligned with the concern of exploring the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. The only area for improvement would be to closely align their translations with the reference answer provided by the teacher to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the nuances within the Christian worldview."
