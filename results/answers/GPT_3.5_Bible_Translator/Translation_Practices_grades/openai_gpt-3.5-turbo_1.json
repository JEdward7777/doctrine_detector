  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does a good job of explaining the use of 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' in Bible translations to maintain reverence for God's name and historical traditions. However, it could have provided more specific examples or references from Scripture to strengthen the explanation further. Overall, the response addresses the concern of maintaining reverence for God's name while also highlighting the importance of clarity in translating sacred texts."
