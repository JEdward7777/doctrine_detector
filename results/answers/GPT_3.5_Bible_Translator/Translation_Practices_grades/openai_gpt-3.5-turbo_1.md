# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The use of 'LORD' in place of 'Yahweh' in many Bible translations is a common practice known as the divine name replacement. This practice dates back to ancient Jewish tradition of not pronouncing the divine name out of reverence and respect. Instead of saying 'Yahweh,' the Jewish people would say 'Adonai,' which translates to 'LORD' in English.

In the Christian tradition, this practice was also adopted to show respect and reverence for the name of God. Using 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' serves as a way to honor God's name and avoid any potential misuse or misunderstanding of the divine name.

While some Bible translations do include the name 'Yahweh' in certain passages, the use of 'LORD' as a substitute for 'Yahweh' has become more widespread in modern translations for consistency and tradition. Ultimately, the choice of using 'LORD' or 'Yahweh' depends on the translation team's theological preferences and the target audience of the translation.
