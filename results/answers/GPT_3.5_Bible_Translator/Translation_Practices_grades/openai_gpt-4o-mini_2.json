  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the use of 'LORD' in place of 'Yahweh' in Bible translations to maintain reverence for God's name, highlighting the historical Jewish tradition of not pronouncing the divine name out of respect. The explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the importance of clarity in translating sacred texts while upholding reverence for God's name. However, to enhance the response, it could have included a stronger emphasis on the theological significance and the scriptural basis for using 'LORD' as a substitute for 'Yahweh' in Christian tradition."
