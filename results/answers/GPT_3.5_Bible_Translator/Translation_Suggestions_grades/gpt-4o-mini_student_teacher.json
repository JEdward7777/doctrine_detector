  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out list of alternative translations for the phrase \"to be zealous\" that reflect its biblical meaning. The translations offered effectively convey the intensity and passion associated with being zealous in the context of the Christian faith. However, the student's answer could have been improved by including translations that closely align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, such as \"be strongly diligent\" and \"make an intense effort.\" Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept and provided relevant alternatives."
