  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: \nThis response provides a clear explanation of how the term \"Lord\" differs in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people in the Bible. The student effectively highlights the translation of \"Lord\" from Hebrew and Greek, as well as its significance in denoting God's sovereignty and authority, as well as authority over people. The explanation is doctrinally sound and demonstrates an understanding of the biblical nuances associated with the term \"Lord.\" However, to improve the response, the student could have included specific biblical examples to illustrate the usage of \"Lord\" in different contexts."
