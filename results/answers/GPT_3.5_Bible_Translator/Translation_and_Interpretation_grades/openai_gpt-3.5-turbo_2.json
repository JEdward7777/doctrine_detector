  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the different meanings of the term \"Lord\" in the Bible and how it can vary based on context. It correctly highlights the distinction between referring to God as \"Lord\" with a capital 'L' as a title denoting sovereignty, and using \"lord\" in a general sense to denote authority over others. The explanation aligns well with the concern about the impact of proper translation and interpretation on understanding scripture and God's nature. Overall, a strong and well-supported response."
