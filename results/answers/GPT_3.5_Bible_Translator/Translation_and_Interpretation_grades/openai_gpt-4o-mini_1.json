  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"Lord\" in the Bible, distinguishing its usage when referring to God versus ordinary people. The connection between the term being capitalized for God and translated differently for others is well articulated. The response acknowledges the importance of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms in understanding scripture and the nature of God, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The only room for improvement would be to provide a bit more detail or examples to strengthen the response further."
