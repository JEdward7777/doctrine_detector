  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student provided accurate potential translations of \"truly\" as used by Jesus in phrases like \"truly I tell you.\" The use of terms like \"verily,\" \"indeed,\" and \"assuredly\" effectively conveys the gravity and certainty of Jesus' words. However, the answer could be improved by including a brief explanation of how these translations capture the essence of the original Greek word \"\u1f00\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\" and its significance in biblical context. Overall, a solid response."
