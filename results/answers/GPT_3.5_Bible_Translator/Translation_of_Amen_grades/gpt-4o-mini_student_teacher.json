  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful potential translations of \"truly\" in a biblical context and demonstrated a good understanding of conveying the seriousness of Jesus' words. However, the translation provided by the teacher offers a more direct and accurate rendering of the term, emphasizing sincerity and truthfulness, which the student's answer did not fully capture. Overall, the student's response was on the right track but could have been improved by aligning more closely with the reference answer."
