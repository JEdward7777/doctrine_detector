One potential translation of "truly" as used by Jesus in phrases like "truly I tell you" could be "verily." This is a more archaic term that carries a similar meaning of emphasizing the truth and importance of what is being said. Another potential translation could be "indeed" or "assuredly," both of which convey a sense of certainty and authority in the statement that follows. Ultimately, the goal of translating these phrases is to convey the seriousness and truthfulness of Jesus' words to his listeners.
