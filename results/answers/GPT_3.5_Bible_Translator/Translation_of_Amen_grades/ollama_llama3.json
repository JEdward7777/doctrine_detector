  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides some useful information about potential translations of Jesus' phrases, including \"truly\" and its connotations of emphasizing truth and importance. However, it does not directly address the concern of understanding the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation, nor does it demonstrate a clear understanding of the impact of accurate translation on the authority and meaning of Scripture.\n\nThe given answer is not explicitly discussed in the response, which could have been an opportunity to provide further insight into the importance of accurate translation. Overall, while the response provides some helpful information, it falls short of fully addressing the concern and demonstrating a deep understanding of its significance."
