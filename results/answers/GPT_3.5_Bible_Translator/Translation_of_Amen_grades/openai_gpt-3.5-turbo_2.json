  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough analysis of potential translations for the term \"truly\" as used by Jesus, considering both \"verily,\" \"indeed,\" and \"assuredly.\" The suggested translations, 'Yes, I tell you sincerely' or 'What I am telling you is true,' align well with capturing the seriousness and truthfulness of Jesus' words. However, it could have further emphasized the significance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation in conveying the full depth of Jesus' message. Overall, a strong response with room for a slight improvement in connecting the importance of accurate translation with the impact on biblical interpretation."
