The references to biblical imagery and theological significance enhance the understanding of the term. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the doctrinal implications of the translations, such as the ecclesiology of the church as the body of Christ and the significance of believers gathering as the assembly of the faithful. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological exploration."
