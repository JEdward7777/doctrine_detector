  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided comprehensive and thoughtful translations for the term 'church', highlighting different aspects of its meaning. However, they did not address the concern of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature in translations as specified. The translations offered do convey aspects of unity, fellowship, and community within the church, but they do not explicitly emphasize the inclusion of all believers as the reference answer suggests. The student's answer would benefit from including translations that explicitly communicate the inclusive nature of the church, ensuring that the term encompasses all believers and not just a specific group."
