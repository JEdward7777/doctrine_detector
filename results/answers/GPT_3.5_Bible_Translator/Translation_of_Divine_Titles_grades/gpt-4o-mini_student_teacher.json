  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response that considered the theological significance of the term 'Lord Yahweh' in different languages and emphasized the importance of remaining faithful to the original Hebrew text. They also highlighted the need for translators to consider the theological implications and provide explanatory notes, which aligns with the concern about conveying the accurate meaning of God's titles in Scripture. However, the student could improve their answer by incorporating the teacher's reference answer regarding the specific translations of 'Lord Yahweh' as 'Lord God' or 'God who is the Lord' and emphasizing the importance of maintaining grammatical structure in the target language."
