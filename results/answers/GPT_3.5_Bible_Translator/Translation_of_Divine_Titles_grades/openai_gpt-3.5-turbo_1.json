The emphasis on maintaining the meaning of God's titles and presence in Scripture is clear. The suggested translations align well with conveying the theological implications of the original Hebrew text. The only area for improvement could be to delve deeper into specific examples of how grammatical structure in the target language can affect the translation to further enhance understanding for translators. Overall, a strong and well-articulated response that effectively addresses the concern raised."
