  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the meanings and contexts of 'Hades' and 'Sheol' and offered some suitable translation options, they could have been more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student included some accurate translations but also included phrases like 'the unseen realm,' which may not directly correspond to the biblical meanings of 'Hades' and 'Sheol.' Thus, there is room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with the precise translation options given in the reference answer."
