  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the original biblical languages and their cultural and theological implications. It provides clear explanations of the meanings of 'Hades' and 'Sheol', as well as possible translation options that are faithful to the original contexts. The concern about ensuring accurate biblical representation in translations is also addressed, with the suggestion that choosing reliable translations can help preserve deeper theological truths for modern readers.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples of how different translations might impact our understanding of the afterlife as portrayed in the Bible. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the importance of considering cultural and theological implications, it could delve deeper into the significance of these factors in shaping our understanding of the text.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good grasp of the issues involved in translating biblical terms, but could be taken to an even higher level with more specific examples and analysis."
