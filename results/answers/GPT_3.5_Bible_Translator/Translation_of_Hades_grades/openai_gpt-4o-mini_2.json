  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of accurate biblical representation in translations for ensuring greater understanding among believers. The suggested translations provided align well with the concern raised, and the explanation given shows careful consideration of the cultural and theological implications of the original biblical languages. However, the response could have been strengthened by providing a bit more depth or explanation for why these specific translations are reliable and how they enhance the understanding of 'Hades' and 'Sheol' in their respective contexts."
