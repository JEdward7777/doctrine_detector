  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer exploring various translations of the term \"Holy One\" in different languages. They demonstrated an awareness of the importance of capturing the theological implications in translations. However, the student could have further emphasized the necessity of retaining the meaning of holiness in translations, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding of the translation process and theological implications is evident in the response."
