It appropriately emphasizes the significance of retaining the meaning of holiness and consulting with native speakers and scholars to ensure the translation reflects the original biblical concept. The explanation could be strengthened by including more specific examples or references to Christian theological teachings on holiness. Overall, a well-informed and thoughtful response from a Christian worldview perspective."
