  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as an 85.\n\nThe student correctly identifies the term \"predestined\" and provides alternative translations that are commonly used in theological discussions. They also appropriately connect these alternative translations to the concept of divine foreknowledge and sovereignty. However, to improve their grade, the student could have further emphasized the biblical context in which these alternative translations are used and how they align with the overall biblical teaching on predestination. Additionally, a brief explanation of the theological implications of these alternative translations would have strengthened the answer."
