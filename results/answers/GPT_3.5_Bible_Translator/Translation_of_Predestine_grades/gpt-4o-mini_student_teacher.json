  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided good alternative translations for the term \"predestined\" that align with a Christian worldview, emphasizing divine foreknowledge and sovereignty. However, the teacher's answer offers more precise and contextually accurate translations. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept but could improve by focusing more on translations that directly reflect the biblical context."
