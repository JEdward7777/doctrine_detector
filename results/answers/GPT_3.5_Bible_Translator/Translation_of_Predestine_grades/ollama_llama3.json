The provided alternative translations also show an effort to convey the idea of divine sovereignty and foreknowledge. However, the original answer's translation suggestions (\"decided long ago\", \"planned ahead of time\", or \"decided beforehand\") are not as accurate or comprehensive as those offered in the response. Specifically, the response's alternatives (\"appointed beforehand\", \"chosen beforehand\", \"predetermined\", or \"foreordained\") better capture the nuances and complexities of the concept.\n\nTo improve, the original answer could provide more specific and detailed translations that accurately convey the biblical concept of predestination."
