  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a good overview of the considerations when translating the term 'Rabbi' into various languages within the Christian context. It mentions the importance of conveying the title's meaning accurately while reflecting the honor and authority associated with the term. The response also touches on the theological implications and the need for clear and meaningful translation. However, to improve the grade, the answer could have delved deeper into how the term 'Rabbi' specifically relates to Christian beliefs, emphasizing Jesus as the ultimate Rabbi and the uniqueness of His teachings. Furthermore, discussing potential challenges or controversies in translation could have added more depth to the response."
