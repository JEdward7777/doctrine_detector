  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response that demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of accurately representing Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith while considering cultural and linguistic nuances. The answer effectively addresses the concern of ensuring the significance of the title 'Rabbi' is respected and reflects the authority attributed to Jesus. The only slight deduction is for not directly mentioning the importance of not implying that Jesus was merely a schoolteacher, as highlighted in the reference answer."
