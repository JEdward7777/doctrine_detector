  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural and historical significance of the term \"Rabbi\" within the Christian context, including its association with Jesus as a respected teacher and leader. The discussion of transliteration, borrowing, or providing descriptive translations is also relevant to the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching.\n\nThe response aligns well with the desired answer, which emphasizes respecting the title's significance without implying that Jesus was just a schoolteacher, and conforming to how teachers are typically addressed in the target language. The added consideration of theological implications is also commendable.\n\nHowever, I would have liked to see more explicit connection between the translation process and Jesus' role as a teacher within Christian faith. While the response mentions conveying \"the respect and authority attributed to Jesus,\" it could be further developed to provide specific examples or biblical references that illustrate this concern. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic but could benefit from a more explicit connection between the translation process and Jesus' role as a teacher within Christian faith."
