  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-thought-out approach to translating the term 'Rabbi' while considering the cultural and historical significance within the Christian context. The emphasis on accurately representing Jesus' role as a teacher in Christian faith is noted and addressed effectively. The response could be improved by further connecting the translation choices to the theological implications of Jesus as 'Rabbi' in Christian theology."
