It appropriately addresses the concern of ensuring the accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more explicit references to biblical passages or Christian doctrines that support the significance of 'Rabbi' in relation to Jesus as a teacher in the faith."
