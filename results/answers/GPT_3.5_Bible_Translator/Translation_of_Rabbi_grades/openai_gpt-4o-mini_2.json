The explanation is well-rounded and highlights the importance of conveying both the honor and authority associated with the term while being culturally sensitive. To improve, the response could explicitly connect the theological implications of the term 'Rabbi' to Jesus' divinity and unique role as the Son of God, further reinforcing the significance within Christian faith."
