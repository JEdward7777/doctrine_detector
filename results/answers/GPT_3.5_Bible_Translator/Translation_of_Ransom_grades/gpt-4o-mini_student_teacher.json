  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided accurate translations for the term 'ransom' in different languages, ensuring the theological concept is conveyed effectively across linguistic contexts. The translations offered effectively communicate the idea of a payment made to free someone from captivity. However, the reference answer from the teacher may have slightly more clarity and depth in emphasizing the action of making a payment to secure freedom. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the task at hand."
