It addresses the concern of accurately communicating theological terms across linguistic and cultural contexts by emphasizing the importance of choosing translations that maintain the core concept of a ransom as a payment for freedom. The response could have further connected the concept of ransom to Christian theology and redemption to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
