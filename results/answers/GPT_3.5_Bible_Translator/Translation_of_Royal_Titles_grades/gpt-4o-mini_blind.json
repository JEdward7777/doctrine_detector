  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 85. \n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of how the phrase \"Your Majesty\" can be translated in different languages within a Christian theological context. The response appropriately emphasizes the importance of using titles that convey reverence and honor when addressing God. \n\nHowever, the answer could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of titles used to address God in different languages, rather than just general titles of honor. Additionally, referencing specific biblical or theological principles related to addressing God with reverence could enhance the theological depth of the response. Overall, a solid effort but with room for improvement."
