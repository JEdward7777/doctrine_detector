However, the student could improve the accuracy and respectfulness of the translations by aligning them more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which suggests using terms of earthly royalty to address a ruler in the target language. Additionally, the student should emphasize the importance of maintaining reverence and honor in translations, especially when addressing God in biblical teachings."
