  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response provides some accurate information about translating \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, acknowledging that cultural and linguistic contexts are important considerations. It also suggests consulting with native speakers and theologians to ensure accuracy.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or explanations of how to translate \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, rather than simply listing a few options. Additionally, while it mentions the importance of reverence and honor due to God, it does not explicitly connect this concept back to biblical teachings or provide a clear theological framework for understanding the significance of proper translation.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates some understanding of the concern about ensuring accurate and respectful translations of titles in the context of biblical teachings, but could benefit from more development and clarity."
