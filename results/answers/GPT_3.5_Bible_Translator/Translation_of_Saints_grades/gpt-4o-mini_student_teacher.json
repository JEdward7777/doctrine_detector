  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that offers various translations for the term 'saints' in a way that is inclusive of all believers in Jesus. They also emphasized the importance of retaining the original meaning while considering the context and theological implications. However, the student's answer could be improved by directly addressing the concern of using inclusive language without referencing specific Christian groups, as the reference teacher's answer did."
