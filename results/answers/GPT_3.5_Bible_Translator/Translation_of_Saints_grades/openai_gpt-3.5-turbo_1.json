  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides appropriate alternative translations for 'saints' that maintain the theological significance of the term. While it addresses the concern of using inclusive language, it could further emphasize the importance of encompassing all believers in Jesus without excluding any specific Christian groups. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the translation considerations related to the term 'saints' from a Christian worldview."
