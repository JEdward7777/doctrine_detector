The emphasis on preserving the sense of holiness and sacredness associated with the term in Christian tradition is commendable. The answer could be further improved by providing specific examples or references to show how different translations may impact the understanding of the term \"sanctuary\" in modern contexts. Overall, a solid response that aligns well with a Christian worldview."
