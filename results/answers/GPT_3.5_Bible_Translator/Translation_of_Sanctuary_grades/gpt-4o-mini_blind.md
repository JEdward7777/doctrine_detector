The term "sanctuary" is often used to refer to a sacred or holy place where God's presence is believed to reside, such as a church or temple.

In modern translations, it is important to preserve the sense of holiness and sacredness that is associated with the term "sanctuary." This may involve using a word or phrase that conveys the idea of a holy place where God is worshiped and honored.

Care should also be taken to ensure that the translation accurately reflects the context in which the term "sanctuary" is used in the original text.
