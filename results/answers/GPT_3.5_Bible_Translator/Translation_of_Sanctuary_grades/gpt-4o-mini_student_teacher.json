They correctly emphasize the importance of preserving the sense of holiness and sacredness associated with the term. However, the student's answer could be improved by specifically addressing the concern of ensuring the translation accurately reflects the Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place, as stated in the reference answer."
