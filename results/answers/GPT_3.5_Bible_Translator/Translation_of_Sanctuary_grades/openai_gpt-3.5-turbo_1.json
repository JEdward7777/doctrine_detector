The emphasis on preserving the theological significance and context of the term is commendable. However, the response could have further elaborated on specific examples or strategies for achieving this accuracy in translation. Overall, a solid understanding and application of ensuring proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms are demonstrated in the response."
