It aligns well with the concern of ensuring the accurate translation of Biblical terms to maintain their original meaning. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention the need to convey the concept of worship and honor to God in the translation, as worship is a key aspect of the Biblical understanding of a sanctuary."
