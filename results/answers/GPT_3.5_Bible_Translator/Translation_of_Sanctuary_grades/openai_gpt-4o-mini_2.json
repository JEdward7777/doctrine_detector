It emphasized the theological significance and historical context of the term within Christian tradition. The response effectively addressed the concern by clearly stating the importance of accurate translation to preserve the original meaning of Biblical terms. The only minor improvement would be to further elaborate on how modern-day understanding and usage of the term \"sanctuary\" may differ from its Biblical definition."
