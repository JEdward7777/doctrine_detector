  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating the term 'Savior' in different ways, highlighting God's active role in the salvation of believers and His power and authority. The response effectively connects these implications to the theological understanding of God's grace, sovereignty, and ability to deliver. However, the response could have been strengthened by referencing the spiritual aspect of salvation in addition to physical dangers, as highlighted in the reference answer."
