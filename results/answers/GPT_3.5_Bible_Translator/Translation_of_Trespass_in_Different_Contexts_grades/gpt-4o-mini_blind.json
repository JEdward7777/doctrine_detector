  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the theological implications of translating 'trespass' as 'sin' or 'breaking the rule' within a Christian context. The student effectively highlights the difference in understanding interpersonal violations as offenses against others and ultimately against God. The response is well-structured, coherent, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian perspective on sin, repentance, and reconciliation. Great job!"
