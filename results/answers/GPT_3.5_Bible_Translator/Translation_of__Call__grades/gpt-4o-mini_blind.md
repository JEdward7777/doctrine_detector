One alternative translation of the phrase "You must call his name" in a biblical context could be "You shall give him the name." This alternative translation maintains the same sense of the original phrase while providing slightly different wording. It still conveys the idea that a specific name should be given to someone, as implied in the original phrase.

85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this response as 85.

The student accurately provides a plausible alternative translation that maintains the essence of the original phrase within a biblical context. However, to improve the response, the student could have expounded further on the significance of names within a biblical context and how the alternative translation aligns with biblical principles. Additionally, incorporating a relevant biblical example or context could have strengthened the answer even more.
