  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides an alternative translation that maintains the same sense as the original phrase, which demonstrates an understanding of biblical language nuances. It also acknowledges the importance of considering different wording in interpretation. However, it does not directly address the concern about emphasizing the act of assigning a name, which is present in the given answer.\n\nTo improve this response, the writer could have explicitly highlighted how their alternative translation aligns with the original phrase's emphasis on naming and its implications for biblical interpretation.\n\nComment: This response shows promise in understanding biblical language nuances, but could benefit from further development to more explicitly connect their idea to the concern at hand."
