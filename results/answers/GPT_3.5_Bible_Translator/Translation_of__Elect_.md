## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In older English Bible translations, such as the King James Version (KJV), the term "elect" is used to refer to those who are chosen by God for salvation, often in the context of predestination or God's sovereignty in choosing individuals for eternal life. However, in more modern English translations, such as the New International Version (NIV) or the English Standard Version (ESV), the term "chosen" is often used instead of "elect."

The impact of this difference in translation can affect one's understanding of key theological concepts such as election, predestination, and the sovereignty of God. The term "elect" may carry implications of a more exclusive or deterministic understanding of salvation, while the term "chosen" may be more neutral or open to interpretation.

It is important for Bible translators and readers to carefully consider the meaning and connotations of words in their original context, as well as how they are understood in contemporary language, to accurately convey the intended message of Scripture. Ultimately, the choice of translation may shape one's theological perspective and understanding of God's work in salvation.
