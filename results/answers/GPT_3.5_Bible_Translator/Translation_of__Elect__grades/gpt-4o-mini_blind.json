  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student gives a clear explanation of the difference in translation of \"elect\" in older and modern English Bible versions, highlighting the impact on understanding key theological concepts such as election, predestination, and the sovereignty of God. The answer shows good insight into the importance of accurate translation to convey the intended message of Scripture. However, a slightly deeper exploration of the biblical and theological implications of the use of \"elect\" versus \"chosen\" could enhance the response further."
