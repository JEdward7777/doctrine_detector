  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how the translation of 'elect' differs between older and modern English Bible versions and the potential impact on understanding Scripture. They also discussed the theological implications of these translations. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God as specifically requested in the prompt. A more direct connection to this concern would have strengthened the response."
