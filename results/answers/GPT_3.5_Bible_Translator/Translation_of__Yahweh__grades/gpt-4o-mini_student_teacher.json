  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of why some churches prefer to use 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' in translations, touching on tradition, reverence, and theological emphasis. The response demonstrates an understanding of the cultural and theological considerations at play. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of maintaining traditional translation practices to respect the original Hebrew text, as highlighted in the reference answer. Strengthening this point would have resulted in a closer alignment with the Christian-specific worldview concern provided."
