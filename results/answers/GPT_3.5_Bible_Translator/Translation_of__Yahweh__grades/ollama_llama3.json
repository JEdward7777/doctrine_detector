The response mentions that some churches prefer 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' due to tradition and reverence for God's holiness, which is a valid point. However, it does not critically evaluate the importance of using original names versus cultural practices. Additionally, while it notes that both terms refer to the same God, it could further explore the implications of using \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in terms of conveying God's sovereignty and authority.\n\nTo improve the response, the author could have more explicitly addressed the concern about original names versus cultural practices, and provided a more nuanced analysis of the theological implications of using \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\"."
