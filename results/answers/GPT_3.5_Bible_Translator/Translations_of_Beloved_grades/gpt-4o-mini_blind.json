  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThe student has provided a good range of translation suggestions for the term \"beloved\" based on the context of love. The alternatives such as \"dearly loved,\" \"cherished,\" \"beloved one,\" and others effectively convey the deep love and affection implied by the term. The only improvement would be to possibly include a brief explanation or example of how each alternative captures a different nuance of the term \"beloved\" in the context of Scripture. Overall, a solid effort."
