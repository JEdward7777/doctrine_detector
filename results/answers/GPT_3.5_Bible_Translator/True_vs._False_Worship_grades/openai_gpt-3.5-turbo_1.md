# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Worshiping God involves honoring and adoring the one true God who has revealed Himself through the Bible. This includes recognizing His attributes, His sovereignty, His goodness, and His love for us. Worshiping God also involves obeying His commands and living in alignment with His will.

On the other hand, worshiping false gods involves giving reverence and devotion to entities that are not the true God. This can include idols, false deities, or even placing anything else above God in our lives. Worshiping false gods is considered idolatry in Christianity and goes against the first commandment God gave to His people: "You shall have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3). Additionally, worshiping false gods does not lead to salvation and can ultimately lead to spiritual deception and separation from the true God.
