  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the criteria provided in the Bible for distinguishing between true prophets and false prophets. They have effectively elaborated on each criterion and supported their points with relevant biblical references. The focus on aligning with God's Word, examining the fruits of the ministry, consistency in messages, testing by other believers, and the importance of humility and character all reflect a thorough grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview. The response could have been improved by directly referencing the nature of teachings, as mentioned in the reference answer, but overall, this is a well-developed and insightful answer with a solid biblical foundation."
