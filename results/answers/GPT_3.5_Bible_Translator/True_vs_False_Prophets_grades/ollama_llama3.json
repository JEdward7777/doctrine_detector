  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive list of criteria to help distinguish between true prophets and false prophets, which aligns well with the concern about being able to discern true prophetic voices from those that mislead or misrepresent God's messages. The response also provides scriptural support for each criterion, which adds credibility and authority to the claims.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not explicitly state that one should rely on prayer, discernment, and a thorough understanding of God's Word to distinguish between true prophets and false prophets, as mentioned in the original text. However, this is implied through the mention of \"prayer, discernment\" and \"thorough understanding of God's Word\", which suggests that the respondent is aware of the importance of these factors.\n\nOverall, the response provides a clear and concise outline of the criteria for distinguishing between true prophets and false prophets, and does an excellent job of addressing the concern."
