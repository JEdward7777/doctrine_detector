  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This answer provides a thorough and doctrinally sound comparison between having hope in God and merely wishing for something. The student effectively highlights the source of hope, the role of faith and trust in God, and the eternal perspective that comes with having hope in God. The biblical references and the clarity of explanation contribute to the strength of this response. Well done!"
