  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response is excellent in distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking, aligning well with the concern. The writer provides clear and concise explanations of the differences between having hope in God and merely wishing for something, using scriptural references to support their points. The summary at the end effectively synthesizes the main ideas, making it easy to understand the key distinctions. The only area for slight improvement is that some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity or concision, but overall, this response provides a strong and biblically-grounded discussion of the topic."
