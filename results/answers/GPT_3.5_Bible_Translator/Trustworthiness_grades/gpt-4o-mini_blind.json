The student has provided solid scriptural references and practical applications for demonstrating trustworthiness in actions. The incorporation of verses from Proverbs and James, along with clear explanations, showcases a strong understanding of Biblical teachings on integrity and honesty. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps include a reference to Jesus' teachings on trustworthiness, as His words in the Gospels also provide valuable insights on the topic."
