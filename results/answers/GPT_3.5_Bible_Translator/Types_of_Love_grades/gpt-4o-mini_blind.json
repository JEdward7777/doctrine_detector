  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of how different forms of love, such as brotherly love and romantic love, fit into the biblical definition of love. The student effectively articulates the characteristics of agape love as the highest form of love and ties it into the discussions on brotherly love (philia) and romantic love (eros). The inclusion of Scriptural references and the emphasis on the need for all forms of love to be grounded in agape love is commendable. To improve, the response could provide a slightly stronger differentiation between the various types of love and how they can complement each other within the Christian worldview."
