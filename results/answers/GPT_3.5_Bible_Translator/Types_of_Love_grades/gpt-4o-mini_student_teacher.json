  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the different forms of love in the Bible and how they align with the biblical definition of love. The explanation of agape love as the highest form of love and the emphasis on brotherly love and romantic love are well articulated. The student effectively connects these forms of love to the principles of God's love. However, there could have been a more explicit connection between romantic love and God's principles, as well as a mention of the commitment aspect emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response with room for slight improvement."
