  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the different forms of love in the Bible, particularly brotherly love (philia) and romantic love (eros), within the context of agape love. It effectively articulates how all types of love should align with a biblical worldview, emphasizing care, commitment, and reflecting God's love. The only minor improvement could be providing a more explicit connection between the mentioned forms of love and the biblical principles."
