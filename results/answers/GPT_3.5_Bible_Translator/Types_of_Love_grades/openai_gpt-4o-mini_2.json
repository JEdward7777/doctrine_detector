  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the different forms of love found in the Bible and how they can align with the biblical definition of love, particularly emphasizing agape love. The inclusion of brotherly love (philia) and romantic love (eros) with references to biblical teachings shows a strong understanding of differentiating the types of love within a Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of ensuring that all forms of love align with biblical principles of care and commitment."
