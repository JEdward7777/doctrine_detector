In the book of Revelation, the ultimate antichrist figure is commonly understood to be the beast described in Revelation 13. This beast is a symbol of a powerful political leader who opposes God and persecutes Christians during the end times. He is often associated with the number 666 and is part of a satanic trinity along with the dragon (Satan) and the false prophet. The beast represents a system or power that is in direct opposition to God and seeks to deceive and lead people away from the truth.Ultimately, the beast and all who follow him will be defeated by Jesus Christ when he returns in glory to establish his kingdom.
