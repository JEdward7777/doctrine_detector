4. Witchcraft or sorcery: Engaging in occult practices or seeking supernatural power outside of God's will.
5. Pride: Considering oneself as greater than God or others.
6. Lying or deceit: God values truthfulness and honesty, so deceitful actions are seen as abominable.

8. Offering unholy sacrifices: Presenting inferior or contaminated offerings to God is considered abominable.
9. Injustice and corruption: Acts of injustice, favoritism, or bribery go against God's character of righteousness and fairness.
