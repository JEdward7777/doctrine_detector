## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Ephesians 1:5, it states that believers are predestined for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ. This means that through faith in Jesus, believers are welcomed into God's family as His children. Being adopted as a child of God signifies a new identity and relationship with God as a loving Father. Just as earthly adoption involves being chosen, loved, and provided for by the adoptive parent, in spiritual adoption, God chooses, loves, and cares for His children with infinite love and grace. Believers are given the privilege of calling God their Father, receiving all the rights and inheritance as His sons and daughters. This adoption is a result of God's sovereign will and predestined plan, highlighting His grace and mercy towards us.
