  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that accurately highlights the biblical perspective on adultery and its consequences on marriage and spirituality. They effectively referenced both Old Testament and New Testament passages to support their points. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern about the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality with more specificity rather than a general overview."
