  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: This response provides a solid explanation of what it means to be \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context. The student effectively touches on key theological concepts such as sovereign grace, God's role in salvation, and the centrality of faith in Jesus Christ. The biblical reference is appropriate and supports the explanation well. The response could be further enhanced by delving deeper into the biblical foundations of predestination and exploring different theological perspectives on this topic."
