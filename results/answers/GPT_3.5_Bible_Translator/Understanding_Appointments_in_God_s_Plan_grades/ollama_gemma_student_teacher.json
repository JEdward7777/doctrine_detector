  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context. They effectively articulate the idea of divine selection by God and the role of faith in receiving eternal life. The reference to the biblical passage in Acts 13:48 reinforces the theological basis for this concept. Additionally, the student clearly explains the emphasis on God's sovereign grace and mercy in salvation."
