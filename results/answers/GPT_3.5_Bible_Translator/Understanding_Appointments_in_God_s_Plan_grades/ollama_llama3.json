  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response accurately reflects the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, highlighting God's sovereign will and grace. The mention of faith in Jesus Christ as the means by which individuals receive eternal life is also consistent with Christian theology. The only areas where improvement could be made are:\n\n* The response does not explicitly state that this appointment is based on Scripture (although it does cite Acts 13:48). Adding a biblical basis for this concept would strengthen the response.\n* While the response touches on the idea of sovereign grace, it could benefit from more development and emphasis on the implications of God's elective choice in salvation.\n\nOverall, however, the response provides a clear and accurate explanation of being \"appointed to eternal life\" and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept within a Christian framework."
