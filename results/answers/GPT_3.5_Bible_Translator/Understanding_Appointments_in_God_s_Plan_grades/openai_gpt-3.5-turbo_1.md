# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Being "appointed to eternal life" in a Christian context refers to the belief that individuals are chosen or appointed by God to receive the gift of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. This concept is rooted in various biblical passages, such as Acts 13:48, which states, "When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed."

This appointment to eternal life underscores the sovereign grace of God in salvation. According to Christian theology, God, in His infinite wisdom and love, chooses to extend His offer of salvation to specific individuals, drawing them to faith and granting them the assurance of eternal life in His presence. This appointment is not based on human merit or effort but is a result of God's grace and mercy.

Ultimately, being appointed to eternal life highlights the foundational truth in Christianity that salvation is a divine gift received through faith in Jesus Christ, who offers forgiveness of sins and the hope of everlasting life to all who believe in Him.
