## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Believing in something typically involves having faith or trust in a particular concept, idea, or belief. This could be believing in the existence of something, the truth of a statement, or the effectiveness of a method or practice. 

On the other hand, believing someone usually involves trusting that a person is telling the truth or acting in a trustworthy manner. It involves having confidence in their character, integrity, or abilities. 

In a Christian context, believers are called to not only believe in the truths of the Bible and the teachings of Jesus, but also to believe in Him as a person - to trust in His character, His promises, and His ultimate authority as the Son of God. So, believing in something may be more about acknowledging a truth, while believing someone may involve placing personal trust in a relationship.
