  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response effectively distinguishes between believing in something and believing someone, providing clear explanations and examples. They correctly highlight the importance of both types of belief, especially emphasizing the significance of believing in Jesus Christ in a Christian context. The inclusion of the Christian perspective adds depth to the answer. Overall, well done."
