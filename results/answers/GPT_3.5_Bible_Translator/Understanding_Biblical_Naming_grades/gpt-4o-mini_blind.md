## [Answer](../Understanding_Biblical_Naming.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Luke, the verse that mentions "His name is called John" refers to the naming of John the Baptist, who was the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth. When Zechariah, John's father, was unable to speak due to his disbelief in the angel's message about the birth of John, he wrote on a tablet, "His name is John" as instructed by the angel (Luke 1:63).

Naming in the biblical context is significant as names often carried a deep meaning or prophetic significance. In this case, the name "John" means "God is gracious" or "God has shown favor," reflecting the miraculous circumstances surrounding John's birth and his role in preparing the way for Jesus Christ.

Therefore, when the Bible states "His name is called John," it signifies the obedience of Zechariah and Elizabeth in following God's instructions and the fulfillment of God's plan through the birth of John the Baptist, who played a crucial role in the preparation for the coming of Jesus Christ.
