  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid analysis of the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob based on the Biblical account in Genesis. The student correctly highlights the spiritual significance of the birthright and the consequences of Esau's impulsive actions. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Jacob's role in obtaining the birthright and the broader context of God's sovereignty in fulfilling His covenant promises. Additionally, reinforcing the importance of repentance and redemption in light of these events would further enhance the theological depth of the analysis. Overall, a well-explained and thoughtful response."
