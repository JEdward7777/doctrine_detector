  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that delved into the spiritual and relational implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob. They accurately highlighted Esau's disregard for the spiritual significance of the birthright and Jacob's cunning acquisition of it. The answer effectively showed how Esau lost his inheritance and honor as the firstborn, while Jacob gained these privileges, aligning well with the teacher's reference answer. The response could have been improved by including more direct biblical references to support the points made and by emphasizing the eternal consequences of Esau's impulsive decision in a Christian worldview."
