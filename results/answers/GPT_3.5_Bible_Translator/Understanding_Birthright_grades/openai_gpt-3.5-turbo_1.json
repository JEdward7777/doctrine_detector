The analysis is thorough, grounded in Biblical references, and highlights the consequences of prioritizing immediate desires over spiritual blessings. The response could further emphasize the redemptive aspect of the story in how God ultimately used Jacob despite his cunning means, showcasing God's sovereignty and mercy."
