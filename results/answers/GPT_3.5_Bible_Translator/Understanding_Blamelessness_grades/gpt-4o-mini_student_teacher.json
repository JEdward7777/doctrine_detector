  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer supported by relevant biblical references. They have also demonstrated an understanding of the distinction between being blameless and sinless in a Christian context. One area for improvement could be to further elaborate on the concept of obedience and honoring God in their explanation. Overall, a strong response reflecting a deep understanding of the topic."
