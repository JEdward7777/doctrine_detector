The definition of blasphemy is explained adequately. The emphasis on the importance of using words to build up others and glorify God is appropriate. However, a stronger connection could be made between blasphemy and the essence of denying the work and presence of the Holy Spirit. Additionally, the response could be enhanced by including more scriptural examples or elaborating on the concept of repentance in relation to speaking against God or others."
