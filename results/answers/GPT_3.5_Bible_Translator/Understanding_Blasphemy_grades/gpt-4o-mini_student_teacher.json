  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded answer that references relevant biblical passages and offers practical application for Christians. The response effectively highlights the seriousness of blasphemy and the importance of speaking with love and respect. Overall, a very strong answer, only minor room for improvement in directly incorporating the teacher's specific definition of blasphemy to enhance the alignment with a Christian worldview."
