  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 90. \n\nThe student has provided a solid understanding of the Biblical concepts of clean and unclean and how they can inform our understanding of moral purity. The answer correctly acknowledges the Old Testament laws on ceremonial purity and the metaphorical application to one's heart and actions in pursuing moral purity. The inclusion of Jesus' teachings on purity from the New Testament further enhances the depth of the response.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to potentially expand further on the transformative aspect of Jesus' teachings on purity and how it relates to Christians' daily walk in pursuing moral purity. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
