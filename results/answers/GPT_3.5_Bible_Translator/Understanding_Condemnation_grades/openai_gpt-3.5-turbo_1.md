## [Answer](../Understanding_Condemnation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In 1 John 3:20, it says, "For whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything." This verse speaks to the fact that our hearts, our own consciences, may condemn us when we feel guilt or shame over our actions or thoughts. However, the verse also reassures us that God is greater than our hearts and He knows everything about us, including our thoughts, intentions, and struggles. Ultimately, it is God's judgment that matters the most.

In Romans 5:16, it says, "And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification." This verse contrasts the consequences of Adam's sin, which brought condemnation and death to all humanity, with the free gift of salvation through Jesus Christ, which brings justification and eternal life to those who believe in Him. Condemnation is the result of sin and rebellion against God, but through faith in Jesus, we can be justified and reconciled to God.

In summary, the Bible teaches that condemnation is the result of sin and disobedience to God's laws. However, through faith in Jesus Christ and His sacrifice for us, we can receive justification and freedom from condemnation. God's mercy and grace are greater than our sin, and He offers forgiveness and salvation to all who repent and believe in Him.
