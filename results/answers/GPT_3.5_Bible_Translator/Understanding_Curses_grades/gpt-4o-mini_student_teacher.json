  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the consequences of cursing others based on various biblical passages, showing a good understanding of the implications of their words. However, they could have focused more directly on the specific concern raised, which was understanding the alignment of their words with God's teachings, rather than a more general overview. Additionally, the student could have tied their response back more closely to the reference answer provided by emphasizing the negative spiritual consequences of cursing as highlighted in James 3:10."
