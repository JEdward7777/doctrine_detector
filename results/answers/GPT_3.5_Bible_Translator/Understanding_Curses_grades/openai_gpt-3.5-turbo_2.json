  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively expands on the initial answer by providing additional biblical references (Proverbs 18:21, Matthew 12:36-37) that emphasize the implications of our words and their alignment with God's teachings. The inclusion of these verses strengthens the argument and demonstrates a thorough understanding of how cursing contradicts Christian principles. The discussion on the consequences of cursing, both in earthly relationships and in a spiritual context, is well-supported and aligns closely with a Christian worldview. The overall response is insightful and effectively addresses the concern raised."
