The connection between our speech and God's teachings is clearly articulated, demonstrating an understanding of the importance of aligning our words with the principles of love and grace taught by Jesus. The only room for improvement would be to include a more explicit reference to the need for repentance and seeking forgiveness in relation to the use of harmful words."
