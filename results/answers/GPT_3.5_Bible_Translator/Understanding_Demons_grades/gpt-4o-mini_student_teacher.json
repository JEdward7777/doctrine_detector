  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the term \"unclean spirit\" in relation to demons as described in Christian teachings. They have accurately described the nature and characteristics of unclean spirits and their influence on individuals, while also highlighting the significance of Jesus in casting out these evil spirits. The only minor improvement could be to directly align the student's response more closely with the teacher's reference answer in terms of conciseness. Overall, a strong and insightful answer from the student."
