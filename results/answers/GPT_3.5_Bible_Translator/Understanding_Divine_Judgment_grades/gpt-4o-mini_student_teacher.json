  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid response demonstrating an understanding of the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. They accurately cited relevant biblical passages and highlighted key differences between the two forms of judgment. However, the student could have expanded further on the concept of repentance as a key aspect of God's judgment, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a well-written and insightful answer."
