## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that God's judgment is perfect, righteous, and just. Psalm 98:9 says, "He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity." Romans 2:6-8 also states, "God 'will repay each person according to what they have done.' To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger."

God's judgment differs from human judgment in several key ways:

1. God's judgment is based on perfect knowledge and understanding, whereas human judgment is limited and often flawed.
2. God's judgment is always just and fair, while human judgment can be influenced by biases, prejudices, and personal agendas.
3. God's judgment is final and eternal, while human judgment is subject to error and can be overturned or corrected.
4. God's judgment is motivated by love and a desire for justice, while human judgment can sometimes be driven by selfishness or a thirst for power.

In summary, God's judgment is the ultimate standard of justice and righteousness, and it surpasses human judgment in every way. We can trust in God's perfect judgment to ultimately bring about justice in the world.
