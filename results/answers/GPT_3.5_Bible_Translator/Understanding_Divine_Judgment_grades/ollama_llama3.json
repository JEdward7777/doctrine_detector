The example from Romans 2 also effectively illustrates this distinction.\n\nWhile the response does not specifically mention that God's judgment is based on His righteousness and justice as mentioned in the answer, it does provide a comprehensive overview of the differences between divine and human judgment. This understanding demonstrates a strong grasp of the biblical concept and its implications.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have explicitly mentioned the connection to God's righteousness and justice in describing His judgment. However, this minor oversight does not detract from the overall strength of the response."
