  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a clear understanding of the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment, incorporating biblical references to support the explanation. The student effectively communicates how God's judgment is based on His perfect righteousness and justice, contrasting it with the flawed and biased nature of human judgment. Additionally, the response highlights the aspects of God's judgment as a response to sin and includes both punishment and a call to repentance. The only minor suggestion would be to directly address each of the points made in the initial response and provide a bit more depth in discussing the call to repentance aspect of God's judgment."
