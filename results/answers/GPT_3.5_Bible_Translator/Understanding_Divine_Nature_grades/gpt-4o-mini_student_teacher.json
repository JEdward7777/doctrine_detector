  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the term \"divine nature,\" touching on essential qualities of God such as holiness, omnipotence, omniscience, and attributes like love and righteousness. They effectively connect these characteristics to God's perfection, sovereignty, and unchanging nature. However, the student slightly elaborated more than necessary compared to the reference answer, which is why a deduction was made from the perfect score. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
