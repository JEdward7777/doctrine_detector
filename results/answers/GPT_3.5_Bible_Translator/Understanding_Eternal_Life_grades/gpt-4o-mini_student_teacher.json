However, the answer could have included more emphasis on the importance of obedience to God's laws as part of inheriting eternal life, as per the reference answer. Integrating obedience to God's laws alongside faith in Jesus would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of inheriting eternal life from a Christian perspective."
