  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical teachings regarding eternal life. The response accurately highlights the central role of faith in receiving eternal life through belief in Jesus Christ, referencing John 3:16 and John 17:3. Additionally, the student effectively explains that eternal life is a gift from God and not something that can be earned through human efforts, aligning with Ephesians 2:8-9. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of obedience to God's laws as a component of inheriting eternal life. The reference answer suggests that obedience is necessary alongside faith, and the student's response does not explicitly address this aspect."
