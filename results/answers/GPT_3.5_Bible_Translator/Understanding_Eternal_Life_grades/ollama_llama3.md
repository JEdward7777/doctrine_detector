## [Answer](../Understanding_Eternal_Life.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that inheriting eternal life is a gift from God that comes through faith in Jesus Christ. In John 3:16, it says, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." This verse illustrates that eternal life is obtained through believing in Jesus as the Son of God and savior of the world.

Additionally, in John 17:3, Jesus defines eternal life as knowing God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. This highlights the intimate relationship believers have with God through faith in Jesus, which leads to eternal life.

Ephesians 2:8-9 further emphasizes that eternal life is a gift from God that cannot be earned through works, stating, "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."

Overall, the Bible teaches that inheriting eternal life is based on God's grace, received through faith in Jesus Christ, and is ultimately a gift that cannot be earned through one's own efforts.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
95.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

This response effectively answers the concern about understanding how to attain eternal life, accurately citing three key biblical passages (John 3:16, John 17:3, and Ephesians 2:8-9) to support its claim. The response also correctly emphasizes that eternal life is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ, and cannot be earned through works.

The only area for improvement is the initial sentence, which could be strengthened by providing a clearer definition of what is meant by "obeying God's laws." While this phrase may be a common way to describe living according to biblical teachings, it could be further clarified or rephrased to better align with the Bible's teaching that eternal life is based on faith in Jesus Christ rather than human effort.

Overall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical teaching on eternal life and provides a clear and concise explanation.
