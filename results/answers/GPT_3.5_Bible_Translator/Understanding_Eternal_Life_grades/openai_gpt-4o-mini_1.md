## [Answer](../Understanding_Eternal_Life.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that inheriting eternal life is a gift from God that comes through faith in Jesus Christ. In John 3:16, it says, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." This verse illustrates that eternal life is obtained through believing in Jesus as the Son of God and savior of the world.

Additionally, in John 17:3, Jesus defines eternal life as knowing God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. This highlights the intimate relationship believers have with God through faith in Jesus, which leads to eternal life.

Ephesians 2:8-9 further emphasizes that eternal life is a gift from God that cannot be earned through works, stating, "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."

Overall, the Bible teaches that inheriting eternal life is based on God's grace, received through faith in Jesus Christ, and is ultimately a gift that cannot be earned through one's own efforts.
