However, the initial answer stating that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws is incorrect and deviates from Christian teachings that salvation is based on faith in Christ alone, not by works. A better understanding of the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for obtaining eternal life is needed for a higher grade."
