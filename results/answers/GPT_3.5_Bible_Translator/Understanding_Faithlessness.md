## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The term 'faithless' implies that a person lacks faith or trust in God. In Christian theology, faith is a central aspect of the believer's relationship with God. It involves belief in God's existence, trust in His promises, and reliance on His character. A faithless person would therefore be someone who does not have this trust and confidence in God. This can manifest in various ways, such as doubt, unbelief, or a lack of commitment to following God's will. In the Bible, faithlessness is often depicted as a failing that separates individuals from God and His blessings.
