## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites' perception of Gentiles played a significant role in their relationships with them in the early church. Initially, there was a deep-seated cultural and religious divide between Jews and Gentiles. The Israelites saw themselves as God's chosen people, set apart for a special relationship with Him, while the Gentiles were viewed as unclean, idolatrous, and outside the covenant relationship with God.

This perception resulted in a sense of superiority among some Israelites, leading to prejudice, discrimination, and a reluctance to fellowship with Gentiles. The Jewish dietary laws, circumcision, and other cultural practices further reinforced this separation between Jews and Gentiles.

However, the teaching of Jesus Christ and the early apostles brought a radical shift in perspective. The message of the gospel emphasized the inclusion of Gentiles into God's kingdom through faith in Jesus Christ, regardless of their ethnicity or background. This transformative truth challenged the existing prejudices and barriers between Jews and Gentiles within the early church.

Despite initial resistance and tension, the early church gradually began to embrace Gentile believers as equal members of the body of Christ. This was evident in the ministry of the apostle Paul, who played a key role in promoting unity among Jewish and Gentile believers and breaking down the dividing wall of hostility between them (Ephesians 2:14).

Ultimately, the early church's understanding of God's grace and the universal scope of His salvation led to a more inclusive and reconciled community, where Jews and Gentiles could worship and serve together as one body in Christ.
