  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles on their relationships with them in the early church. The student clearly articulates the initial cultural and religious divide between Jews and Gentiles, as well as the transformative effect of the gospel in challenging these prejudices. The inclusion of references to Paul's role in promoting unity further strengthens the response. Overall, this is a well-written and informative answer that aligns well with the Christian worldview."
