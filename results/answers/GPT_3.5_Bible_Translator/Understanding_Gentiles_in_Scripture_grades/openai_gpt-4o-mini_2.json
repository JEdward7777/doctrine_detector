The inclusion of scriptural references, such as Ephesians 2:14, and the acknowledgment of the transformative message of the gospel in breaking down barriers between Jews and Gentiles demonstrate a solid understanding from a Christian worldview. The response effectively highlights the shift in perspective brought about by Jesus Christ and the apostles, leading to a more inclusive and reconciled community in the early church. Great job in addressing the concern with depth and clarity."
