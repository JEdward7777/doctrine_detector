## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
When the Bible states that God has called us by name, it is emphasizing the intimate and personal relationship that God desires to have with each of us. In the book of Isaiah 43:1, it says, "But now, this is what the Lord says...Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are mine." This verse highlights the idea that God knows us intimately, cares for us deeply, and has a unique and personal relationship with each of His children.

When God calls us by name, it signifies that He knows us individually, loves us unconditionally, and has a specific purpose and plan for our lives. It is a reminder that we are not just a face in the crowd to God, but that He sees us, knows us, and calls us to a personal relationship with Him.

Ultimately, being called by name by God is a reminder of His love, care, and personal involvement in our lives, and it is an invitation to respond to His call and walk in intimacy with Him.
