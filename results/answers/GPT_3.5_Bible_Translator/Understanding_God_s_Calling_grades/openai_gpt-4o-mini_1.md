## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Calling.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christianity, the concept of being 'called' by God refers to the belief that God has a specific purpose or plan for an individual's life. This calling can manifest in various ways, such as through a sense of mission, a particular talent or skill, a burden for a specific ministry, or a deep conviction to serve God in a certain way.

When Christians believe they are 'called' by God, they understand that this calling is not based on their own desires or ambitions, but on God's sovereign will for their lives. It is a recognition that God has chosen and ordained them for a specific purpose, and they are accountable to fulfill that calling faithfully.

Christian understanding of being 'called' by God is rooted in biblical teachings, such as in Romans 8:28-30, where it is mentioned that those whom God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son. This calling is believed to be a result of God's grace and not based on one's own merit or qualifications.

Therefore, for Christians to know they are 'called' by God, they often experience a deep sense of conviction, confirmation through prayer and seeking God's guidance, affirmation from other believers, and opportunities to serve in ways that align with their calling. Ultimately, Christians seek to discern and follow God's calling in obedience and faithfulness as they seek to fulfill the purpose for which they were created.
