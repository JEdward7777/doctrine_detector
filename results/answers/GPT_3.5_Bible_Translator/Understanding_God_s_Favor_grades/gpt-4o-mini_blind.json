  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a solid answer supported by Luke 2:52, demonstrating how Jesus grew in favor with both God and men through wisdom, righteousness, love, compassion, and humility. The response correctly emphasizes Jesus' obedience to God, prayer life, and ministry of preaching the Gospel and showing compassion. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on the concept of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection as central to how he ultimately secured favor with both God and humanity."
