In the Bible, Luke 2:52 says, "And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man." This verse demonstrates that Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and men by growing in wisdom, living a righteous life in obedience to God, and by showing love, compassion, and humility towards others. Jesus consistently showed favor with God through his perfect obedience, prayer life, and intimate relationship with the Father. He also showed favor with men by preaching the Good News, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and showing compassion and mercy to those in need. Ultimately, Jesus' life and ministry exemplified the perfect balance of both God's favor and the admiration and respect of those around him.

Comment: The student provided a solid answer supported by Luke 2:52, demonstrating how Jesus grew in favor with both God and men through wisdom, righteousness, love, compassion, and humility. The response correctly emphasizes Jesus' obedience to God, prayer life, and ministry of preaching the Gospel and showing compassion. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on the concept of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection as central to how he ultimately secured favor with both God and humanity.
