  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComments: This response provides a thorough and well-articulated comparison between the concept of God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory. The student effectively highlights the intrinsic nature of God's glory as opposed to the temporary and deceptive nature of worldly glory. The inclusion of Scriptural warnings and the Christian call to seek and reflect God's glory adds depth to the answer. Overall, a strong explanation with doctrinal correctness. Great job!"
