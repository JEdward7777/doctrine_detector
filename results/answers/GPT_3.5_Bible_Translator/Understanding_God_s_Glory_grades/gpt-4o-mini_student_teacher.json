  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the differences between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory. They correctly emphasized the eternal and perfect nature of God's glory compared to the temporary and fleeting nature of worldly glory. The student effectively linked the concept of God's glory to proper worship and the Christian worldview. However, the student's answer could have been enhanced by directly referencing the immeasurable superiority of God's glory in comparison to earthly glory, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. This alignment would have further strengthened the student's response from a Christian-specific perspective."
