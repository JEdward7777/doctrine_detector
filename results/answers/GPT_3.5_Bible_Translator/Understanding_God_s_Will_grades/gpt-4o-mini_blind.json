  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 95. \n\nThe answer provides a clear and concise explanation of seeking God's will in everyday decisions: it emphasizes submitting to God, seeking biblical guidance, prayer, scripture study, wise counsel, and sensitivity to the Holy Spirit. The response accurately conveys the importance of aligning one's choices with God's revealed truth and recognizing His sovereignty over our lives. The only potential improvement would be to include a mention of seeking God's will through the lens of glorifying Him in our decisions. Overall, an excellent answer."
