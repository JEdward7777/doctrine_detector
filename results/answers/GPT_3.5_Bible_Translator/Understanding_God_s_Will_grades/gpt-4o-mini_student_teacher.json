  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a strong answer that aligns well with the Christian perspective on seeking God's will in everyday decisions. They correctly emphasized the importance of aligning choices with God's revealed truth in the Bible, prayer, seeking wise counsel, and listening to the Holy Spirit. The student's response effectively addresses the concern by promoting the idea of submitting personal desires to God's guidance. The slight deviation from the reference answer is the reason for the deduction in points. Overall, a well-thought-out and insightful response."
