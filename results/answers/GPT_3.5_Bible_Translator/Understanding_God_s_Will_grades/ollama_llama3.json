It also mentions the role of Scripture in guiding our decisions, which is a crucial aspect of seeking God's will.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, I would like to see more specificity on how to practically seek God's will in everyday decisions. The response could benefit from additional details on what it means to submit one's own desires and plans to God's guidance, as well as concrete examples of how this looks in daily life.\n\nThat being said, the response does a great job addressing the concern about people struggling with making decisions that honor God or feeling uncertain about His direction for their lives. It provides a clear call to action, encouraging individuals to seek God's will through prayer, study, and wise counsel."
