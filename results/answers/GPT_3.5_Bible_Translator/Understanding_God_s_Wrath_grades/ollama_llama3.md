## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Wrath.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that God's wrath is a just and righteous response to sin and rebellion against Him. Unlike human anger, which can be irrational, unjust, and driven by selfish motives, God's wrath is perfect and always in line with His holy nature.

God's wrath is not out of control, but rather a necessary and appropriate response to sin. Romans 1:18 says, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth." God's wrath is a reflection of His holiness and justice, and it is always tempered by His love and mercy.

In contrast to human anger, which can lead to resentment, bitterness, and revenge, God's wrath is a means of bringing about justice and ultimately redemption. It is a manifestation of His love for His creation and His desire for righteousness to be restored.

Ultimately, God's wrath points us to the need for a Savior, as we are all deserving of His wrath due to our sinfulness. Through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross, we can be saved from God's wrath and reconciled to Him. God's wrath serves to highlight the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance and faith in Christ.
