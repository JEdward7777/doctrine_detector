  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by clarifying that God's wrath is not a fit of rage but a measured response to sin. It accurately portrays God's wrath as a righteous judgment of sin, contrasting it with human anger. The explanation is rooted in a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of justice, holiness, and the need for a Savior. The only minor improvement could be providing a more explicit connection between God's wrath and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ."
