In Christian theology, the term "grace" refers to the unmerited favor and love that God shows towards humanity. It is often described as God's empowering presence in our lives, helping us to overcome sin and live according to His will. Grace is central to the Christian faith as it is through God's grace that we are saved from our sins and reconciled to Him.
