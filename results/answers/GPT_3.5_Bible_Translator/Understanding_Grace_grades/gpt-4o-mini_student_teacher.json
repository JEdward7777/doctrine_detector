  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a well-rounded explanation of grace in a Christian context, they do miss the mark slightly on the specific concern of clarifying God's unmerited favor. The student emphasizes grace as God's empowering presence, assistance in overcoming sin, and the gift of salvation, which is all true, but they could strengthen their answer by explicitly stating that grace is unearned and undeserved favor from God. By focusing more on the fact that grace is given freely and not based on human merit, the student could align more closely with the concern provided."
