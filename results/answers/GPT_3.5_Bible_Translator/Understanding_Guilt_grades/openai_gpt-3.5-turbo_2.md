## [Answer](../Understanding_Guilt.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Bible, guilt is the state of having committed a wrongdoing or sin against God's standards. In the Christian faith, all human beings are considered guilty before God as a result of their sinful nature inherited from Adam and their own choices to go against God's commands (Romans 3:23). The Bible teaches that the penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23), and that apart from the saving grace of Jesus Christ, all people are under the judgment of God for their guilt. However, through faith in Jesus Christ and his sacrifice on the cross, believers can receive forgiveness of their sins and be declared not guilty before God (Romans 3:24-26). This justification is a gift of God's grace and is received through faith, not by our own works (Ephesians 2:8-9).
