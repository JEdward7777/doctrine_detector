  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer accurately distinguishes between \"heaven\" and \"sky\" in Biblical terms, noting the spiritual significance of heaven as God's dwelling place and the physical aspect of the sky as the expanse above the earth. The explanation provided aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern raised in the question. The grade could be higher if the student had included a more concise definition and reference to the celestial bodies within the term \"heavens\" as mentioned in the reference answer."
