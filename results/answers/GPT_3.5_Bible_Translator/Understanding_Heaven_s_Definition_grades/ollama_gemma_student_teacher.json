  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical definitions of both \"heaven\" and \"sky,\" differentiating between the spiritual realm and the physical creation. The explanation is concise and well-articulated, referencing relevant biblical contexts. However, the student could benefit from providing additional support from scripture to strengthen their claims."
