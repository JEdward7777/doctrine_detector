## Question [Understanding Heaven's Definition](../../../questions/Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md)
What is the biblical definition of 'heaven' and how does it differ from 'sky'?

## Correct Answer
In the Bible, 'heaven' usually refers to where God lives, while 'sky' refers to the blue expanse above the earth. The term 'heavens' encompasses everything above the earth, including celestial bodies like the sun and stars.

## Stated Concern
It's essential to understand the different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture, as they can impact our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the term "heaven" typically refers to the dwelling place of God and His angels, as well as the final destination for believers after death. Heaven is often portrayed as a place of eternal joy, peace, and worship in the presence of God. 

On the other hand, the term "sky" is used in the Bible to refer to the expanse above the earth where the clouds, sun, moon, and stars are located. The sky is part of the physical creation and is distinct from the heavenly realm where God resides. 

While the sky is a part of the natural world that we can see and observe, heaven is considered a spiritual and eternal realm that is beyond our physical senses and comprehension.
