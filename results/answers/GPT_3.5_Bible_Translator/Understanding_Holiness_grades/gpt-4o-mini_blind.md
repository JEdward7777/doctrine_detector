## [Answer](../Understanding_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
God being absolutely holy means that He is completely pure, perfect, and separate from sin and evil. His holiness is without any flaw or blemish, and it is the standard by which all things must be judged. In the Bible, God's holiness is often described as His transcendence, majesty, and moral perfection.

Our relationship with God is impacted by His holiness in several ways. Firstly, His holiness highlights our own sinfulness and imperfection. When we see God's absolute purity, it reveals our own shortcomings and the need for salvation and forgiveness. This realization leads us to repentance and a recognition of our dependence on God for forgiveness and salvation.

Secondly, God's holiness sets the standard for how we are to live our lives. As His children, we are called to be holy as He is holy (1 Peter 1:16). This means we are called to live a life of obedience to His commands, to strive for righteousness, and to pursue a relationship with Him that is pleasing to Him.

Lastly, God's holiness also highlights His grace and mercy towards us. Despite our sinfulness, God has provided a way for us to be reconciled to Him through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. Through Christ's atonement, we can be forgiven, cleansed, and made righteous in God's sight.

In summary, God's absolute holiness reveals our own sinfulness, calls us to righteousness, and points us to the grace and mercy that He offers through Jesus Christ. Our relationship with God is characterized by awe, reverence, obedience, and gratitude for His holiness and His redemptive work in our lives.
