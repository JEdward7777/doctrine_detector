  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of God's absolute holiness and its implications on our relationship with Him. However, there is a slight deviation from the specified concern as the answer focuses more on God's holiness and the broader theological implications rather than reflecting deeply on our own holiness and the steps needed to approach a holy God. The student effectively communicates the significance of God's holiness in revealing our sinfulness, calling us to righteousness, and pointing to God's grace and mercy through Christ."
