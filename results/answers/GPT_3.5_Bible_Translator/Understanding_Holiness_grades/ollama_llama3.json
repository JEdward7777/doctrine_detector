  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of highlighting the significance of God's absolute holiness, its impact on our relationship with Him, and the importance of His transcendence, majesty, and moral perfection. The writer effectively uses biblical references to support their claims and provides a clear and concise explanation of how God's holiness relates to our own sinfulness, righteousness, and redemption.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern about approaching a holy God. While the writer does touch on this theme when discussing repentance and dependence on God for forgiveness, they could have more directly explored the need for spiritual preparation or the role of Jesus' sacrifice in enabling us to approach God. Additionally, some sentences could be tightened up for greater clarity.\n\nOverall, though, this is a strong response that effectively engages with the concept of God's absolute holiness and its implications for our relationship with Him."
