  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that aligns well with the Christian perspective on humility before God. They effectively discussed the concepts of recognizing sinfulness, surrendering one's will to God, seeking repentance, and trusting in God's sovereignty. The answer could be improved by focusing more on the simplicity and directness of submitting to God's will and acknowledging His greatness, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a good understanding of humility in relation to one's relationship with God in a Christian worldview."
