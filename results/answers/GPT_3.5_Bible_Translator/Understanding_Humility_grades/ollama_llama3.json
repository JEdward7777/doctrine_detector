  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does touch on some key aspects of humility before God, such as submitting one's will to God and recognizing His greatness. It also acknowledges one's own weaknesses and imperfections, which is an important aspect of Christian humility. However, the response could be strengthened by further developing these ideas and providing more specific examples or biblical support.\n\nOne area where the response could improve is in its lack of depth and nuance on the nature of humility before God. While it mentions surrendering one's will to God, it does not adequately convey the depth and richness of this concept. Additionally, while it acknowledges one's own weaknesses and imperfections, it does not explore how this awareness should lead to a greater dependence on God.\n\nOverall, the response shows a good foundation in understanding humility before God, but could benefit from further development and exploration of these ideas."
