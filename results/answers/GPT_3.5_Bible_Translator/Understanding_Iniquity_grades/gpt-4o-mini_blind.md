## [Answer](../Understanding_Iniquity.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, there are distinctions between the terms iniquity, sin, and transgression that help to convey different aspects of wrongdoing before God:

1. Sin: Sin is a broad term used to describe any defiance of God's will, whether in thought, word, or deed. In the original Greek and Hebrew, sin means "missing the mark" or falling short of God's standard of holiness (Romans 3:23). Sin encompasses various actions that go against God's commands and can include iniquity and transgression.

2. Iniquity: Iniquity typically refers to a more deliberate and willful act of sin, often showing a lack of moral integrity or a desire to do wrong. In the Hebrew Bible, the term for iniquity is "avon," which conveys a sense of guilt, punishment, and perversity. Iniquity is often associated with a pattern of sinful behavior or a deep-seated sinfulness within an individual.

3. Transgression: Transgression specifically refers to the violation of a specific command or law. The word "transgression" in Hebrew is "pesha," which carries the idea of rebellion or willful disobedience. Transgression highlights a direct defiance of God's laws and can involve crossing boundaries set by God.

While these terms have distinct nuances, they all ultimately point to the reality of human sinfulness and the need for repentance, forgiveness, and redemption through Jesus Christ. Regardless of the specific term used, the Bible teaches that all have sinned and fall short of God's glory (Romans 3:23) and that the only remedy for sin is found in the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:24).
