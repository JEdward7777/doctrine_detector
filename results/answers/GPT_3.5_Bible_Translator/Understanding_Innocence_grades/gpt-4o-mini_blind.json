  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively describes the biblical perspective on innocence in the context of wrongful accusations, citing the examples of Joseph and Jesus to support the explanation. The student effectively connects the concept of innocence to righteousness, integrity, and justice as emphasized in biblical teachings. The response could have been strengthened by delving deeper into the theological implications of wrongful accusations and innocence in Christian theology, but overall provides a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
