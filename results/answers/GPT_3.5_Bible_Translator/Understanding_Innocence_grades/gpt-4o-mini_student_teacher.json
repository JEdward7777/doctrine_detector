  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical perspective on innocence in the context of wrongful accusation. The inclusion of examples from the story of Joseph in the Old Testament and Jesus in the New Testament effectively illustrates the concept. The answer aligns well with the given reference answer, but it could have been slightly improved by maintaining a tighter focus on the specific biblical definition of innocence. Overall, a strong response with clear connections to Christian teachings."
