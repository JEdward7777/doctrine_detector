  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession, referencing relevant Bible verses such as Romans 8:26-27 and Ephesians 6:18. The student effectively conveys the concept that the Holy Spirit assists believers in their prayers, especially when they are unable to articulate their needs. Good use of scriptural support and a clear interpretation of the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession."
