  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession, referencing relevant biblical passages to support their points. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly stating that the Holy Spirit prays to God on behalf of believers, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a strong understanding of the Holy Spirit's involvement in prayer and intercession is demonstrated."
