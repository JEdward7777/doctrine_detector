It addresses the concern by highlighting lamentation as a way for believers to process their emotions and draw closer to God during difficult times. The only improvement could be to specifically address how some Christians may struggle with expressing sorrows and regrets in a faith context, offering guidance or insights on how to overcome such struggles within a Christian worldview."
