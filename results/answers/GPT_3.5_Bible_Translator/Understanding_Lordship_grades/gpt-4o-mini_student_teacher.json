  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of the term \"Lord\" in relation to both God and Jesus, highlighting their authority, power, and sovereignty. However, the student's answer could be improved by emphasizing the ownership and divine nature aspect of the term \"Lord\" in relation to Jesus, as indicated in the reference answer. Encouraging more focus on the deity of Jesus in association with the title \"Lord\" would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
