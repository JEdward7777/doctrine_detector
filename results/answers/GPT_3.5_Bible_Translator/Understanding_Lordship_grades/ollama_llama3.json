  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student provides some accurate information about the term \"Lord\" in the Bible, noting its connection to authority, power, and sovereignty, as well as its use as a title of reverence for God. They also correctly state that when used with Jesus' name, it communicates His divinity. The inclusion of Philippians 2:9-11 is a strong point, as it provides scriptural support for the student's claims.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by further exploration and development of the concern. While the student acknowledges the importance of understanding the term \"Lord\" in relation to Jesus and God, they do not fully engage with this concept throughout their response. A deeper analysis of how the term \"Lord\" reflects God's authority and divinity would enhance the student's argument.\n\nAdditionally, some minor errors or limitations in the student's response could be addressed through further clarification or elaboration. For example, the student could provide more context about the use of \"Yahweh\" in the Old Testament or elaborate on the implications of Jesus being declared \"Lord\" by God. Nevertheless, the student demonstrates a good grasp of the concept and provides some thoughtful insights, earning an overall grade of 85."
