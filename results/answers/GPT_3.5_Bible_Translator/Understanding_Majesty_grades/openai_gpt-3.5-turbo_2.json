It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting God's unmatched excellence and holiness as well as His sovereignty over creation. The discussion of Psalm 96:6 further supports the understanding of God's attributes and His supreme authority. Overall, this is a well-rounded reflection from a Christian worldview."
