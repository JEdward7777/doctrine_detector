  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a good overview of how to demonstrate mercy in daily life, drawing parallels to God's merciful nature. The answer includes key elements such as forgiveness, compassion, offering help, being slow to anger, and extending grace. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the student could have incorporated more references to Biblical examples or teachings on mercy to strengthen the connection to a Christian worldview. Furthermore, emphasizing the importance of repentance and seeking God's guidance in showing mercy could have added depth to the response."
