The student effectively references relevant biblical passages and articulates the transformative nature of this spiritual rebirth. The emphasis on a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and the reliance on faith for this regeneration align well with Christian doctrine. It would have been even stronger if the student had expanded on the role of the Holy Spirit in the process of being born again."
