  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of being \"born again\" according to the Bible, referencing key verses such as John 3:3 and 2 Corinthians 5:17. The response accurately conveys the concept of spiritual rebirth through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the student could have included more emphasis on the aspect of moving from spiritual deadness to spiritual life as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
