## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Being "born again" is a term used in the Bible to describe a spiritual rebirth or regeneration that takes place in an individual when they accept Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord. This concept is found in the Gospel of John, chapter 3, where Jesus tells Nicodemus, a Pharisee, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3).

To be born again is to experience a transformation from a life dominated by sin and separation from God to a new life characterized by a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. This spiritual rebirth is not something that can be achieved through human effort or works, but it is a gift from God that comes through faith in Jesus Christ.

The apostle Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come." This new birth results in a changed heart, a new way of thinking, and a desire to live a life that is pleasing to God.

In summary, to be born again according to the Bible is to experience a spiritual rebirth through faith in Jesus Christ, resulting in a new life and a restored relationship with God.
