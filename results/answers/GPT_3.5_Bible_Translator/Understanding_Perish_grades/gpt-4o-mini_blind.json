It accurately conveys the consequences of rejecting God and living in disobedience, citing relevant biblical passages like John 3:16 and 2 Thessalonians 1:9. The student effectively contrasts spiritual perishing with the offer of salvation through Jesus Christ. The only improvement could be to elaborate further on the concept of eternal separation from God and delve deeper into the theological implications of spiritual perishing."
