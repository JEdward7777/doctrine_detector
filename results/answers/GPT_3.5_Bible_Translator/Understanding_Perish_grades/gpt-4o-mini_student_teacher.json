  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported explanation of what it means to \"perish\" in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. They correctly referenced key passages like John 3:16 and 2 Thessalonians 1:9 to illustrate the concept of spiritual separation from God. However, the student's answer was slightly more detailed than the reference answer provided by the teacher, which is why they are not receiving a full score."
