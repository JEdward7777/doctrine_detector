## [Answer](../Understanding_Perish.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the term "perish" is often used to refer to the spiritual consequence of rejecting God or living in disobedience to Him. It signifies a state of eternal separation from God and the blessings of salvation. 

For example, in John 3:16, it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Here, perishing is contrasted with having eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. 

In 2 Thessalonians 1:9, it speaks of those who "will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might." This describes the fate of those who reject God and perish in a spiritual sense.

Ultimately, perishing spiritually means facing the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, which results in eternal separation from Him and His love. Christians believe that Jesus offers salvation and eternal life to those who believe in Him, providing a way to escape spiritual perishing.
