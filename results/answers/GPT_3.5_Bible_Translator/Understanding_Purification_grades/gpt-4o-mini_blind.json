The student effectively explains the purpose of purification rituals and ties them back to the need for spiritual purity before God. The connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate means of purification is well articulated. One suggestion for improvement could be to provide more specific examples of purification rituals in the Old Testament to further enhance the explanation."
