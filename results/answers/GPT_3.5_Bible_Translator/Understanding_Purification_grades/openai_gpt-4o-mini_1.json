It connects these practices to the need for spiritual cleansing and forgiveness of sins, highlighting the importance of holiness, obedience, and atonement for sin in maintaining a right relationship with God. The only minor improvement could be further elaboration on how the process of ritual purification reflects God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin."
