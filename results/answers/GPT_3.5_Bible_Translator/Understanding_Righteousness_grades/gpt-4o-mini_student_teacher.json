  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response that demonstrates a good understanding of God's righteousness from a biblical perspective. The answer covers various aspects of God's righteousness, such as moral perfection, justice, and love, as well as how it relates to human sin and salvation through Jesus Christ. However, the student's answer could have been improved by emphasizing more on the condemnation of sin as a necessary aspect of God's righteousness, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, it is a strong answer that reflects a solid understanding of the topic."
