## [Answer](../Understanding_Righteousness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
To describe God as righteous means that He is morally perfect, just, and fair in all His ways. God's righteousness is a reflection of His holy nature and His utter consistency with what is good and right. In the Bible, we see numerous verses declaring God's righteousness, such as Psalm 119:137, which states, "You are righteous, Lord, and your laws are right."

God's righteousness is contrasted with human sin and unrighteousness. As a righteous judge, God cannot tolerate sin and must judge it accordingly. However, because of His great love for us, God provided a way for sin to be atoned for through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ. Through Jesus' death and resurrection, those who believe in Him are declared righteous in God's sight and are able to have a restored relationship with Him.

Ultimately, God's righteousness is a foundational aspect of His character that provides hope and assurance for believers, knowing that His justice will prevail and that He can be trusted to always do what is right.
