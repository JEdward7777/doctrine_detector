  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student's response provides a detailed explanation of why Jesus is referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. They accurately point out that Jesus's sacrificial death fulfills the ultimate sacrifice needed for the forgiveness of sins, drawing parallels between the sacrificial system in the Old Testament and Jesus being the perfect, sinless Lamb who willingly laid down His life. The student also references John 1:29 to further support their explanation.\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of Jesus as the 'Lamb of God' in fulfilling God's plan for redemption, aligning well with the Christian worldview. However, to align more closely with the reference answer, the student could have emphasized the perfection and unblemished nature of Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb even more explicitly."
