The explanation of how Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross mirrors the Old Testament sacrificial system and the symbolism of the innocent lamb as a sin offering is clear and aligns well with Christian beliefs. The reference to John 1:29 further strengthens the understanding of Jesus' role as the ultimate atoning sacrifice. Great job in connecting Jesus' sacrificial role to the broader concept of redemption in Christian theology."
