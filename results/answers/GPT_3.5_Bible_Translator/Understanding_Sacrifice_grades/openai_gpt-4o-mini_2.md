## [Answer](../Understanding_Sacrifice.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
Jesus is referred to as the 'Lamb of God' because His sacrificial death on the cross fulfills the ultimate sacrifice required by God for the forgiveness of sins, as established in the Old Testament sacrificial system. In the Old Testament, lambs were commonly used as sin offerings to atone for the sins of the people. They were innocent animals that were sacrificed in place of the guilty sinner, symbolizing the transfer of sin and guilt onto the animal.

Jesus, as the Son of God and the perfect, sinless Lamb, willingly laid down His life on the cross as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity. His death fulfilled and replaced the need for the repeated sacrifices of animals, as He became the one true sacrifice that provides eternal forgiveness and redemption for all who believe in Him.

In John 1:29, John the Baptist refers to Jesus as the Lamb of God, highlighting His sacrificial role in taking away the sin of the world. This title emphasizes Jesus' role as the ultimate atoning sacrifice, whose blood cleanses us from sin and reconciles us to God.
