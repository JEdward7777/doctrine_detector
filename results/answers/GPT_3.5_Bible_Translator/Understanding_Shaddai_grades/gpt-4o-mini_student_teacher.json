However, there was a lack of focus on the specific nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture, as the reference answer mentioned the possible connection of 'Shaddai' to 'mountain' or 'mountain range.' Encouraging the student to deepen their analysis by exploring the deeper symbolism and significance of the term 'Shaddai' in relation to God's omnipotence and other attributes revealed in Scripture would enhance the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
