  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response provided demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' strategies for resisting temptation, as seen in Matthew's Gospel. The student has correctly identified three key ways Jesus responded to Satan's temptations: relying on God's Word, staying focused on God's will, and using the power of prayer.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting these strategies to practical applications for daily life as a follower of Christ. While the student mentions that Jesus' strategies \"demonstrated how we can overcome temptations,\" this connection is not fully developed or explored in detail.\n\nOverall, the grade reflects the student's solid understanding of biblical content and their attempt to draw broader implications. However, to achieve a higher score, the response would need to more explicitly address the concern about combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ."
