It effectively addresses the concern by illustrating practical strategies for followers of Christ to combat temptation in daily life. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning Jesus' unwavering faith in God in the response, but overall, the explanation is well-rounded and well-supported with biblical references."
