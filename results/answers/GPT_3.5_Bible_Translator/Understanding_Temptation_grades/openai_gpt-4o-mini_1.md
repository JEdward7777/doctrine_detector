In the Gospel of Matthew, the Bible tells us that Jesus was tempted by Satan in the wilderness. In response to each temptation, Jesus used specific strategies to resist and overcome them:

1. Jesus relied on the Word of God: In each of the three temptations, Jesus quoted Scripture from the Old Testament to refute Satan's temptations. He quoted Deuteronomy 8:3, Deuteronomy 6:16, and Deuteronomy 6:13, showing that he relied on the authority and power of God's Word to resist temptation.

2. Jesus stayed focused on God's will: Throughout the temptations, Jesus remained steadfast in his commitment to obeying God's will above all else. He emphasized that worshiping and serving God alone was the highest priority, and he refused to compromise his devotion to God for any worldly gain.

3. Jesus used the power of prayer: Before and after his temptations, Jesus engaged in prayer to seek strength and guidance from God. Prayer was a vital tool that Jesus used to draw closer to God and equip himself to face the challenges presented by Satan.

Overall, Jesus' strategies for resisting temptation involved a combination of reliance on God's Word, staying focused on God's will, and utilizing the power of prayer. By following these strategies, Jesus demonstrated how we can overcome temptations and stay faithful to God in the face of adversity.
