  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response effectively explains the connection between trespass and sin in a Christian worldview by referencing both the Old and New Testaments. They accurately highlight the importance of seeking reconciliation and making amends for both interpersonal violations and sins against God. However, the student could strengthen their answer by emphasizing that in Christian ethics, all sins are considered trespasses against God, as stated in the reference answer."
