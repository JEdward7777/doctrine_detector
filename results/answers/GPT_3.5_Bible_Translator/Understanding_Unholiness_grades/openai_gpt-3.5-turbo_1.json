  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of what constitutes an \"unholy\" life from a Christian perspective, expanding on various behaviors and attitudes that go against God's teachings. The response shows a strong understanding of how unholiness can manifest in individual and societal contexts, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the idea of rebellion against God with the specific behaviors and attitudes mentioned in the response."
