## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of biblical warnings and judgments, the term "woe" is used to signify deep distress, anguish, or impending judgment. It is a pronouncement of sorrow or distress upon individuals, groups, or nations who have acted in ways contrary to God's will. In the Bible, the term "woe" is often used by the prophets to denounce sin, call for repentance, and warn of the consequences of disobedience to God's commands.

For example, in the book of Isaiah, the prophet pronounces "woe" upon those who engage in injustice, oppression, and idolatry (Isaiah 5:8-23). Jesus also uses the term "woe" in his teachings to warn against hypocrisy, greed, and pride (Matthew 23:13-36). In these instances, "woe" serves as a powerful declaration of judgment and a call to turn back to God in repentance.
