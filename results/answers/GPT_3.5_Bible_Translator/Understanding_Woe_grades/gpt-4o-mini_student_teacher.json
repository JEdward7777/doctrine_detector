  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments, demonstrating a clear understanding of the implications related to sin and judgment. The student effectively references examples from both the Old Testament (Isaiah) and the New Testament (Matthew) to support their explanation. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the concept of suffering as punishment for sins, mentioned in the reference answer, to the student's response for a more precise alignment with the concern."
