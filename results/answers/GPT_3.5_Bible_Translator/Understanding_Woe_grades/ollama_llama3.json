  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately conveys that \"woe\" signifies deep distress or impending judgment, which aligns with the biblical warnings related to sin and judgment (concern). The example from Isaiah and Matthew also demonstrates an understanding of how \"woe\" is used in Scripture. However, the response could be improved by providing more depth and analysis on the implications of these warnings.\n\nThe given answer (\"The term 'woe' signifies a feeling of great distress and serves as a warning that people will experience suffering as punishment for their sins.\") is partially correct but lacks the nuance and biblical context provided in the original response. The concern requires an understanding of the broader biblical themes, and while this response touches on some of these ideas, it could be developed further.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the basic concept, but there is room for improvement in terms of depth and analysis to fully address the concern."
