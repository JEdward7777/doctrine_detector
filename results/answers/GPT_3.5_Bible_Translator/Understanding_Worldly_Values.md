## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian teachings, the term "worldly" typically refers to behaviors and values that are focused on materialism, selfishness, and sinfulness, rather than on following God's will and living according to His principles. Worldly attitudes often prioritize wealth, power, pleasure, and transient things over spiritual values, selflessness, and obedience to God.

The Bible warns against being conformed to the patterns of this world (Romans 12:2) and cautions against loving the world or the things in the world, as they are not from the Father but from the world (1 John 2:15-17). Instead, Christians are encouraged to set their minds on things above, not on earthly things (Colossians 3:2), and to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness (Matthew 6:33).

Ultimately, being "worldly" in the Christian sense implies a focus on temporary, fleeting pleasures and values that are contrary to God's truth and will, rather than prioritizing eternal values and living a life that reflects the love and grace of God.
