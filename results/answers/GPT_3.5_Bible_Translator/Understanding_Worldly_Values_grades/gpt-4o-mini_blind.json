  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of what the term \"worldly\" implies according to Christian teachings. It accurately describes how worldly behaviors and values go against God's will and principles, citing relevant biblical passages to support the explanation. The only room for improvement would be to perhaps delve deeper into how Christians can actively combat worldly influences in their lives, but overall, this is a strong and doctrinally sound response."
