  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of what the term \"worldly\" implies according to Christian teachings, highlighting the focus on materialism, selfishness, and sinfulness over following God's will. The student also referenced relevant Bible verses to support their explanation. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of contrasting worldly values with godly principles as explicitly stated in the prompt. Additionally, the teacher's reference answer emphasized the evil values and behaviors associated with being \"worldly\" more directly, which the student's answer did not fully capture."
