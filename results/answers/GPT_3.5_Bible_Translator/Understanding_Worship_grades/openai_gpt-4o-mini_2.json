  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the definition of worship by emphasizing various forms of expression, such as prayer, singing, and communal worship. It also highlights the importance of worship in connecting believers with God. The only minor critique is that it could have explicitly tied the acts of honoring, praising, and obeying God mentioned in the given answer to the broader understanding of worship explained in the response."
