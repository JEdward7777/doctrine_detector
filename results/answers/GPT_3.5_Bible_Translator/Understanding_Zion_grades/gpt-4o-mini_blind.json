  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel from a biblical perspective. The student effectively connects the term to themes of restoration, redemption, and hope, and also accurately portrays the Messianic hope associated with it. The response could be slightly enhanced by further elaborating on the specific historical and cultural context of the term in relation to Israel's relationship with God, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
