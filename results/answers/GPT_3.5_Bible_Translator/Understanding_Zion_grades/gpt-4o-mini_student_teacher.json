  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written and comprehensive answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel. The student effectively discusses the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people. The answer references relevant biblical passages and themes, showing a deep engagement with the topic. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further connect the language used to the broader theological implications for God's covenant relationship with His people."
