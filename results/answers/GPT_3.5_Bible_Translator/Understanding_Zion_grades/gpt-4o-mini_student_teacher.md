The term "Daughter of Zion" is used in the Bible as a poetic and symbolic way to refer to the people of Israel, particularly Jerusalem. The term carries with it themes of restoration, redemption, and hope for the people of Israel. In the Old Testament, it often appears in prophecies and poetic literature, emphasizing God's promise to restore and redeem his people.
