## Question [Understanding of Sheol and Hades](../../questions/Understanding_of_Sheol_and_Hades.md)
How do the concepts of Sheol and Hades differ in the context of the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous?

## Target answer from notes
In biblical context, Sheol and Hades refer to a place of the dead but were understood differently over time. Initially, both represented a neutral place where all the dead awaited judgment. However, in the New Testament, Hades becomes associated primarily with the unrighteous, contrasting with 'Abraham's side' or 'paradise' for the righteous.

## Concern to grade by
Understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death.

## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, Sheol and Hades are both terms used to refer to the realm of the dead, but they are often used in slightly different ways.

In the Old Testament, Sheol is the Hebrew term used to describe the place of the dead, both righteous and unrighteous. It is portrayed as a shadowy underworld where all the dead reside, without making a distinction between the righteous and the unrighteous. It is often depicted as a place of darkness and silence, where there is no activity or consciousness.

In the New Testament, the term Hades is used in a similar way to Sheol, as a place where the dead reside, but there is a bit more distinction made between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous. In Luke 16:19-31, Jesus tells the story of the rich man and Lazarus, where the rich man is in torment in Hades while Lazarus is comforted in Abraham's bosom. This suggests that in the New Testament understanding, Hades is divided into compartments for the righteous and the unrighteous.

Ultimately, both Sheol and Hades are temporary holding places for the dead, and the final destinations for the righteous and the unrighteous are described in terms of heaven and hell. For Christians, the hope is in the resurrection of the dead and the promise of eternal life in the presence of God for those who have faith in Jesus Christ.
