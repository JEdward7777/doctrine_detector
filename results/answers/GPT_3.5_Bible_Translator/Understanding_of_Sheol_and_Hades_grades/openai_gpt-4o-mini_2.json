  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and detailed explanation of the understanding of Sheol and Hades in the Bible, particularly focusing on the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death. The mention of the story of the rich man and Lazarus from Luke 16:19-31 effectively highlights this distinction in the New Testament. The response successfully addresses the concern raised, demonstrating a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on the afterlife. Overall, a thorough and well-supported explanation."
