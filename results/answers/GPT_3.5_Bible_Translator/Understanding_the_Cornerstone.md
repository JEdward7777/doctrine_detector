## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, Jesus Christ is often referred to as the "cornerstone" in the context of the assembly of believers, which is the church. This imagery is based on a biblical metaphor found in Ephesians 2:20, where Jesus is described as the cornerstone upon which the entire structure of the church is built.

As the cornerstone, Jesus holds a central and foundational role in the assembly of believers in several ways:

1. Foundation of faith: Just as a physical building relies on a cornerstone for stability and structure, the church depends on Jesus as the foundation of our faith. He is the unchanging and solid rock on which we build our beliefs and our lives.

2. Uniting force: The cornerstone also serves as a unifying element that brings together believers from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. In Christ, we are all one body, bonded together by our common faith in Him.

3. Source of identity: Jesus as the cornerstone defines the identity of the church. Our beliefs, values, and purpose as a community of believers are all rooted in Him. He sets the tone for how we are to live, love, and serve one another.

4. Capstone of redemption: In addition to being the foundation, Jesus is also the capstone or finishing touch of God's redemptive plan. Through His death and resurrection, He completed the work of salvation, providing forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God for all who believe in Him.

Overall, the metaphor of Jesus as the cornerstone emphasizes His central and essential role in the assembly of believers, highlighting His significance, authority, and power in shaping and sustaining the church.
