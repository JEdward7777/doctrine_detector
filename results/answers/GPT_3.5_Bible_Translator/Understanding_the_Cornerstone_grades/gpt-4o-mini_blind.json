  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and thorough explanation of the role of Jesus Christ as the \"cornerstone\" in the context of the assembly of believers. The student effectively outlines the foundational, unifying, identity-defining, and redemptive aspects of Jesus in relation to the church. The answer is doctrinally sound, well-supported by relevant Biblical references, and demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian theology. Great job!"
