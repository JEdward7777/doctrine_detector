The response does acknowledge Jesus' foundational support for the Assembly, which is a crucial aspect of the metaphor. However, it does not explicitly discuss the unifying force, source of identity, or capstone of redemption that are also implicit in the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone.\n\nTo improve, the response could provide more specific examples of how Jesus as the cornerstone impacts a believer's faith and community involvement, such as explaining how His role sets the tone for how we live, love, and serve one another. Additionally, the response could explore the biblical basis for this metaphor in greater detail, such as citing additional verses from Ephesians or other relevant passages."
