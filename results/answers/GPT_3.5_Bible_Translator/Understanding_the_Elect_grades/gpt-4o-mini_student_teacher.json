  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of being \"elect\" or \"chosen\" in Christian theology, referencing relevant Bible verses and emphasizing God's sovereignty and grace in salvation. The answer effectively conveys the significance of being chosen by God in one's faith journey. However, the reference answer from the teacher more succinctly captures the essence of being part of the 'elect' as being appointed or selected by God for holiness and bearing spiritual fruit. The student's response could have been improved by aligning more closely with the concise definition provided in the reference answer."
