  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70.\n\nWhile the student did a good job explaining the term \"house of God\" in both the Old and New Testament contexts, their answer goes beyond the specific concern provided. Their additional explanation about individual believers being temples of the Holy Spirit and the Church as the \"house of God\" is not directly related to the significance and meaning of the term in Scripture, which was the specific focus of the concern.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the term \"house of God\" in a biblical context, but their answer could have been more focused on the specific concern provided."
