  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical concept of the \"house of God.\" It provides a comprehensive overview of its physical and spiritual significance in both the Old and New Testaments. The student accurately highlights the connection between the physical temple and the idea that individual believers are temples of the Holy Spirit. Additionally, the student's explanation of the Church as the \"house of God\" is insightful and demonstrates an understanding of the communal nature of faith. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of the \"house of God\" in biblical contexts beyond just physical structures."
