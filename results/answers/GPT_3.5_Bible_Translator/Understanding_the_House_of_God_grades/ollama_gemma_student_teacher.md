In biblical context, the term "house of God" generally refers to a place dedicated to worshiping and seeking God. It can refer to the physical temple in Jerusalem in the Old Testament, where God's presence was believed to dwell among the Israelites. 

In the New Testament, the concept of the "house of God" expands to include the idea that individual believers themselves are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). Additionally, the Church is often referred to as the "house of God" or the "temple of God" as it is a community of believers united in Christ and indwelt by the Holy Spirit.

Overall, the term "house of God" emphasizes the sacred and holy nature of a place where God is worshiped and where believers are called to gather in fellowship and to grow in their relationship with Him.
