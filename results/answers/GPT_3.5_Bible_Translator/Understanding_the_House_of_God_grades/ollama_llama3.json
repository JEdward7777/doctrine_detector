  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately defines the term \"house of God\" in biblical context, mentioning both the physical temple in Jerusalem and the concept of believers as temples of the Holy Spirit. It also provides a good overview of the significance of the term, emphasizing its connection to worship and fellowship with God.\n\nThe main area for improvement is that the response could benefit from more specific examples or Scriptural support to further clarify the meaning of \"house of God\". Additionally, while it mentions the concept of believers as temples of the Holy Spirit, it could delve deeper into this idea and explore its implications for Christian living.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the biblical concept of the \"house of God\", but could be more comprehensive in its exploration."
