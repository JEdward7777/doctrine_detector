It effectively clarified the meaning of the term and its broader implications beyond just the physical structures of the tabernacle or temple. The integration of relevant biblical references and the explanation of believers as temples of the Holy Spirit added depth to the response. Overall, this response aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern provided."
