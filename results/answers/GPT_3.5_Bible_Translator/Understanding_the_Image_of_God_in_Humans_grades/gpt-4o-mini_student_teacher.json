  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the characteristics that reflect the image of God according to the biblical definition. They accurately list and elaborate on various qualities such as rationality, emotions, creativity, morality, spirituality, and stewardship. The response aligns well with the reference answer from a Christian worldview, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. However, there is some verbosity in the answer, which could be trimmed to enhance clarity and conciseness."
