  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-explained answer that captures the essence of the concept of the \"last days\" in Christian theology. They correctly highlight the importance of understanding the timeline between Jesus' first and second comings and tie it to Biblical events and Christian faith. The student also emphasizes the role of anticipation, vigilance, spreading the gospel, and being prepared for Christ's return in the \"last days.\" While their answer aligns closely with the reference answer, the student's response includes additional details and explanations, which show a strong grasp of the topic. Great job overall!"
