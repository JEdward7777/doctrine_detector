## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Last_Days.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of the "last days" in Christian theology refers to the period of time between Jesus' first coming, when He incarnated, died on the cross, and rose again, and His second coming, which is yet to occur. This period is characterized by a sense of anticipation and expectation of Christ's return, as well as a time when certain events prophesied in the Bible will come to pass.

The "last days" signify the time when Jesus' redemptive work on the cross has been accomplished, but the full realization of His kingdom on earth is yet to be fully established. It is a time when there will be wars and rumors of wars, natural disasters, persecution of Christians, and moral decay (Matthew 24:6-14).

As Christians, we are called to be vigilant and faithful during these "last days," continuing to spread the message of the gospel and living lives of holiness and obedience to God. We are also encouraged to look forward to the blessed hope of Christ's return, when He will establish His kingdom in its fullness and bring about the restoration of all things (Acts 3:21).

Therefore, the "last days" serve as a reminder of the reality of Christ's first coming and the promise of His second coming, urging us to live in anticipation of His glorious return and to be prepared for that day.
