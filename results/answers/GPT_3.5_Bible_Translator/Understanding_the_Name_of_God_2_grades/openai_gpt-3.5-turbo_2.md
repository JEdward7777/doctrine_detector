## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Name_of_God_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The name "Yahweh" is the personal name of God in the Old Testament. It is a sacred and significant name that signifies the self-existent and eternal nature of God. In Hebrew, "Yahweh" is often translated as "I am who I am" or "I am that I am." This name emphasizes God's unchanging and eternal character, as well as His sovereignty, holiness, and faithfulness. The Israelites considered the name "Yahweh" too sacred to speak aloud and would often refer to God simply as "the LORD" (in all capital letters) when reading or quoting Scripture.
