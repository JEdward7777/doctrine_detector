The name "Yahweh" in the Old Testament is significant because it is the personal name of God as revealed to Moses at the burning bush in Exodus 3:14-15. The name "Yahweh" conveys the idea of God's eternal and unchanging nature, emphasizing His self-existence and faithfulness. In the Jewish tradition, the name "Yahweh" is considered so holy that it is often replaced with the word "Adonai" (Lord) when reading aloud. The significance of the name "Yahweh" underscores the intimate and personal relationship that God desires to have with His people.
