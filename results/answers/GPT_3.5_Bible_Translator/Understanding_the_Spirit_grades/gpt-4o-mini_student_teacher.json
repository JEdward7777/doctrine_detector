  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-articulated and thoughtful explanation of the distinction between the human spirit and evil spirits based on a Christian worldview. They have correctly identified the characteristics and origins of each type of spirit as presented in the Bible. The student's response aligns closely with the reference answer, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, they could have included more specific biblical references to support their points and strengthen their argument further."
