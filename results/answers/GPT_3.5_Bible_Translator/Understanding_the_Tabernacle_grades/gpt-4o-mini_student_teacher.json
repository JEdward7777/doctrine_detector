They have accurately highlighted key purposes such as God's presence, sacrifice and atonement, worship, and communication of spiritual truths. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the core aspect of the tabernacle as a place of worship and following God's instructions for its construction, as emphasized in the reference answer."
