  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a well-articulated and insightful explanation of the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus' identity. The student effectively ties in Old Testament prophecy, Jesus' dual nature as fully God and fully human, and the establishment of God's kingdom on earth. The only minor improvement would be to perhaps delve a bit deeper into the humanity aspect of the title \"Son of Man\" by exploring Jesus' understanding of suffering and servanthood in connection to this title."
