  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" by referencing the Old Testament prophecy in Daniel and highlighting Jesus' dual nature as fully God and fully human. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern of the implications of Jesus being the \"Son of Man\" for our faith, as well as connecting it more directly to His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity as per the reference answer provided by the teacher."
