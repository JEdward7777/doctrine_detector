## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Title.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "Son of Man" has significant theological implications in the context of Jesus' identity. In the Gospels, Jesus often referred to himself as the "Son of Man," and this title can be traced back to the Old Testament book of Daniel.

In Daniel 7:13-14, the prophet Daniel has a vision of the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven, and he is given dominion, glory, and a kingdom that will never be destroyed. This figure represents a divine being who will rule in the end times. Jesus' use of the title "Son of Man" points to his identity as the fulfillment of this prophecy, as the one who has come to establish God's kingdom on earth.

Furthermore, the title "Son of Man" emphasizes Jesus' humanity. While Jesus is fully God, he is also fully human, and by referring to himself as the "Son of Man," he highlights his solidarity with humanity and his role as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.

In summary, the title "Son of Man" signifies Jesus' identity as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, the establishment of God's kingdom on earth, and his dual nature as fully God and fully human.
