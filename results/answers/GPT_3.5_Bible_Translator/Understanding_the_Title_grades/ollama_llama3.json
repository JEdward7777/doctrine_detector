The writer correctly identifies Jesus' use of the title as pointing to his fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, his role in establishing God's kingdom on earth, and his dual nature as fully human and fully divine.\n\nThe response also highlights Jesus' humanity through his use of the \"Son of Man\" title, emphasizing his solidarity with humanity and his role as mediator between God and humanity. The writer's inclusion of Daniel 7:13-14 provides a clear biblical foundation for their understanding of the title's significance.\n\nHowever, the response does not fully address all the implications of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man.\" While it mentions Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy and his role as mediator, it does not explicitly discuss how this identity relates to our faith or our relationship with God. The writer's summary statement also seems a bit general, lacking specific biblical support for their claims.\n\nOverall, while the response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the \"Son of Man\" title, it could be strengthened by further development and explicit application to our faith."
