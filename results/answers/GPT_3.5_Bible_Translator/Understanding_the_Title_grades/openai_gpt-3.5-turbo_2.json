It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the theological implications of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" and how it relates to our faith. The connection to Old Testament prophecy and the establishment of God's kingdom is well articulated, showcasing a solid understanding of Christian theology. Great job overall!"
