  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the consequences that God pronounces on ungodly people according to the Bible. The student correctly highlights the themes of separation from God, judgment and punishment, and destruction for those who persist in unrepentant sin. The inclusion of relevant biblical references strengthens the answer. However, to improve the grade, the response could delve deeper into the biblical descriptions of Hell and the severity of eternal separation from God for a more comprehensive understanding of the consequences. Additionally, connecting these consequences to the theological concept of God's justice and mercy would enhance the overall analysis."
