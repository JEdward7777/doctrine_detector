  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response, citing relevant biblical references to support their points. They correctly emphasized the consequences of separation from God, judgment, and destruction for ungodly people. However, the student could improve their answer by explicitly addressing the aspect of God's wrath and judgment as the reference answer indicated. Overall, a strong effort demonstrating understanding of the spiritual ramifications of disobeying God from a Christian worldview."
