## [Answer](../Ungodliness_Consequences.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
The consequences that God pronounces on ungodly people vary throughout the Bible, but some common themes include:

1. Separation from God: Unrepentant sinners face the ultimate consequence of eternal separation from God's presence (Isaiah 59:2, Romans 6:23).

2. Judgment and Punishment: Those who reject God and His ways will face His judgment and punishment, including the possibility of suffering in Hell (Matthew 25:46, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9).

3. Destruction: Some passages speak of the destruction of the wicked and their works, emphasizing the finality and seriousness of godlessness (Psalm 1:6, 2 Peter 3:7).

It is important to note that while these consequences are pronounced in the Bible, God's desire is always for repentance and reconciliation rather than judgment (2 Peter 3:9). He offers forgiveness and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ to all who turn from their sins and believe in Him (John 3:16, Acts 3:19).
