  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of how the term \"Holy One\" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to refer to God and Jesus. They effectively articulated the divine nature and sinlessness associated with this title. However, they could have further emphasized the direct connection of the term to Jesus as the 'Holy One' in the New Testament to more explicitly explore His authority and divinity."
