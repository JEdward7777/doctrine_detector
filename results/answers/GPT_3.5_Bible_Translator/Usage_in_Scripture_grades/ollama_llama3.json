  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student's response does provide some accurate information about the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments, mentioning its usage to refer to God as well as Jesus Christ. They also correctly point out that the phrase \"Holy One of Israel\" is used in the Old Testament, while in the New Testament, it specifically refers to Jesus.\n\nHowever, the response could have delved deeper into exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which was the specified concern. While the student does mention Jesus' sinlessness and purity, they do not go beyond that to explore His divine nature or authority as seen in the New Testament.\n\nThe comment on the grade would be: \"While this response provides some accurate information about the term 'Holy One,' it could have gone further in exploring the significance of this title in relation to Jesus' divinity and authority. The student does provide some relevant examples from Scripture, but could have dug deeper into the theological implications.\""
