The term "Holy One" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to refer to God Himself as the Holy One of Israel, emphasizing His absolute holiness and set-apartness from sin and impurity. This term also appears in reference to Jesus Christ, as the Holy One of God, highlighting His divine nature and sinlessness.

In the Old Testament, "Holy One" is used numerous times to refer to God as the Holy One of Israel, such as in Psalm 71:22, where it says, "I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel." This term underscores God's divine nature and moral purity.

In the New Testament, the term "Holy One" is used to refer to Jesus Christ, as seen in Luke 4:34 where a demon acknowledges Jesus as the "Holy One of God." This title affirms the sinlessness and purity of Jesus, as the one who came to save humanity from sin.

Overall, the term "Holy One" highlights the absolute holiness of God in both the Old and New Testaments and underscores the importance of living in obedience to His righteous standards.
