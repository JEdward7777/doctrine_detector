  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately addresses the concern by highlighting the cultural significance of myrrh in biblical burial practices, demonstrating an understanding of its importance in the context of scripture. The writer provides specific examples from the Bible, including Matthew and John, to support their claim that myrrh was used as a preservative and symbol of reverence for the deceased.\n\nThe response also partially addresses the concern by noting the aromatic and preservative qualities of myrrh, which helps to establish its significance in biblical times. However, it could be further developed by exploring the cultural context surrounding burial practices and their implications for understanding scripture.\n\nOverall, this response is strong and demonstrates a good grasp of the customs surrounding burial practices in biblical times. With some additional development, it has the potential to be even more comprehensive and insightful."
