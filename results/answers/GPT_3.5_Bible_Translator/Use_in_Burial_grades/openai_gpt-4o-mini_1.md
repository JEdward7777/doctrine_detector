Myrrh was often used in the burial practices of biblical times as a form of embalming or as a burial perfume. In the Bible, myrrh is mentioned as one of the gifts brought by the wise men to Jesus at his birth (Matthew 2:11). Myrrh was known for its aromatic and preservative qualities, making it a common ingredient in the embalming process to help preserve the body and mask the odor of decay. 

In addition, myrrh was also used as a perfume to anoint the body of the deceased before burial, a practice that symbolized honor and respect for the departed. In the Gospel of John, myrrh is mentioned as one of the spices used by Nicodemus in preparing Jesus' body for burial (John 19:39-40). 

Overall, myrrh played a significant role in the burial practices of biblical times, both as a preservative and as a symbol of reverence for the deceased.
