The inclusion of specific Bible references adds credibility to the answer. However, it could have been improved by explicitly mentioning that the title \"Rabbi\" was used for Jesus by his disciples in some instances, such as John 1:38. Additionally, integrating a clearer emphasis on the unique authority and divinity of Jesus compared to traditional Jewish teachers might enhance the theological depth of the response."
