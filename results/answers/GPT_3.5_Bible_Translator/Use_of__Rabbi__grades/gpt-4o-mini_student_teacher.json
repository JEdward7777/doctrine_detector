  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of how John the Baptist and Jesus were not commonly referred to as \"Rabbi\" in the Gospels, but they missed the key point that both were indeed called 'Rabbi' by their disciples at times, indicating their roles as teachers. The response also accurately highlights John's role as a prophet and forerunner of Jesus, as well as Jesus being commonly referred to as \"Teacher\" or \"Master.\" However, the crucial aspect of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings, particularly through the use of the title 'Rabbi,' was not emphasized enough in the student's answer."
