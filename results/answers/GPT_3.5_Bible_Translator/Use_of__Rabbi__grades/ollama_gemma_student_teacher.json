  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the textual evidence regarding the use of the title \"Rabbi\" for John the Baptist and Jesus. It provides a clear explanation that the title was not commonly used for them in the Gospels but was occasionally used by their disciples. Additionally, the student acknowledges the respect and authority associated with their teachings. However, the answer could benefit from more explicit elaboration on the significance of the title \"Rabbi\" within the cultural and religious context of the time."
