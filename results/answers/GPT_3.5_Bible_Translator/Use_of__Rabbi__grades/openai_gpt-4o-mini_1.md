## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
John the Baptist and Jesus were not commonly referred to as "Rabbi" in the Gospels. The title "Rabbi" was often used for Jewish teachers and scholars during the time of Jesus, but the term is not specifically applied to either John or Jesus in the Bible. 

However, John the Baptist was regarded as a prophet (Matthew 21:26) and a forerunner of Jesus (Matthew 11:10). Jesus, on the other hand, was often called "Teacher" or "Master" by his disciples and followers. The title "Rabbi" was used for Jesus in a few instances, such as in John 1:38 when two of John the Baptist's disciples called Jesus "Rabbi," which means "Teacher."

Overall, while the title "Rabbi" was not commonly used for John the Baptist and Jesus in the Gospels, both were revered as important figures in Christianity for their roles in preparing the way for the ministry of Jesus.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response correctly addresses the concern by acknowledging the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. However, there is a minor discrepancy in stating that John and Jesus were "not commonly referred to as 'Rabbi'" when the Bible does show instances of them being called "Rabbi." This slightly detracts from the accuracy of the response.
