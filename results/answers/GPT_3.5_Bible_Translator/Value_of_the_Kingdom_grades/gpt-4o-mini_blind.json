  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a solid answer by correctly identifying three parables used by Jesus to describe the value of the kingdom of God. The explanation for each parable was clear and demonstrated an understanding of their significance. One suggestion for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the Parable of the Mustard Seed (Matthew 13:31-32), which also conveys the growth and expansion of the kingdom of God. Overall, a well-done response."
