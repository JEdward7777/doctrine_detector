  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided accurate parables used by Jesus to describe the value of the kingdom of God, they missed mentioning the parables of the mustard seed and yeast. These parables are crucial in understanding the transformative power and growth of the kingdom of God, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer. The student did well in highlighting the value and significance of the kingdom of God in the lives of believers, but they could have strengthened their answer by including all the parables mentioned in the teacher's reference answer for a more comprehensive understanding of the topic."
