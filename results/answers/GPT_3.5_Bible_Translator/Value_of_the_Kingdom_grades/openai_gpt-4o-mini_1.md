Jesus used several parables to describe the value of the kingdom of God. Some of these parables include:

The person who finds the treasure is willing to sell everything he has in order to obtain it, highlighting the priceless value of the kingdom of heaven.

2. The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price (Matthew 13:45-46) - Similar to the Parable of the Hidden Treasure, in this parable, Jesus compares the kingdom of heaven to a merchant in search of fine pearls who finds one of great value. The merchant is willing to sell everything he has to acquire the pearl, emphasizing the incomparable worth of the kingdom of God.

3. The Parable of the Lost Sheep (Luke 15:4-7) - While not explicitly about the value of the kingdom of God, this parable illustrates God's deep love and care for each individual, emphasizing the great value He places on every soul.

These parables serve to illustrate the immeasurable worth and importance of the kingdom of God, encouraging believers to prioritize seeking and living for God's kingdom above all else.
