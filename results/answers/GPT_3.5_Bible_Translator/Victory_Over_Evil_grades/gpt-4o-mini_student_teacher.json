  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70.\n\nThe student accurately references Revelation 20:10, which does speak of Satan's ultimate defeat and punishment. However, they did not mention the specific promise regarding the defeat of Satan through Eve's descendant (referring to the Messiah) as stated in the teacher's reference answer. By omitting this crucial aspect, the student's answer falls short of fully capturing the depth and significance of God's promise in defeating Satan. Therefore, while their response demonstrates an understanding of God's eventual triumph over evil, it lacks the specific connection to the promise regarding the defeat of Satan through the Messiah."
