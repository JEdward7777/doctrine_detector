**Grade: 80/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the biblical promise in Revelation 20:10 regarding Satan's ultimate defeat and references the context of God's victory over evil. However, it would benefit from further elaboration on the broader Christian understanding of the Messiah's role in this victory, as per the provided concern. Including a reference to the prophecy of the Messiah crushing Satan's power would strengthen the response.
