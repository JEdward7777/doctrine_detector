Comment: The response accurately affirms the promise made in Genesis 3:15 about the Messiah defeating Satan. It aligns with the concern by emphasizing the hope and assurance Christians derive from God's sovereignty and ultimate victory over evil. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a direct reference to Revelation 20:10 to provide a more holistic view of Satan's ultimate defeat in Scripture.
