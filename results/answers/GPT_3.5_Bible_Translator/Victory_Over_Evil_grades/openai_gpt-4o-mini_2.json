It accurately reflects the Christian belief in the ultimate triumph of God over evil through the Messiah. This aligns well with the concern regarding offering hope and assurance to Christians about God's sovereignty and victory. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie this promise to the ultimate defeat and punishment of Satan as described in Revelation 20:10."
