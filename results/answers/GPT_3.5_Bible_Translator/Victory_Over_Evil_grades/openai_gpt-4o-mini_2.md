What promise does God give regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan?

## Correct Answer
God promised that one of Eveâ€™s descendants, referring to the Messiah, would defeat Satan completely and crush his power forever.

In the Bible, God promises in Revelation 20:10 that Satan will ultimately be defeated and thrown into the lake of fire along with the beast and the false prophet. This is part of God's ultimate victory over evil and the establishment of His kingdom of righteousness and justice.

Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of the promise in Genesis 3:15 regarding the defeat of Satan by the Messiah. It accurately reflects the Christian belief in the ultimate triumph of God over evil through the Messiah. This aligns well with the concern regarding offering hope and assurance to Christians about God's sovereignty and victory. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie this promise to the ultimate defeat and punishment of Satan as described in Revelation 20:10.
