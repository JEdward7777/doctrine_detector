  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer beautifully explains the significance of Jesus' death on the cross in relation to Satan's dominion, providing a thorough explanation rooted in Christian theology and supported by Biblical references. The response effectively conveys how Jesus' victory over sin and death through His sacrificial death and resurrection ultimately defeats Satan's dominion. The student's understanding of the implications of Christ's victory for believers and their spiritual life is evident throughout the answer. Great job in connecting the theological concepts to practical implications for believers."
