The inclusion of Colossians 2:15 to support this perspective is commendable. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how Christ's victory impacts believers' spiritual lives, offering hope, salvation, and freedom from Satan's dominion. It aligns well with a Christian worldview and provides a strong theological understanding of the topic."
