Jesus' death on the cross holds profound significance in relation to Satan's dominion. In Christian theology, the death of Jesus on the cross is often referred to as the atonement, where Jesus, as the perfect and sinless sacrifice, paid the penalty for humanity's sin.

In Colossians 2:15, it is written that through His death and resurrection, Jesus disarmed the powers and principalities, making a public spectacle of them on the cross. This verse emphasizes how Jesus defeated the forces of evil, including Satan, through His sacrificial death and victorious resurrection.

By willingly submitting Himself to death on the cross, Jesus defeated the power of sin and death, offering salvation and reconciliation to all who believe in Him. This victory over sin and death ultimately breaks the hold of Satan's dominion over humanity, offering freedom and redemption to all who accept Jesus as their Savior.

Therefore, Jesus' death on the cross can be seen as the ultimate triumph over Satan's dominion, providing believers with the hope of life eternal and victory over the powers of darkness.
