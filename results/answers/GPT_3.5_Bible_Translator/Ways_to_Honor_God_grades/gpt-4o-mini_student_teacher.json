  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of practical ways Christians can honor God in their daily lives, covering key aspects such as prayer, Bible study, worship, service, obedience, and gratitude. However, the answer could have been more concise and direct in aligning with the reference answer from the teacher, which emphasized thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and living in a manner that showcases His greatness. Some points in the student's answer could have been more explicitly linked to these core aspects, leading to a slightly lower grade."
