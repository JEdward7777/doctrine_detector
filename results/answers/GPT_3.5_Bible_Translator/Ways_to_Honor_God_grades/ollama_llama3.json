The list of practices presented is thorough and actionable, making it easy for readers to understand what it means to live out their faith. While the response does not specifically mention \"showcasing His greatness\" as mentioned in the given answer, it does highlight the importance of glorifying God through one's actions.\n\nThe concern about exploring actionable expressions of faith and worship is well-addressed by providing a list of concrete practices that Christians can incorporate into their daily lives. The response does an excellent job of emphasizing the importance of living out faith in everyday life, rather than just abstractly expressing gratitude or praise. However, to reach a higher grade, the response could have further developed these practices and provided more specific examples or applications.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern about actionable expressions of faith and worship in everyday life."
