  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and comprehensive response that clearly articulates the understanding of the term \"Word of God\" within a Christian worldview. It correctly identifies both the written Word of God (the Scriptures) and the living Word of God (Jesus Christ) as aspects of the Word of God. The response also explains the inspiration and authority of the Bible and the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation of God."
