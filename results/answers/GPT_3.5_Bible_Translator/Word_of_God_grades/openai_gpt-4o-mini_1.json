  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Word of God\" within both the written Scriptures and the person of Jesus Christ. It effectively addresses the concern by showing a clear understanding of the scope and significance of God's communication to humanity, emphasizing the dual nature of God's revelation through written and living Word. The integration of scriptural references enhances the Christian worldview perspective presented in the response."
