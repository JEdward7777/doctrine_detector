The term "Word of God" in the Bible typically refers to both the written Word of God (the Scriptures) and the living Word of God, Jesus Christ.

In terms of the written Word of God, it encompasses the Old Testament and the New Testament, which together reveal God's will, character, and purposes for humanity. The Bible is considered to be inspired by God and authoritative for guiding our beliefs and behavior.

In terms of the living Word of God, Jesus Christ is described as the Word made flesh in the Gospel of John (John 1:14). Jesus is seen as the ultimate revelation of God to humanity, showing us what God is like and how we are to live in relationship with Him.

So, in summary, the term "Word of God" encompasses both the written Word of God (the Scriptures) and the living Word of God (Jesus Christ), which together reveal God's truth and guide us in our faith and practice.
