## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I can share that in modern times, Christians may unknowingly worship idols such as material possessions, fame, success, relationships, social media, or even ideologies that prioritize personal desires above God's will. These things have the potential to become idols when they take precedence in our hearts and lives over our worship and devotion to the one true God. It is important for Christians to regularly examine their hearts and priorities to ensure that God remains at the center of their lives.
