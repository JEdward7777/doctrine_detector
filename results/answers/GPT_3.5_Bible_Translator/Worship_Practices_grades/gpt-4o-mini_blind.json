The emphasis on regularly examining one's heart and priorities to ensure God remains at the center is commendable. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the biblical definition of idolatry and the consequences of idol worship according to Christian doctrine. Overall, a solid response that could benefit from deeper theological exploration."
