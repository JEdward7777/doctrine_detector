## [Answer](../Worship_Practices.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I can share that in modern times, Christians may unknowingly worship idols such as material possessions, fame, success, relationships, social media, or even ideologies that prioritize personal desires above God's will. These things have the potential to become idols when they take precedence in our hearts and lives over our worship and devotion to the one true God. It is important for Christians to regularly examine their hearts and priorities to ensure that God remains at the center of their lives.

Comment: The answer effectively identifies modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God, such as material possessions, fame, success, relationships, social media, and personal desires. The emphasis on regularly examining one's heart and priorities to ensure God remains at the center is commendable. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the biblical definition of idolatry and the consequences of idol worship according to Christian doctrine. Overall, a solid response that could benefit from deeper theological exploration.
