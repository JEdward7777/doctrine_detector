  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the potential idols that Christians may unknowingly worship and stresses the importance of prioritizing a relationship with God above all else. The mention of material possessions, fame, success, relationships, social media, and personal desires aligns well with the concern provided. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the idea of examining one's heart and priorities back to the concept of avoiding idolatry, to strengthen the connection between the two aspects."
