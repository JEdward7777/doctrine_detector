The Christian Bible translator effectively expands on this by mentioning additional potential idols such as fame, success, relationships, social media, and ideologies. The explanation emphasizes the importance for Christians to regularly examine their hearts and priorities to ensure that their devotion to God remains central. This response aligns well with a Christian worldview and emphasizes the significance of keeping God as the ultimate priority in one's life."
