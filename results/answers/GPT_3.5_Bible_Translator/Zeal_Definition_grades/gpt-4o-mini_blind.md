## [Answer](../Zeal_Definition.md) by [GPT 3.5 Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of Christian teachings, 'zeal' refers to a passionate and fervent commitment to God and His ways. It is an enthusiastic devotion to following Christ and spreading the message of the Gospel. Zeal in Christianity is often seen as a positive trait when it is directed towards living a life that honors God, sharing the good news with others, and serving those in need.

However, it is important to note that zeal must be tempered with wisdom, humility, and love. The Bible warns against misguided or self-righteous zeal that leads to judgmental attitudes, divisiveness, or harm to others. Instead, Christians are encouraged to cultivate a zeal that is aligned with God's will, characterized by love, compassion, and a desire to bring glory to God.

One well-known example of zeal in the Bible is the apostle Paul, who demonstrated great passion and dedication in his mission to spread the Gospel, even in the face of persecution and hardships. Ultimately, zeal in the Christian context is about wholeheartedly pursuing a relationship with God and living out His purposes with enthusiasm and sincerity.
