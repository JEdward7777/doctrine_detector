  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-rounded and insightful explanation of zeal in the Christian context, highlighting the importance of passion, devotion, and service in aligning one's actions with God's will. The inclusion of cautionary notes about misguided zeal and the emphasis on love and humility demonstrate a solid understanding of the biblical context. Just a minor point of improvement would be to more directly address the reference answer provided by incorporating the specific point about actively promoting a good cause in obedience to God."
