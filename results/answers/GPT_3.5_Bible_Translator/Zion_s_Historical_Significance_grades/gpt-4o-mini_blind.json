They have effectively discussed how King David conquered and established the stronghold on Mount Zion as the political and religious center of his kingdom. Additionally, the student appropriately connected Mount Zion's significance to the presence of God, its role as a place of worship, and its importance throughout Israel's history. The incorporation of Christian theology and the symbolism of Mount Zion as the heavenly Jerusalem was well done.
