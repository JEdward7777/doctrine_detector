  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the significance of the atonement lid in the context of the Ark of the Covenant from both Old Testament and Christian theological perspectives. It correctly connects the symbolism of the mercy seat to the atonement provided by Jesus Christ. However, the grade is slightly lowered due to minor room for improvement in terms of depth of theological explanation and scriptural references."
