  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer that showcases a solid understanding of the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament. They effectively linked the significance of the atonement lid in the context of the Ark of the Covenant to Christian theology, demonstrating a clear connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate atonement. The response could be improved by emphasizing even more on the representation of God's mercy and the role of the high priest in mediating for the people."
