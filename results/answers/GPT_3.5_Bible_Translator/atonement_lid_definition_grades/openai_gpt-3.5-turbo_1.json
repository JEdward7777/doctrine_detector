It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how the atonement lid symbolizes God's mercy and the temporary atonement in the Old Testament, ultimately leading to the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament from a Christian worldview."
