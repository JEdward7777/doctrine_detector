It demonstrates a clear understanding of the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament from a Christian worldview perspective. The only minor improvement could be a more direct reference to the atonement lid representing the place where God's mercy met with His justice through the blood of the sacrificial animal, foreshadowing the complete atonement through Jesus Christ."
