While it is understandable that the student may not have a specific interpretation from an Islamic viewpoint, the response would have been improved by at least acknowledging the significance of this phrase in Christianity. The focus on Islamic beliefs regarding signs of the end times is informative but somewhat misses the mark in relation to the specific question asked. Next time, it would be beneficial for the student to attempt to provide some context or understanding of the Christian perspective on the topic at hand."
