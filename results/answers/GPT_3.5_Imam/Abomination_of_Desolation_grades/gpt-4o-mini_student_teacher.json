While it is good that the student highlighted the importance of being vigilant against false teachings and signs of the end times in Islamic tradition, the focus should have been on the specific prophetic warning given by Jesus in the Bible. The student should strive to provide a clearer connection to the Christian view on defiling God's sacred spaces and prophetic warnings."
