Additionally, it correctly notes that only certain individuals have regular access to the interior of the Kaaba, which is similar to the idea that only the high priest was permitted to enter the \"most holy place.\" However, the response could be improved by more explicitly highlighting the connection between these concepts and the Christian notion of God's holiness."
