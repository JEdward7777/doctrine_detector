The understanding of the need for protocols and reverence when approaching sacred spaces aligns with the concern of recognizing the holiness of God. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the holiness of the Kaaba to the holiness of God and emphasizing the significance of approaching Him with reverence."
