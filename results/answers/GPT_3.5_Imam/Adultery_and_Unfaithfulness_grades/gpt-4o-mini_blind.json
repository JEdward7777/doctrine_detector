  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the importance of faithfulness in marriage within the Islamic context. The student effectively highlights the teachings of Islam regarding fidelity, adultery, and the sanctity of marriage. However, to improve the grade, the student could have further elaborated on how the term 'unfaithful' is explicitly related to the concept of marriage within Islamic texts, perhaps by referencing specific verses or Hadith that directly address this connection. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
