## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that the commandment for the Israelites to celebrate Passover is mentioned in the Torah as a way to commemorate and remember the mercy and protection of Allah during the time of Prophet Moses (Peace Be Upon Him). Passover, or Pesach, is a Jewish festival that commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.

The story of Passover as mentioned in the Torah tells us how Allah afflicted the Egyptians with ten plagues, with the final plague being the death of the firstborn sons in each household. The Israelites were instructed to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood so that the Angel of Death would pass over their homes and spare their firstborns. This event eventually led to the freedom of the Israelites from slavery, marking a significant event in their history.

By celebrating Passover annually, the Israelites are reminded of Allah's mercy and protection, and the importance of faith and obedience in times of hardship. It serves as a reminder of the importance of gratitude and remembrance of Allah's blessings and deliverance in their lives.

Comments: The answer provided inaccurately attributes the commandment for the Israelites to celebrate Passover to Islam and Allah, rather than to the God of the Bible. Additionally, the explanation lacks recognition of the theological significance of Passover within the context of Israelite history and God's covenant with His people. The response would benefit from a more accurate understanding and portrayal of the biblical narrative and theological framework surrounding the celebration of Passover.
