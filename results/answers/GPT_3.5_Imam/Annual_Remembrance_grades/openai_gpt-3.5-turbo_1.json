It effectively ties the commemoration of Passover to the faith and obedience of the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of gratitude and remembrance of Allah's blessings. The response could have further connected the concept of remembrance to the Christian faith context explicitly, but overall, it demonstrates an understanding of the importance of remembrance in religious traditions."
