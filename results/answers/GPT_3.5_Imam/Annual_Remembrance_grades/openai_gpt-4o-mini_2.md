## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that the commandment for the Israelites to celebrate Passover is mentioned in the Torah as a way to commemorate and remember the mercy and protection of Allah during the time of Prophet Moses (Peace Be Upon Him). Passover, or Pesach, is a Jewish festival that commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.

The story of Passover as mentioned in the Torah tells us how Allah afflicted the Egyptians with ten plagues, with the final plague being the death of the firstborn sons in each household. The Israelites were instructed to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood so that the Angel of Death would pass over their homes and spare their firstborns. This event eventually led to the freedom of the Israelites from slavery, marking a significant event in their history.

By celebrating Passover annually, the Israelites are reminded of Allah's mercy and protection, and the importance of faith and obedience in times of hardship. It serves as a reminder of the importance of gratitude and remembrance of Allah's blessings and deliverance in their lives.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response accurately explains the significance of Passover in the Jewish faith but does not adequately address the concern about recognizing the importance of remembrance in Christian faith. While the message of God's victory and deliverance is applicable to both Christianity and Judaism, the lack of specific reference to Christian teachings or principles impacts the overall grade. To improve, the response could have connected the concept of remembrance to Christian beliefs such as the Last Supper in which Jesus instructed his disciples to remember his sacrifice.
