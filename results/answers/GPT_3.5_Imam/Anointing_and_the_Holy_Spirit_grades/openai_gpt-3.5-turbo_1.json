However, it fails to address the concern of exploring the relationship between anointing and empowerment within a Christian worldview. The response mainly focuses on the differences between Christianity and Islam regarding the Holy Spirit, without delving into the specific Christian perspective on anointing and empowerment through the Holy Spirit. More emphasis on how anointing enables believers to receive empowerment and guidance from the Holy Spirit would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
