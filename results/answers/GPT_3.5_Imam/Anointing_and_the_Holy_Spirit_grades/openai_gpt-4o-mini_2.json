It effectively contrasts this Christian understanding with the Islamic perspective on the Holy Spirit as the Angel Jibril and how Muslims seek guidance and blessings through prayer and following the Quran. The response could have further delved into the biblical basis for the relationship between anointing and empowerment through the Holy Spirit to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
