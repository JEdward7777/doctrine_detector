While the Islamic perspective is presented clearly, there is a lack of engagement with the specific concern regarding traits of antichrists in Christian theology. From a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the deception regarding the identity of Jesus as the Messiah and the denial of His divinity and humanity as core traits of antichrists. The response could have further highlighted how understanding and recognizing these traits help Christians discern and resist false teachings."
