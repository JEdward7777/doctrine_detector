The student effectively discusses the importance of spreading the message of Islam. However, the answer strays from the specific question about the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the gospel. The response could be improved by directly addressing the unique roles of the apostles chosen by Jesus in the context of Christianity."
