## [Answer](../Apostleship_Understanding.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe in the Prophet Jesus (Isa) as a messenger and prophet of God. While the concept of apostles being sent by Jesus specifically may not be found in Islamic teachings, the general idea of messengers and prophets being sent by God to spread His message is a fundamental belief in Islam.

Prophethood is a special status granted by God to certain individuals to guide and teach people about the truth, righteousness, and the way to worship God. The messengers and prophets are chosen by God and given the responsibility of conveying His message to humanity.

In the case of Jesus, Muslims believe that he was sent by God as a messenger to the Children of Israel, preaching monotheism, righteousness, and ethical conduct. Muslims believe that Jesus performed miracles with the permission of God and conveyed a message of love, compassion, and forgiveness.

While the specific terminology of "apostles" being sent by Jesus may not be used in the Islamic tradition, the general concept of messengers and prophets being chosen by God to convey His message is a shared belief. Muslims also believe in the importance of spreading the message of Islam and inviting others to the worship of the One true God, in line with the example set by the prophets and messengers before.

In Islam, the final prophet and messenger is believed to be Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who was sent as a mercy to all of humanity and whose message is considered to be universal and applicable for all times and places. Ultimately, the spreading of the message of Islam is seen as a duty for all Muslims, in accordance with the teachings of the Quran and the example of the Prophet Muhammad.
