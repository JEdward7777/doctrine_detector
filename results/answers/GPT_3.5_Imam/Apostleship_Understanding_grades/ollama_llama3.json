However, it does not explicitly connect this concept to the idea of apostles being sent by Jesus or explore how Islamic teachings on prophets and messengers might inform a Christian understanding of the role of apostleship.\n\nTo improve, the response could have more explicitly addressed the concern by highlighting any similarities or differences between Christian and Islamic views on apostleship."
