It effectively addresses the concern of the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission by highlighting the general concept of messengers and prophets being chosen by God to convey His message in Islam. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of Islamic teachings and effectively draws parallels between the role of messengers in Islam and the apostles in Christianity. Further elaboration on the theological differences between apostleship in Christianity and the concept of messengers in Islam could have strengthened the response even more."
