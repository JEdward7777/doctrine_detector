  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on messengers and prophets being sent by God to convey His message, particularly focusing on Prophet Jesus. However, the response does not directly address the concern regarding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission, which is a key aspect in Christian theology. To improve the grade, the response could have addressed how the concept of apostleship in Christianity differs from the role of messengers and prophets in Islam, emphasizing the unique authority and mission given to the apostles by Jesus in spreading the Gospel."
