However, the major concern is that the student primarily discussed Islamic perspectives and practices, rather than focusing on specific Christian beliefs and principles. The answer lacked a clear Christian worldview and did not directly tie in the concept of reconciliation as understood through Jesus and God's compassion, which was the key point of the reference answer. Additionally, incorporating more scriptural references or examples from the teachings of Jesus could have enhanced the overall Christian perspective in the response."
