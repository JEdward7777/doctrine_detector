## [Answer](../Ark_Location.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Tabernacle, the ark of the covenant was located in the innermost chamber known as the Holy of Holies (Qodesh HaQodashim). It was placed behind a curtain called the "parokhet" and was considered the most sacred and holiest object in the Tabernacle. It housed the tablets of the Ten Commandments that were given to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). Only the High Priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, and that too only on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).
