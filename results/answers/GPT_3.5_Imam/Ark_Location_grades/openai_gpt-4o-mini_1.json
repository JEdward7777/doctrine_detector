However, the response does not delve deeply into the concept of the presence of God in relation to the most holy place, missing the opportunity to discuss the sacredness and reverence associated with God's presence in the Tabernacle. A stronger connection between the ark, the most holy place, and the presence of God would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
