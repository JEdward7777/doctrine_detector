## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we also believe in Jesus (peace be upon him) as a great prophet and messenger of Allah. Belief in Jesus is an integral part of Islamic faith, and Muslims hold him in high regard.

In terms of assurance given to those who believe in Jesus, the Quran mentions the following in Surah Al-Imran, 3:52: "But when Jesus felt [persistence in] disbelief from them, he said, 'Who are my supporters for [the cause of] Allah?' The disciples said," We are supporters for Allah. We have believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]." This verse highlights the loyalty and devotion of Jesus' disciples to Allah, indicating their belief and submission to His will.

It is important to understand that in Islam, assurance and salvation come through sincere faith in Allah, following His guidance as revealed in the Quran, and striving to live a righteous and ethical life. Belief in Jesus as a prophet is part of this faith, but ultimately, it is one's overall belief and actions that determine one's standing with Allah.

Muslims believe in the concept of accountability and judgment in the Hereafter, where every individual will be responsible for their choices and deeds. The final assurance and salvation are in the hands of Allah, and it is through His mercy and forgiveness that believers hope to attain salvation.

It is essential for believers, including those who believe in Jesus, to strive for righteousness, seek forgiveness for their shortcomings, and have faith in Allah's mercy and guidance. Through sincere belief and righteous deeds, individuals can hope for Allah's favor and ultimately the reward of Paradise.
