  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer focuses on Islamic beliefs rather than addressing the specific Christian assurance given to those who believe in Jesus. The concept of salvation through faith in Jesus as central to Christianity is missing from the response. The student did not directly address the concern provided, resulting in a low grade."
