  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Christian perspective on assurance and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. They effectively referenced relevant Quranic verses and emphasized the importance of sincere faith, righteousness, and accountability in Islamic beliefs. However, the answer does not directly address the specific concern regarding reassurance for believers in Jesus within the Christian worldview."
