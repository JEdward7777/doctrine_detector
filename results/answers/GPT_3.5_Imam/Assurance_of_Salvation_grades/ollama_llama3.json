However, it does not directly address the concern of reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus, as the given answer does. While the response mentions the importance of sincere faith and righteous deeds, it does not specifically highlight the assurance of salvation that comes through faith in Jesus. The tone is more focused on Islamic beliefs and practices rather than providing a message of hope and reassurance for believers."
