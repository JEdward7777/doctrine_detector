While it does not align perfectly with the Christian belief that salvation is solely through faith in Jesus and His sacrifice, it still addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of faith and righteousness in Islam. A clearer comparison and contrast with the Christian doctrine of salvation through Jesus could enhance the response."
