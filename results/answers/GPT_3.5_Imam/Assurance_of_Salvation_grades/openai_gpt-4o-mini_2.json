While it addresses the concern raised, it does so within the framework of Islamic beliefs rather than a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, salvation is based on faith in Jesus as the Son of God and His sacrificial death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins, which is not clearly articulated in the response."
