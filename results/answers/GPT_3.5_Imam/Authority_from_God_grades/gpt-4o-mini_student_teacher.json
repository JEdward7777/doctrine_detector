  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and comprehensive explanation of divine authority from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing the significance it holds in a believer's life. While the response was insightful and detailed, it did not directly align with the specific concern provided, which focused on understanding divine authority to discern God's will and maintain obedience. Therefore, the grade reflects the discrepancy in addressing the main concern."
