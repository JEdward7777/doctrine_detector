The use of Quranic references and the mention of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) add credibility to the response.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have provided more specific examples of how recognizing divine authority helps believers discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. Additionally, the writer could have explored potential challenges or misconceptions about divine authority that Muslims may face and how they can be addressed. Overall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of divine authority in Islam and its significance in a believer's life."
