## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe in the concept of Prophethood rather than apostleship, which refers to the messengers sent by Allah to guide humankind. Prophets were chosen by Allah to deliver His message to people and were granted the ability to perform miracles as a sign of their prophethood and to help establish the truth of their message.

The authority of the prophets to perform miracles and preach boldly comes from Allah, who bestowed upon them the necessary abilities and qualities to carry out their mission effectively. The miracles performed by the prophets served as clear evidence of their divine appointment and the truth of their message, helping to convince people of the authenticity of their mission.

In the Quran, Allah mentions various miracles performed by the prophets, such as the parting of the sea by Prophet Moses, the healing of the sick by Prophet Jesus, and the splitting of the moon by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon them all), as signs of their prophethood and the truth of their message.

It is important to note that prophets were not only given the ability to perform miracles but were also blessed with a deep understanding of the message they were delivering and the wisdom to preach it boldly and effectively. Their authority ultimately stems from their obedience to Allah, their sincerity in conveying His message, and their unwavering faith in Him.

Overall, the authority of the prophets to perform miracles and preach boldly was a manifestation of their special status as chosen messengers of Allah and was essential in fulfilling their mission of calling people to the worship of One God and guiding them to the right path.
