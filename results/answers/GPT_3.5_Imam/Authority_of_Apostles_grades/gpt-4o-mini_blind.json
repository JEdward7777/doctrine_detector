The answer correctly highlights that the ability to perform miracles and preach boldly stems from Allah's empowerment of the prophets and their obedience to Him. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that apostles were specifically chosen by Jesus Christ during His ministry on earth to continue His work and spread the Gospel. Therefore, the concept of apostleship in Christianity differs from Prophethood in Islam. Additionally, while the answer appropriately mentions prophets like Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, it omits the unique role of the apostles in the Christian faith, such as their witness to the resurrection of Jesus and the establishment of the early Church. Overall, the response effectively explains the Islamic beliefs but could benefit from further clarity on the distinct Christian perspective on apostleship."
