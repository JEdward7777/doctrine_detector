However, the student did not directly address the authority of the apostles in Christianity or how it relates to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. The answer focused solely on prophets in Islam rather than apostles in Christianity. An integration of Christian beliefs regarding the apostles' authority and empowerment would have strengthened the response."
