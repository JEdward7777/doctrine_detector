While the response mentions that prophets were granted abilities and qualities by Allah to carry out their mission, it does not specifically discuss the apostles or their ministry. The response also does not engage with the provided answer or explore any connections between the concepts discussed. To improve, the response could focus more directly on the concern of exploring divine empowerment and authority for the apostles, using biblical examples and language to connect with the provided answer."
