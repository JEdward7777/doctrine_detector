  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the authority and empowerment given to prophets in Islam, emphasizing their ability to perform miracles as a sign of their divine appointment. While the response effectively discusses the concept within an Islamic framework, it does not directly address the concern regarding apostles empowered by Jesus in a Christian context. The response is well-written and informative, but it lacks a direct comparison or discussion related to the concern raised."
