It effectively connects this concept to the Islamic belief in Allah's supreme power and control. However, it could have further emphasized the importance of understanding God's authority in deepening faith and trust in His omnipotence from an Islamic perspective. Overall, a solid response with room for a bit more depth in addressing the specified concern."
