It effectively discusses Jesus' role as a prophet and messenger of God, emphasizing his universal authority over all creation. The acknowledgment of Jesus' authority as a divine king aligns well with the concern about believers acknowledging His sovereignty in their lives. The integration of Islamic beliefs with a Christian worldview could be beneficial for interfaith understanding."
