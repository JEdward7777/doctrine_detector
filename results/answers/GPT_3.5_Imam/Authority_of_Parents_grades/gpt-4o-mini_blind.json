  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of parental authority within Islam, citing relevant Quranic verses and hadiths. However, the question specifically asked for the Biblical basis for parental authority over children, and the response did not address this aspect. In a Christian grading context, the answer would need to focus on scriptural references supporting parental authority within Christianity."
