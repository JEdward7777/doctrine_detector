  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-structured and informative response from an Islamic perspective on parental authority, the question specifically asked for a Biblical basis within a Christian framework. The student's answer did not address the question directly with a Christian worldview, leading to a lower grade. It's important to stay aligned with the specific context and framework outlined in the question."
