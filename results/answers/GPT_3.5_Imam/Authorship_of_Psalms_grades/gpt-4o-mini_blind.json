However, from a Christian worldview, the question specifically inquires about key figures involved in writing the Psalms, which refers to the Judeo-Christian tradition. The answer should have focused on figures like King David and other authors of the Psalms as recognized in the Bible. It is important to provide information accurate to the context of the question being asked."
