  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provided insightful information about the Islamic perspective on the Psalms (Zabur), the response did not directly address the Christian view of the key figures involved in writing the Psalms. In a Christian worldview, King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph are recognized as key figures in writing the Psalms, which was missing in the student's answer. The understanding of authorship in the Judeo-Christian tradition provides important context for interpreting the messages and themes present in the Psalms."
