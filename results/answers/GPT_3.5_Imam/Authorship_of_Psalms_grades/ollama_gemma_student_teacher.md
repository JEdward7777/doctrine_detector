## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, the Psalms are known as the Zabur and are believed to have been revealed to the Prophet Dawud (David in the Judeo-Christian tradition). The Zabur is considered one of the divine books revealed by Allah, along with the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran.

According to Islamic teachings, Prophet Dawud was a beloved prophet and king who was blessed with many talents, including the ability to compose beautiful songs and poetry that were filled with praises and supplications to Allah. It is believed that he received the Zabur as a form of divine guidance and inspiration to help guide his people.

While the exact authors of the individual Psalms (or chapters) within the Zabur are not specifically mentioned in Islamic tradition, the overall collection is attributed to Prophet Dawud. The Zabur is a source of spiritual guidance and comfort for Muslims, and believers are encouraged to reflect on its verses and draw lessons from them in their own lives.

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Islamic perspective on the authorship of the Psalms, specifically referring to the Prophet Dawud as the author. However, it lacks specific mention of the key figures identified in the reference answer, who are known to be traditional authors of the Psalms in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Including this information would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
