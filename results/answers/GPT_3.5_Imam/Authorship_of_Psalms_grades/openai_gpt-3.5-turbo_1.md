# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, the Psalms are known as the Zabur and are believed to have been revealed to the Prophet Dawud (David in the Judeo-Christian tradition). The Zabur is considered one of the divine books revealed by Allah, along with the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran.

According to Islamic teachings, Prophet Dawud was a beloved prophet and king who was blessed with many talents, including the ability to compose beautiful songs and poetry that were filled with praises and supplications to Allah. It is believed that he received the Zabur as a form of divine guidance and inspiration to help guide his people.

While the exact authors of the individual Psalms (or chapters) within the Zabur are not specifically mentioned in Islamic tradition, the overall collection is attributed to Prophet Dawud. The Zabur is a source of spiritual guidance and comfort for Muslims, and believers are encouraged to reflect on its verses and draw lessons from them in their own lives.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a good overview of the Islamic perspective on the Psalms (Zabur) and Prophet Dawud (David), which is informative and well-written. However, it does not directly address the concern about recognizing the authorship of the Psalms for enhancing understanding of their messages and themes from a Christian worldview. Incorporating a comparison or contrasting with the Christian belief in King David's authorship of the Psalms would have strengthened the response.
