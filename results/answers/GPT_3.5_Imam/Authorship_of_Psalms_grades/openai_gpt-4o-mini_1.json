  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response regarding the authorship of the Psalms in Islam is informative, but it does not directly address the concern raised about understanding the messages and themes of the Psalms. While it provides insight into the Islamic perspective on the Zabur, it lacks a comparison or analysis of how recognizing the specific authors of the Psalms can enhance understanding. To improve the grade, the student should have connected the authorship information provided in the concern to the content of the response."
