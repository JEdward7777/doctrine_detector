However, it did not address the concern raised regarding the importance of recognizing the authorship of Psalms in understanding their messages and themes, which is an essential aspect when approaching biblical texts from a Judeo-Christian perspective. Incorporating this aspect would have improved the response and demonstrated a deeper engagement with the subject matter."
