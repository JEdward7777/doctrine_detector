However, from a Christian perspective, it is essential to uphold the biblical truth that Jesus is indeed the Son of God, not in a biological sense but in terms of His unique relationship with God the Father as part of the Holy Trinity. The answer falls short in affirming this doctrinal correctness, which is crucial when discussing the identity of Jesus in any cultural context. It is important to find ways to convey this truth effectively rather than compromising the biblical narrative."
