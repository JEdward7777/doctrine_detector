## Question [Avoid 'Son of God'](../../../questions/Avoid__Son_of_God_.md)
Should the term 'Son of God' be avoided in translations due to potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures?

Avoidance can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity.

## [Answer](../Avoid__Son_of_God_.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
Yes, it is generally recommended to avoid using the term "Son of God" in translations when trying to convey the concept of Jesus in polytheistic cultures. This is because the term can be easily misunderstood to imply a literal biological relationship between God and Jesus, which is contrary to Islamic beliefs and can be confusing in polytheistic contexts where the concept of multiple gods and divine offspring exists.

Instead, it is more appropriate to use terms that accurately convey the relationship between Jesus and God as understood in Islamic theology, such as "Messenger of God" or "Servant of God." These terms emphasize the prophetic and submissive nature of Jesus towards God, and help to avoid any confusion or misunderstandings that may arise from the term "Son of God" in certain cultural contexts.

Grade: 60

Comment: The answer acknowledges the potential for misunderstanding the term "Son of God" in polytheistic cultures and suggests using alternative terms like "Messenger of God" or "Servant of God" to avoid confusion. However, from a Christian perspective, it is essential to uphold the biblical truth that Jesus is indeed the Son of God, not in a biological sense but in terms of His unique relationship with God the Father as part of the Holy Trinity. The answer falls short in affirming this doctrinal correctness, which is crucial when discussing the identity of Jesus in any cultural context. It is important to find ways to convey this truth effectively rather than compromising the biblical narrative.
