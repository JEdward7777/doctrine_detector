  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful consideration of the potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures and suggests alternative terms to convey Jesus' relationship with God. However, the student fails to address the concern that avoidance of the term \"Son of God\" can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. The reference answer provides a stronger perspective in this context, emphasizing the importance of teaching and explaining the meaning of the term rather than avoiding it altogether."
