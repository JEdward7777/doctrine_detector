  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful consideration of the potential misunderstandings that may arise from using the term \"Son of God\" in polytheistic cultures and suggests alternative terms to convey the relationship between Jesus and God. While it appropriately addresses the concern about avoiding theological gaps and misunderstandings, it could have further emphasized the importance of teaching and explaining the term rather than completely avoiding it. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the issue at hand from a Christian worldview perspective."
