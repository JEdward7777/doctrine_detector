However, it does not sufficiently address the concern that avoidance can lead to theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity, which could potentially be detrimental to individuals encountering this concept in a polytheistic or Islamic context. Overall, while the response has merit, it could be improved by acknowledging the concern more explicitly."
