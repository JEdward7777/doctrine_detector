  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful explanation of baptism from a Christian perspective, emphasizing its symbolic significance and spiritual importance. However, the answer did not specifically address the key point that baptism signifies cleansing from sin and unity with Christ, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student's response captures the general concept of baptism well, but lacks precision in addressing the specific concern of understanding the importance of baptism in the Christian faith according to New Testament teachings."
