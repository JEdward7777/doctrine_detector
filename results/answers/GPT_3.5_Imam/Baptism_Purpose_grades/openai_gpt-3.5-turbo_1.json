It acknowledges the cleansing from sin and union with Christ that baptism signifies, demonstrating a good understanding of the importance of baptism in the Christian faith. However, as a Muslim Imam, incorporating a comparison with Islamic beliefs about purification and spiritual transformation could have added depth to the explanation."
