While the discussion on repentance in Islam was thorough and accurate, the explanation of baptism in Christianity lacked some key doctrinal aspects. A higher grade could have been achieved by emphasizing that in Christianity, baptism signifies not only initiation into the faith but also a means of spiritual regeneration and identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection as taught in the New Testament. Additionally, more clarity on the scriptural basis and theological significance of baptism in relation to repentance would have enhanced the response."
