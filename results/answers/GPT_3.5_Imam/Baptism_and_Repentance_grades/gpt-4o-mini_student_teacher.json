  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of repentance in Islam and Christianity, but failed to address the specific concern of the relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine. The reference answer highlights that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism based on instances in the New Testament where individuals repented before being baptized. The student's response did not directly address this relationship, leading to a lower grade."
