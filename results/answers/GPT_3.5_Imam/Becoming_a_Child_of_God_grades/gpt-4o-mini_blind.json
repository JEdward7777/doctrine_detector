A more complete answer would have involved explaining the Christian belief in Jesus as God the Son, the second person of the Trinity, and the concept of adoption as children of God through faith in Jesus Christ. The response could have also touched on the importance of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection in bridging the gap between humanity and God in the Christian faith."
