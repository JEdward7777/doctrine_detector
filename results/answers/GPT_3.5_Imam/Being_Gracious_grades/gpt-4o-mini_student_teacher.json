They emphasized the importance of showing kindness, generosity, and forgiveness in interactions with others, aligning with the Christian obligation to be forgiving and kind. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the Christian worldview when discussing the concept of being gracious. Additionally, focusing more on forgiveness, as emphasized in the concern, would have strengthened the response."
