However, to align more closely with a Christian worldview, the response could have included references to Christian teachings on forgiveness and kindness, such as the example of Jesus Christ forgiving those who wronged Him and teaching to love one's enemies. Integrating these Christian perspectives would have enhanced the overall analysis."
