  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings during Jesus' time. They accurately described the Pharisees' belief in the resurrection of the dead, accountability for actions, and their distinction from other Jewish groups. The student effectively addressed the concern by enhancing understanding of the spiritual landscape during that period. Great job!"
