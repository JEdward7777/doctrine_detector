  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately summarizes the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings, contrasting them with the Sadducees. It directly addresses the concern by acknowledging that exploring these beliefs can deepen understanding of the spiritual context during Jesus' time. However, providing more specific examples or details about how these beliefs influenced interactions with Jesus or His teachings could further enrich the response and elevate the grade."
