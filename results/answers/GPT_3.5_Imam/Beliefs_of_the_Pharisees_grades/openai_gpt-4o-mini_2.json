  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively summarizes the Pharisees' belief in the afterlife and spiritual beings, particularly in contrast to the Sadducees. It shows an understanding of the spiritual beliefs prevalent during Jesus' time. However, further elaboration or explanation on how these beliefs influenced the interactions between Jesus and the Pharisees could enhance the response for a higher grade."
