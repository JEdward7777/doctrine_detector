It accurately reflects the concern of recognizing the significance of these principles in the Christian faith. The only improvement would be to incorporate a direct reference to specific biblical passages that demonstrate the apostles' use of the term \"beloved\" and elaborate on how these passages emphasize love and unity in the Christian community."
