The response focused on Islamic teachings rather than engaging with the question from a Christian worldview. Additionally, since the question was asking specifically about benefits in the context of 'in Christ,' the response did not align with that framework. It would have been more effective to relate the benefits of sharing from a Christian perspective and provide scriptural references to support the points made."
