The focus should have been on understanding the practical implications of a relationship with Christ specifically. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice and experiencing His blessings were key aspects that were not addressed in the student's response. There is value in understanding and appreciating the differences in beliefs between Islam and Christianity, but the answer missed the mark in terms of directly addressing the question from a Christian perspective."
