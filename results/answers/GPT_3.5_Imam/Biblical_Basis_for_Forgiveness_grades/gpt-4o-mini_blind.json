However, as a Christian-specific worldview is being applied, the prioritization should be on providing interpretations and teachings aligned with Christian doctrine. The response includes relevant Bible verses but could have expounded more on their significance within Christian theology. Additionally, while highlighting similarities between Christianity and Islam on forgiveness is informative, a stronger focus on the unique Christian perspective would have been beneficial."
