  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses emphasizing forgiveness, which aligns with the concern given. However, there was a significant deviation in the focus of the response towards comparing Islam and Christianity on the concept of forgiveness, which was not required in the question. The student also did not include Ephesians 4:31-32, as specified in the reference answer. Overall, the student showed an understanding of the importance of forgiveness in Christianity but diverged too much into discussing Islamic beliefs instead of focusing solely on the Christian perspective."
