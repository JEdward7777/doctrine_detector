  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of forgiveness among individuals from a Christian worldview. The student provides relevant Bible verses to support their claim and also acknowledges the importance of forgiveness in Islam. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the concern of identifying scripture that supports the practice of forgiveness among believers. The student's answer also lacks some elaboration on the significance of forgiveness in Christian theology."
