The connection between forgiveness among believers and seeking forgiveness from God is well-articulated. The given response effectively addresses the concern by identifying key verses supporting the practice of forgiveness. However, there was a missed opportunity to include Ephesians 4:31-32 in the initial response, which would have further enriched the discussion on forgiveness in Christianity."
