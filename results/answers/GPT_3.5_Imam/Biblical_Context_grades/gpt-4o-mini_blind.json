  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of the responsibilities of deacons as outlined in the New Testament. The student accurately references Acts 6 and the qualifications for deacons in 1 Timothy 3. They effectively communicate the primary responsibilities of deacons in serving the community and upholding the values of the faith. However, to improve the grade, they could have delved deeper into the spiritual aspects of the role of deacons, such as their role in shepherding and spiritual leadership within the church. Additionally, incorporating more Scriptural references to support their points would have strengthened the response."
