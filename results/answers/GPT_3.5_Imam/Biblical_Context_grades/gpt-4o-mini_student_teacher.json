  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, they accurately mentioned the importance of fair treatment regarding the distribution of food among widows, aligning with the specific concern provided. The student made good use of relevant biblical references to support their points. However, the student's answer was somewhat verbose and could have been more concise in addressing the concern directly without elaborating on additional details. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the responsibilities of deacons in ensuring fair treatment within the church community based on the given concern."
