## [Answer](../Biblical_Context.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, specifically in the book of Acts chapter 6, we find the establishment of the role of deacons in the early Christian community. The primary responsibility of deacons is to serve the community by attending to the practical needs of the members, especially in matters related to charity and social welfare.

For example, in Acts 6:1-6, it is mentioned that the deacons were appointed to ensure that the distribution of food among widows was done fairly and equitably. They were responsible for serving and caring for the physical needs of the community so that the apostles could focus on preaching and teaching the word of God.

Additionally, in the letters of Paul to Timothy in the New Testament (1 Timothy 3:8-13), specific qualifications for deacons are outlined, emphasizing qualities such as being dignified, honest, and committed to the teachings of the faith. Deacons are expected to lead by example and conduct themselves in a manner that reflects the values of the Christian community.

Overall, the New Testament describes the responsibilities of deacons as serving the community, attending to the practical needs of the members, and upholding the values and teachings of the faith through their actions and conduct.
