  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response detailing examples of humility from Islamic teachings, but the question specifically asked for a biblical example. The student did not directly address the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures from a Christian worldview. It is important to stay focused on the specific requirements of the question and provide relevant examples within the context given."
