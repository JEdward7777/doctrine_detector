  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of humility within the Islamic tradition, focusing on Prophet Jesus and Prophet Muhammad as examples of humility. While the response stays within the Islamic context and does not directly address the Christian specific concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures, it effectively conveys the importance of humility in Islam through these examples. It demonstrates a strong understanding of humility in religious teachings, earning a high grade."
