While the response does not directly address the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures from a Christian worldview, it does effectively demonstrate how humility is valued and exemplified in Islam. Connecting the examples to the given answer on David as a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God would have strengthened the response and better addressed the concern."
