In the Quran, there are several biblical figures mentioned as being blameless or having high moral character, such as Prophet Noah (Nuh), Prophet Abraham (Ibrahim), Prophet Moses (Musa), Prophet Job (Ayub), and Prophet Maryam (Mary).

From the life of Prophet Noah, we can learn the importance of calling people to righteousness and patience in the face of rejection. Prophet Abraham shows us the significance of complete trust in Allah and willingness to sacrifice for His sake. Prophet Moses teaches us the importance of standing up for justice and leading with humility and wisdom. Prophet Job exemplifies patience and gratitude in times of hardship.

Comment: The response provides a good overview of biblical figures mentioned in the Quran and their characteristics that align with the concept of blamelessness and high moral character. However, the specific focus on Abraham and Noah in the provided answer could be expanded to include examples from Prophet Moses, Job, and Mary as well to fully address the concern of practical application for Christians. Additionally, tying in the importance of faith, patience, perseverance, and righteousness for Christians to emulate from these figures would strengthen the response.
