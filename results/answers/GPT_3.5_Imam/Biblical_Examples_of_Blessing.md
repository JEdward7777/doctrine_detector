As a Muslim Imam, I follow the teachings of the Quran, which offers similar concepts to the story of creation found in the Bible. In Islam, one of the main examples of God blessing creation is in Surah Al-Fatihah (The Opening), where it is mentioned that God is the most Merciful and the most Compassionate.
