The response did not address the request for a biblical example of God blessing creation. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, the Quran is not considered a source of divine revelation, so quoting from it may not be relevant to the question. The response would have been more accurate if it had focused on providing a specific example from the Bible that demonstrates God's blessing upon creation."
