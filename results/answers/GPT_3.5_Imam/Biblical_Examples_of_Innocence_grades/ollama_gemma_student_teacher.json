  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 60/100\n\n**Comment:** \nWhile the student's answer demonstrates an understanding of the concept of innocence and provides relevant examples from the Quran, it lacks specificity and coherence with the given concern. The answer should have focused on Scripture (the New Testament) as specified in the question, rather than the Quran. Additionally, the student's response does not directly address the accusations made against Jesus and their relevance to the Christian understanding of his innocence."
