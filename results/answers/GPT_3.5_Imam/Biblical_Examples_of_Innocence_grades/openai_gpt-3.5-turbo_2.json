The examples provided from the Quran showcase a different perspective on Jesus' innocence, affirming his righteousness. However, the response could have elaborated more on the theological significance of these parallels and their implications for Christian-Muslim dialogue on the shared belief in Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations."
