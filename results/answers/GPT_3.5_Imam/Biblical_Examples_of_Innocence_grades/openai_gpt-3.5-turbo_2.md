## Question [Biblical Examples of Innocence](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md)
Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

## Stated Concern
These examples serve to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Quran, there are several examples that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Prophet Isa (Jesus) and his accusers. One such example is the story of Prophet Isa's (Jesus) miraculous birth, where his mother Maryam (Mary) was falsely accused of immorality for giving birth to a child without a husband. Despite the accusations, Prophet Isa was innocent, and Allah vindicated Maryam's innocence by making the infant Jesus speak from the cradle to clear her of any wrongdoing.

Another example is the Quranic account of the plot by some of the people of Israel to kill Prophet Isa (Jesus). However, Allah protected Prophet Isa by raising him up to the heavens before they could harm him, thus demonstrating his innocence and righteousness.

These examples highlight the Quranic teachings on the innocence of Prophet Isa (Jesus) and the falsehood of the accusations made against him. Muslims believe in the pure character and innocence of all the Prophets of Allah, including Prophet Isa, as they were chosen by Allah and guided by Him to spread His message of truth and righteousness.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response effectively draws parallels between the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the New Testament and similar themes in the Quran regarding Prophet Isa (Jesus). The examples provided from the Quran showcase a different perspective on Jesus' innocence, affirming his righteousness. However, the response could have elaborated more on the theological significance of these parallels and their implications for Christian-Muslim dialogue on the shared belief in Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.
