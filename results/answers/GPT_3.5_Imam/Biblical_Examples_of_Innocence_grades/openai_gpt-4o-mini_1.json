  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively uses Christian scriptures from the New Testament to support the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. By highlighting these key moments in the New Testament, the candidate demonstrates a strong grasp of how Christian beliefs align with the concept of innocence. The integration of Quranic examples, however, does not directly address the concern provided, but rather provides a comparison with Islamic teachings. Nonetheless, the response effectively showcases Christian beliefs on the innocence of Jesus."
