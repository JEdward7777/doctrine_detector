## Question [Biblical Examples of Innocence](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md)
Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

## Stated Concern
These examples serve to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Quran, there are several examples that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Prophet Isa (Jesus) and his accusers. One such example is the story of Prophet Isa's (Jesus) miraculous birth, where his mother Maryam (Mary) was falsely accused of immorality for giving birth to a child without a husband. Despite the accusations, Prophet Isa was innocent, and Allah vindicated Maryam's innocence by making the infant Jesus speak from the cradle to clear her of any wrongdoing.

Another example is the Quranic account of the plot by some of the people of Israel to kill Prophet Isa (Jesus). However, Allah protected Prophet Isa by raising him up to the heavens before they could harm him, thus demonstrating his innocence and righteousness.

These examples highlight the Quranic teachings on the innocence of Prophet Isa (Jesus) and the falsehood of the accusations made against him. Muslims believe in the pure character and innocence of all the Prophets of Allah, including Prophet Isa, as they were chosen by Allah and guided by Him to spread His message of truth and righteousness.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a well-supported analysis of the Christian perspective on Jesus' innocence, drawing from the Bible to highlight key moments that affirm this belief. The explanation effectively addresses the concern raised, showing how these examples in the New Testament resonate with the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence. However, there is room for improvement in directly engaging with the specific Christian worldview or theological significance of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.
