  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided examples from the Quran that illustrate the concept of mercy, which is informative. However, the concern specifically asked for examples from the Bible, so the response does not directly address the task at hand. Additionally, the student did not incorporate real-life applications to enhance the understanding of mercy as requested. Overall, while the examples provided are relevant to the student's faith tradition, they do not fully align with the given concern."
