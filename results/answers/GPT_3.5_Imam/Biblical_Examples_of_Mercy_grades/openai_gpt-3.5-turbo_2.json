  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-thought-out explanation of mercy in Islam through scriptural references and examples.

The examples are clear and directly related to the concern of enhancing understanding of mercy through scriptural references and real-life applications. A higher grade could be achieved by including a deeper exploration of how these examples can be applied in practical situations today."
