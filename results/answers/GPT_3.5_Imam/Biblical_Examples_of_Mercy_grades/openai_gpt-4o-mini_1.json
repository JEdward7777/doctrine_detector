The references to Prophet Abraham, Prophet Muhammad, and Prophet Yusuf give clear scriptural support for the importance of mercy in Islamic teachings. However, it would have been beneficial to provide more depth in explaining the significance of these examples and how they can be applied in real-life situations, thereby enhancing the understanding of mercy further. Additionally, incorporating a comparison or contrast with the Christian perspective on mercy could have added a broader perspective to the discussion."
