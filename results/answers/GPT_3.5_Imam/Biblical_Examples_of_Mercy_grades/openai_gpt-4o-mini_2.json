It enhances understanding by connecting these references to real-life examples and demonstrating how mercy is practiced in the lives of prophets and believers. The examples are relevant and show the importance of showing mercy, compassion, forgiveness, and kindness towards others in Islam. Additionally, the response stays true to a Muslim Imam's perspective, focusing on Islamic teachings and beliefs regarding mercy."
