## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Mercy.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I can provide examples from the Quran that highlight the concept of mercy:

1. Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) displayed great mercy and compassion when he prayed for the people of Lot, even though they were sinners. He asked Allah to spare them from punishment.

2. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is known as the "Mercy to the Worlds" due to his compassion and mercy towards all of creation. He taught his followers to be kind, forgiving, and merciful to others.

3. The story of Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) demonstrates the concept of mercy when he forgave his brothers for betraying him and showed them kindness and love despite their past actions.

4. In Surah Al-Furqan, Allah describes the believers as those who walk on the earth with humility and when the ignorant address them, they respond with words of peace.

These examples from the Quran emphasize the importance of showing mercy, compassion, forgiveness, and kindness towards others, which are key principles in Islam.
