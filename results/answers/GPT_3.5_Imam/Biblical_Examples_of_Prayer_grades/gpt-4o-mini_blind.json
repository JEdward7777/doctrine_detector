  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the power and importance of prayer in Islam, drawing upon relevant Quranic verses and teachings of Prophet Muhammad. The examples given effectively demonstrate the significance of prayer in the Islamic faith. However, the lack of examples from the Bible, as requested in the question, slightly lowers the grade. To improve, it would be beneficial to also include examples from the Bible to directly address the question from a Christian perspective."
