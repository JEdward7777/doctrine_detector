  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough and well-explained response from an Islamic perspective, the answer did not directly address the question in the context of examples from the Bible. The student's response effectively highlighted the importance of prayer in Islam, but did not fulfill the requirement of providing biblical stories to illustrate the power and importance of prayer. It is essential to focus on the specific question asked and provide relevant examples to support the arguments presented."
