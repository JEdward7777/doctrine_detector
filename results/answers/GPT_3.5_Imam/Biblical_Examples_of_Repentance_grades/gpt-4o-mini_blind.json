The examples of Prophet David (Dawud) and Prophet Jonah (Yunus) are indeed relevant, but the response could have been strengthened by directly quoting passages from the Bible that illustrate acts of repentance. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological significance of repentance within Christianity. Overall, the response shows a respectful approach to the topic but falls short in providing specific biblical examples."
