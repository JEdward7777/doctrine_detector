  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided examples from the Bible that demonstrate repentance, they missed the opportunity to directly cite the specific references as requested in the question. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the context and significance of each biblical example to better emphasize the practical application of repentance in believers' lives. The blending of Islamic teachings, while informative, strayed from the focus on biblical examples, making the response somewhat tangential to the given question."
