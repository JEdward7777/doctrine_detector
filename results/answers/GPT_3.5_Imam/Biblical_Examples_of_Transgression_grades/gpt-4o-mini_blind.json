  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of transgression in Islam, with references from the Qur'an and Hadiths. However, the question specifically asked for Biblical references, not Islamic references. The answer would have been more appropriate if it had focused on Biblical passages and examples, aligning more closely with the question asked. The content provided is informative and well-structured, but it does not directly address the specific request about Biblical references."
