## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Transgression.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe in the concept of transgression as well. Transgression, or "israf" in Arabic, refers to exceeding the limits set by Allah or committing wrongful actions. The Qur'an and Hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) provide many references to transgression and its consequences.

One verse in the Qur'an that illustrates the concept of transgression is in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:190), where Allah says, "And do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption." This verse emphasizes the prohibition of causing corruption and transgression on the earth.

Another example is found in Surah Al-A'raf (7:56), where Allah says, "And cause not corruption upon the earth, after its reformation. And invoke Him in fear and aspiration. Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good." This verse highlights the importance of avoiding transgression and corruption after the earth has been reformed by Allah.

Furthermore, in a Hadith narrated by Abu Huraira, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body that if it becomes good (reformed), the whole body becomes good, but if it becomes corrupt, the whole body becomes corrupt. That piece of flesh is the heart." This Hadith emphasizes the importance of guarding one's heart from transgression and corruption.

In Islam, transgression is condemned and believers are encouraged to fulfill their duties and obligations without exceeding the limits set by Allah. Transgression leads to the corruption of individuals and societies, and it is important for Muslims to strive to avoid it in all aspects of their lives.
