  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: The response provided by the student, although well-written, deviates significantly from the question's specific request for examples from the Bible. While drawing parallels between Islamic teachings and the concept of trespass can be insightful, the answer fails to fulfill the criteria of referencing biblical instances. To improve, it would be beneficial for the student to focus on providing examples solely from the Bible to reflect moral and spiritual lessons related to trespass."
