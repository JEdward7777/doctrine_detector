  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the student provided a thoughtful response with examples from Islamic teachings, they did not directly address the question about biblical examples of trespass and their moral or spiritual lessons. The answer also lacked specific references to the Bible as requested in the question. Additionally, a Christian-specific worldview was not applied in the response."
