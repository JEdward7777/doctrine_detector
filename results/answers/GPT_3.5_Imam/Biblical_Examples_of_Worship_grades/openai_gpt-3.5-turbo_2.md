## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Quran, Allah provides numerous examples where worship is contrasted with idol worship. One such example is found in Surah Al-Furqan (25:60-71) where Allah describes the contrast between true worship of Him and the worship of idols. In these verses, Allah highlights the folly of worshipping idols made of wood or stone that have no power to benefit or harm humans. He contrasts this with the worship of Allah, the Creator of all things, who alone deserves worship and devotion.

Another example can be found in Surah Al-Mu'minun (23:23-24) where Allah describes the contrast between those who worship Him alone and the polytheists who worship multiple gods besides Him. Allah emphasizes that true worship is to be directed solely to Him, the One and Only God, and that associating partners with Him in worship is a grave sin.

In these examples and many others in the Quran, the contrast between true worship of Allah and idol worship is made clear, emphasizing the importance of monotheism and the rejection of idol worship in Islam.
