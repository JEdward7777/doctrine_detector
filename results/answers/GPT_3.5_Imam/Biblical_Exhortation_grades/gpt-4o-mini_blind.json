It primarily focuses on the Islamic belief of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) being foretold by Jesus, which is not in line with Christian doctrine. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. It would be beneficial for the student to focus on the specific directives given by Jesus to his apostles in Christian teachings."
