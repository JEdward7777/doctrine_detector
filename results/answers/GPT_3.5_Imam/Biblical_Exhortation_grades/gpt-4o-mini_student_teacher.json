  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not directly address the question about the directive Jesus gave to his apostles regarding the good news in the Christian tradition. While the student provides information about Jesus in the Islamic tradition, the answer does not align with the concern of recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith. The response lacks focus on Jesus' directive to spread the good news about salvation through Him, which is central to Christian evangelism."
