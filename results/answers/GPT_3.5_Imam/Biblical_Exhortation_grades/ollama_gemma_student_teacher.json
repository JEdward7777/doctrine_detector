  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a misunderstanding of the Christian perspective on Jesus' directive regarding the good news. The student references a Quranic verse that speaks of Jesus predicting the coming of Prophet Muhammad, but this does not align with the Christian belief that Jesus' apostles were tasked with spreading the good news about salvation through faith in him. The answer also fails to address the specified concern regarding evangelism in the Christian faith."
