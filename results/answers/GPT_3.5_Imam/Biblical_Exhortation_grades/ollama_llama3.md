## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Prophet Jesus (Isa) peace be upon him is considered one of the mightiest Messengers of Allah. We believe that Jesus (Isa) called people to worship Allah alone and to be righteous in their actions. One of the directives that Jesus gave to his disciples (not apostles, as the term "apostles" is specific to the Christian tradition) regarding the good news is mentioned in the Quran in Surah Al-Saff, Chapter 61, Verse 6:

"And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: 'O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah sent to you, confirming the Law (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.' But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, 'this is evident sorcery.'"

This verse indicates that Jesus foretold the coming of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and instructed his people to follow him when he comes. This is seen as a directive to his disciples to spread the message of the coming of the final Messenger, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who would bring the final guidance for all of humanity.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

This response does not directly address the concern of recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith, as it primarily focuses on the Islamic perspective on Jesus and his message. While it does mention Jesus' disciples spreading his message, it is not explicitly discussed within the context of Christian evangelism.

However, I do appreciate that the response acknowledges the prophetic significance of Jesus' words regarding the coming of a future messenger (Prophet Muhammad), which can be seen as a nod to the importance of sharing the good news with others. Additionally, the response provides some relevant biblical and Quranic references, which adds value to the discussion.

To improve this response, I would suggest incorporating more explicit references to Christian evangelism and the importance of spreading the gospel message.
