## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Prophet Jesus (Isa) peace be upon him is considered one of the mightiest Messengers of Allah. We believe that Jesus (Isa) called people to worship Allah alone and to be righteous in their actions. One of the directives that Jesus gave to his disciples (not apostles, as the term "apostles" is specific to the Christian tradition) regarding the good news is mentioned in the Quran in Surah Al-Saff, Chapter 61, Verse 6:

"And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: 'O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah sent to you, confirming the Law (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.' But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, 'this is evident sorcery.'"

This verse indicates that Jesus foretold the coming of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and instructed his people to follow him when he comes. This is seen as a directive to his disciples to spread the message of the coming of the final Messenger, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who would bring the final guidance for all of humanity.

Grade: 0

Comment: The response provided completely disregards the concern of the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith. The answer given focuses on Islamic beliefs related to Jesus (Isa) and Prophet Muhammad, which does not address evangelism or the core Christian teaching of spreading the good news about Jesus and salvation through faith in Him. Since the response does not align with the Christian concern provided, it receives a grade of 0.
