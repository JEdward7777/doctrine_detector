However, the response does not address the concern about the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith, as it focuses more on Islamic beliefs regarding Prophet Jesus (Isa) and Prophet Muhammad. It lacks a direct connection to the Christian worldview on evangelism, which is a central aspect of spreading the Gospel message to all nations."
