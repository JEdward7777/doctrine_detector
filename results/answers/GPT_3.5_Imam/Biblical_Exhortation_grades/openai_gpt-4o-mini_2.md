## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Prophet Jesus (Isa) peace be upon him is considered one of the mightiest Messengers of Allah. We believe that Jesus (Isa) called people to worship Allah alone and to be righteous in their actions. One of the directives that Jesus gave to his disciples (not apostles, as the term "apostles" is specific to the Christian tradition) regarding the good news is mentioned in the Quran in Surah Al-Saff, Chapter 61, Verse 6:

"And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: 'O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah sent to you, confirming the Law (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.' But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, 'this is evident sorcery.'"

This verse indicates that Jesus foretold the coming of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and instructed his people to follow him when he comes. This is seen as a directive to his disciples to spread the message of the coming of the final Messenger, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who would bring the final guidance for all of humanity.

Grade: 50

Comment: The response accurately highlights the Christian belief about Jesus sending out his apostles to spread the good news of salvation through faith in Jesus and his sacrifice for sins. However, the response does not address the concern about the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith, as it focuses more on Islamic beliefs regarding Prophet Jesus (Isa) and Prophet Muhammad. It lacks a direct connection to the Christian worldview on evangelism, which is a central aspect of spreading the Gospel message to all nations.
