The student effectively demonstrates how the title fulfilled the prophecies of a messianic king from the line of David who would rule over Israel. The answer is well-supported and provides a clear explanation of the significance of Jesus being referred to as the \"King of the Jews\" in light of these prophecies. Great job!"
