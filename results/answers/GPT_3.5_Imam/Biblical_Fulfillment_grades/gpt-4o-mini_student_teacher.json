  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and accurate explanation connecting the title \"King of the Jews\" to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah from David's line establishing an eternal kingdom. The student effectively highlighted the significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies. This answer demonstrates a strong understanding of biblical prophecy and its importance in Christian theology. However, the answer could have been slightly more concise and focused on the core message of the prophecies, as shown in the reference answer."
