In a Christian perspective, hope is not only about having a desire for something to happen but is deeply rooted in the promises of God and the assurance of salvation through Jesus Christ. The response accurately presented the Islamic perspective on hope, but did not compare or contrast it with Christian beliefs on hope as requested."
