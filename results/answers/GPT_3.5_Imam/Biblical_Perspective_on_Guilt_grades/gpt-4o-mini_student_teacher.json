  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student did not address the specific concern of understanding the seriousness of sin to appreciate God's grace and mercy. While the student provided insights on accountability and seeking forgiveness in Islam, the response did not connect to illustrating the consequences of guilt and sin as highlighted in the Bible. The answer lacked a Christian-specific worldview and did not engage with the question in the context of the Bible."
