  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a partial understanding of the consequences of guilt and sin as depicted in the Bible. However, they incorrectly state that the Bible is not a reliable source of information on this topic, citing their belief in Islam. The answer lacks specific references or examples from the Bible to support their claims. Additionally, the student's response does not fully address the concern of grasping the seriousness of sin and its implications for understanding God's grace and mercy."
