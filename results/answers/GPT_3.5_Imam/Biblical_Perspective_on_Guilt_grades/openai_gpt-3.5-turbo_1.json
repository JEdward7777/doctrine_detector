However, it did not directly address the concern about fully grasping the seriousness of sin to appreciate God's grace and mercy. From a Christian worldview, understanding the gravity of sin is crucial in recognizing the need for salvation and the significance of God's grace and mercy. The response could have been strengthened by acknowledging the seriousness of sin and the need for redemption through Christ."
