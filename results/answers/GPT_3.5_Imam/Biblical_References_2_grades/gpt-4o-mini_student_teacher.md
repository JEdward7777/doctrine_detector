## [Answer](../Biblical_References_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic understanding of God's majesty, we believe in the concept of Tawheed, which affirms the oneness and supremacy of Allah. However, since you are asking from a Christian perspective, I will provide you with some Bible verses that illustrate the concept of God's majesty:

1. Isaiah 6:3 - "And they were calling to one another: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.'"
This verse emphasizes the holiness and glory of God, highlighting His transcendent majesty.

2. Psalm 145:3 - "Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom."
This verse speaks to the incomprehensible greatness of God, highlighting His majesty and grandeur.

3. Job 37:22-23 - "Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty. The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress."
These verses portray God as majestic in splendor, power, and righteousness, showcasing His awe-inspiring nature.

It is important to note that while these verses highlight the majesty of God in the Christian tradition, the Islamic understanding of Allah's majesty is rooted in the concept of Tawheed, emphasizing His uniqueness, transcendence, and oneness.
