  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a good overview of the Christian interpretation of the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah in the Old Testament, citing relevant passages like Daniel 7:13-14, Psalm 110:1, and Isaiah 53. However, the explanation could be strengthened by delving deeper into the connection between these references and the title \"Son of Man\" specifically, as well as emphasizing the Messianic significance of these passages in relation to Jesus. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates an understanding of the topic and respectfully acknowledges the differences in interpretation between Christianity and Islam."
