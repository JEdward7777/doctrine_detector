  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a decent answer by referencing Daniel 7:13-14 and highlighting the association of the 'Son of Man' with the Messiah in Christian theology. However, the student could have improved by incorporating a more detailed analysis of Ezekiel's reference and additional Old Testament passages to strengthen the argument from a Christian perspective. Additionally, the student effectively acknowledged the difference in interpretation between Christian and Islamic beliefs, which shows an understanding of religious diversity. Overall, a good attempt but with room for deeper exploration and expansion."
