  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student provides a well-researched and insightful analysis of the Old Testament references that contribute to the understanding of the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah. They correctly identify several relevant passages and explain their significance in Christian theology. However, the response would benefit from a more explicit connection to the specific concern of exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\" Additionally, the student's acknowledgment of differing interpretations of these passages across religious traditions adds nuance to their analysis."
