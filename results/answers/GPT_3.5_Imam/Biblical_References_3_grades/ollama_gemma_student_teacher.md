## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the concept of the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah is not commonly interpreted in the same way as in some Christian traditions. However, in the context of Christian theology, the title "Son of Man" is often associated with Jesus as both a human and divine figure who was to come as the Messiah.

In the Old Testament, there are several references that Christians believe point to the coming of a Messiah who is often associated with the title "Son of Man":

1. Daniel 7:13-14 - In this passage, Daniel has a vision of one like a Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven and receiving dominion, glory, and a kingdom. Many Christians see this as a prophecy of Jesus as the Messianic figure.

2. Psalm 110:1 - The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." Christians see this as a reference to the Messiah who will rule at the right hand of God.

3. Isaiah 53 - While not explicitly using the title "Son of Man," this chapter is often interpreted by Christians as a prophecy of the suffering and sacrifice of the Messiah, which they believe Jesus fulfilled.

It is important to note that interpretations of these passages vary among different religious traditions, and Muslims may have different perspectives on these prophecies. In Islam, Jesus (Isa in Arabic) is considered a great prophet and messiah, but the concept of the "Son of Man" as understood in Christian theology is not part of Islamic belief.

**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** 
The student provides a well-researched and insightful analysis of the Old Testament references that contribute to the understanding of the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah. They correctly identify several relevant passages and explain their significance in Christian theology. However, the response would benefit from a more explicit connection to the specific concern of exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man." Additionally, the student's acknowledgment of differing interpretations of these passages across religious traditions adds nuance to their analysis.
