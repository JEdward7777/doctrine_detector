  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does attempt to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\". It provides some relevant biblical references, including Daniel 7:14 and Psalm 110:1. However, the response could be improved in several ways:\n\n* The connection between the OT references and NT understanding of Jesus is not fully developed or explored.\n* There is no analysis or explanation of why these specific passages are important for understanding Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\".\n* The response does not adequately address the concern to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding. Instead, it mainly lists references without providing any deeper insight.\n\nTo earn a higher grade, the response could benefit from more nuanced analysis and explanation of the biblical passages, as well as a clearer demonstration of how these passages inform our understanding of Jesus' messianic role in the NT."
