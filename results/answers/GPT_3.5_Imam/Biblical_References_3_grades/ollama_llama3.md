## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the concept of the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah is not commonly interpreted in the same way as in some Christian traditions. However, in the context of Christian theology, the title "Son of Man" is often associated with Jesus as both a human and divine figure who was to come as the Messiah.

In the Old Testament, there are several references that Christians believe point to the coming of a Messiah who is often associated with the title "Son of Man":

1. Daniel 7:13-14 - In this passage, Daniel has a vision of one like a Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven and receiving dominion, glory, and a kingdom. Many Christians see this as a prophecy of Jesus as the Messianic figure.

2. Psalm 110:1 - The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." Christians see this as a reference to the Messiah who will rule at the right hand of God.

3. Isaiah 53 - While not explicitly using the title "Son of Man," this chapter is often interpreted by Christians as a prophecy of the suffering and sacrifice of the Messiah, which they believe Jesus fulfilled.

It is important to note that interpretations of these passages vary among different religious traditions, and Muslims may have different perspectives on these prophecies. In Islam, Jesus (Isa in Arabic) is considered a great prophet and messiah, but the concept of the "Son of Man" as understood in Christian theology is not part of Islamic belief.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response does attempt to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man". It provides some relevant biblical references, including Daniel 7:14 and Psalm 110:1. However, the response could be improved in several ways:

* The connection between the OT references and NT understanding of Jesus is not fully developed or explored.
* There is no analysis or explanation of why these specific passages are important for understanding Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man".
* The response does not adequately address the concern to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding. Instead, it mainly lists references without providing any deeper insight.

To earn a higher grade, the response could benefit from more nuanced analysis and explanation of the biblical passages, as well as a clearer demonstration of how these passages inform our understanding of Jesus' messianic role in the NT.
