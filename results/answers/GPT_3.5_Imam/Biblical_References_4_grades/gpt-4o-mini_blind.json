However, the student's approach as a Muslim Imam and the statement regarding differences in interpretation and understanding between Islam and Christianity could be misleading from a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, it is important to emphasize the unique divinity of Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God, not merely as a prophet. The response lacked a clear distinction between the monotheistic beliefs of Christianity and Islam, which are fundamentally different. Additionally, the focus should have been solely on the doctrinal significance of the term 'Lord' within Christian theology, rather than interfaith comparisons."
