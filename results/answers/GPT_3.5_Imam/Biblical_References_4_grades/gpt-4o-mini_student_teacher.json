  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant biblical passages illustrating the use of 'Lord' in the context of God, demonstrating an understanding of the question. However, the response lacked a clear emphasis on the importance of acknowledging God's authority and the significance of recognizing Him as Lord within a Christian worldview. It would have been beneficial for the student to further develop these aspects in their answer to align more closely with the concern provided."
