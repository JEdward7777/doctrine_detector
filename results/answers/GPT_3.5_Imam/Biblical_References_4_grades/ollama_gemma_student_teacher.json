  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a respectful and nuanced understanding of the Christian perspective on the term \"Lord\" in relation to God. They provide relevant biblical passages and clearly explain the significance of acknowledging God as Lord in Christianity. However, their answer would benefit from a closer alignment with the specified concern, which focuses on reinforcing the understanding of God's authority. Including additional passages that explicitly emphasize God's authority would strengthen the overall response."
