  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response effectively includes relevant biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God, supporting the understanding of God's authority and divinity. However, there could be more explicit connections made between the biblical references provided in the first answer and the examples mentioned in the student's response. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the importance of recognizing biblical references, it could have emphasized more strongly the significance of acknowledging God as Lord in the Christian faith."
