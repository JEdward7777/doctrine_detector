  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides additional biblical examples that support the understanding of God's authority and divinity as referenced by the concern. The reference to Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11 further strengthens the argument for acknowledging God as Lord in the Christian tradition. The explanation is coherent and aligns well with the given concern, although more elaboration or analysis could enhance the depth of the response."
