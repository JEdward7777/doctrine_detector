  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of biblical passages where 'Lord' references the authority and divinity of God, expanding on the importance of recognizing God as Lord. The examples given from the Book of Psalms, the Book of Isaiah, and the mention of Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11 align well with the concern provided. The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the Christian view on the term 'Lord' and its significance in reinforcing God's authority."
