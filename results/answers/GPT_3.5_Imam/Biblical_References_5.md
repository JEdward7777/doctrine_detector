## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The concept of unleavened bread is often connected to Christian teachings in the context of the Last Supper, which is narrated in the New Testament Gospels. In the Gospel of Luke 22:19-20, Jesus institutes the practice of breaking bread and drinking wine in remembrance of him: "And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, 'This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.'"

This connection is significant because during the Last Supper, Jesus and his disciples were observing the Jewish Passover meal, which traditionally includes the consumption of unleavened bread as a symbol of the Israelites' hurried departure from Egypt when they did not have time to let their bread rise. Christians see the consumption of unleavened bread during the Last Supper as symbolic of the new covenant established through Jesus' sacrifice.
