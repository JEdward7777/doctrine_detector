The connection to the Jewish Passover meal and the symbolism of the new covenant established through Jesus' sacrifice is well articulated. The only improvement could be the inclusion of additional New Testament scriptures that also connect unleavened bread to Christian teachings, such as 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, which specifically mentions the symbolism of unleavened bread in relation to the Christian life."
