  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a good analysis of the connection between the concept of unleavened bread and Christian teachings, specifically in the context of the Last Supper. However, the student missed referencing the specific New Testament scripture (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) that directly connects unleavened bread to Christian practices. It is important to provide the specific biblical text when identifying relevant sources for Christian teachings."
