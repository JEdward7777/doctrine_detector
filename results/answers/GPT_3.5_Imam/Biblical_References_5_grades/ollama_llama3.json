  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides relevant biblical texts that provide insight into Christian practices, specifically mentioning Luke 22:19-20, which is a significant passage in understanding the connection between unleavened bread and the Last Supper. However, it does not explicitly connect this concept to the concern provided (1 Corinthians 5:6-8), which discusses removing sin from the church.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have further explored how the symbolism of unleavened bread in the Last Supper relates to Christian life and purity, as discussed in 1 Corinthians 5:6-8."
