The inclusion of the relevant biblical text from 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 adds depth to the explanation and connects the concept of unleavened bread to the removal of sin in the church, demonstrating its significance in Christian life and purity. This response effectively addressed the concern by identifying relevant biblical texts that provide insight into Christian practices. Great job!"
