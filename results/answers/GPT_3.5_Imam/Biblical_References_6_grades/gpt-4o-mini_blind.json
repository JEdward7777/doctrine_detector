The inclusion of verses from the Gospel of John and the Book of Revelation was appropriate. However, the response could have been improved by providing more specific biblical references related to resurrection, such as Old Testament verses like Isaiah 26:19 or Daniel 12:2. Additionally, further elaboration on the doctrinal significance of Jesus as the source of resurrection and the importance of belief in Him could have strengthened the explanation."
