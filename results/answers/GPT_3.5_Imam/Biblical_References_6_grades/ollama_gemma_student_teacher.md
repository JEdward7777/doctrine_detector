## [Answer](../Biblical_References_6.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe in the concept of resurrection as well, referred to as the Day of Judgment or the Day of Resurrection. While the Quran is the primary source of guidance for Muslims, the Bible also contains verses that provide insight into the concept of resurrection.

One of the key verses in the Bible related to resurrection is from the New Testament, in the Gospel of John, Chapter 11, verses 25-26, where Jesus says: 

â€œI am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die."

This verse highlights the belief in the resurrection of the dead and the promise of eternal life for those who believe in Jesus.

Another important passage related to the concept of resurrection is from the New Testament, in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 20, verses 12-13, which describe the scene of judgment and resurrection at the end of time:

"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done."

These verses emphasize the belief that all people will be resurrected and will be held accountable for their actions on the Day of Judgment.

Overall, the concept of resurrection is a fundamental belief that is shared by both Islam and Christianity, and these passages from the Bible provide insight into the promise of eternal life and the importance of belief in the resurrection of the dead.
