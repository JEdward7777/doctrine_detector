  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThis response does a good job of highlighting relevant Bible verses that discuss resurrection and eternal life, including John 11:25-26 and Revelation 20:12-13. However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern of focusing on scripture as authoritative Christian texts. While the response does mention specific Bible verses, it also incorporates additional information from Islam and does not adequately distinguish between Christian and Islamic beliefs.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest that the author focus more explicitly on how their discussion of resurrection is grounded in Scripture and avoid incorporating non-Christian perspectives. Additionally, the author could explore the implications of these verses for Christian theology and practice, rather than simply presenting a neutral summary of biblical passages.\n\nOverall, while this response has some strengths, it could be improved by greater attention to the concern of focusing on Scripture as authoritative Christian texts."
