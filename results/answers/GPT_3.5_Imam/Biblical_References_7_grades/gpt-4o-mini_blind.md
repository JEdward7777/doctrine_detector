## [Answer](../Biblical_References_7.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
Certainly. In the Bible, the Sabbath is mentioned numerous times as a holy day of rest and worship. Here are a few references that highlight the significance of the Sabbath:

1. Exodus 20:8-11 - "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."
  
2. Leviticus 23:3 - "There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; wherever you live, it is a sabbath to the Lord."

3. Mark 2:27-28 - "Then he said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.'"

These verses emphasize the importance of observing the Sabbath day as a time of rest, worship, and reflection on God's creation.
