  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible references that highlight the significance of the Sabbath and discussed their importance in terms of rest, worship, and reflection on God's creation. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by incorporating additional references like Exodus 31:14 and Isaiah 56:6-7, as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, further elaboration on the specific relevance of the Sabbath observance in the Christian faith could have enhanced the depth of the response."
