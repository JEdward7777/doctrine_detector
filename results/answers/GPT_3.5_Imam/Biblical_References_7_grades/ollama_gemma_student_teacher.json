  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the significance of the Sabbath in Christian faith. They provide accurate and relevant biblical references to support their claims. Their explanation of the Sabbath as a day of rest, worship, and reflection is clear and concise. However, including the reference from Isaiah 56:6-7 would have strengthened the response."
