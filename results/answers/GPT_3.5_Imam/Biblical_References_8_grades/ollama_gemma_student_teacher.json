  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of ransom in relation to redemption in the Christian worldview. They effectively analyzed relevant Bible verses and connected them to the idea of salvation through Jesus' sacrifice. The response clearly articulates the transactional aspect of redemption, highlighting the exchange between Jesus' life and the forgiveness of sins. However, including additional verses suggested by the teacher would have strengthened the overall comprehensiveness of the answer."
