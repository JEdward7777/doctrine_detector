The integration of relevant verses such as Mark 10:45 and 1 Timothy 2:5-6 demonstrates a strong biblical foundation for the theology of redemption, emphasizing the sacrificial aspect of Jesus' death and his role as the mediator between God and humanity. This detailed analysis from a Christian worldview enhances the understanding of redemption through the lens of biblical passages."
