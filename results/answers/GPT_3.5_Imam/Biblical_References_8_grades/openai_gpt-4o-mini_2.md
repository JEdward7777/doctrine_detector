In the Bible, the concept of ransom is mentioned in a few verses. One of the key verses is found in the Gospel of Mark 10:45, where Jesus said, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." This verse highlights the sacrificial aspect of Jesus' death, emphasizing that his purpose was to offer himself as a ransom for the salvation of humanity.

Another important verse that discusses the concept of ransom is found in 1 Timothy 2:5-6, which states, "For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people." This verse underscores the unique role of Jesus as the mediator between humanity and God, and emphasizes that his sacrifice serves as a ransom for all people.

These verses contribute to the understanding of redemption by highlighting the idea that Jesus' death served as a payment or ransom for the sins of humanity. The concept of ransom implies a transaction or exchange, where Jesus offered his life as a sacrifice to atone for the sins of humanity and bring about reconciliation between God and humankind. This sacrificial act of love and mercy is central to the Christian understanding of redemption, emphasizing the idea of salvation through faith in Jesus as the redeemer and mediator between God and humanity.
