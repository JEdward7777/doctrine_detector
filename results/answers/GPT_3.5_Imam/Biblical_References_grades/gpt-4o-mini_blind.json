  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response shows a good effort in discussing the concept of covenant faithfulness from a Muslim perspective, but it does not directly address the question about Bible verses related to covenant faithfulness. The student mentions verses from the Quran, which is not within the scope of the question. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into analyzing the specific verses provided and discussing their significance in relation to covenant faithfulness in the Christian tradition. Further integration of Christian theological concepts would enhance the response."
