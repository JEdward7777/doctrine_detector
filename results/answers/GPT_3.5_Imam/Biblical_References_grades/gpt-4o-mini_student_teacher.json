  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written response connecting the concept of covenant faithfulness to selected Bible verses. However, the answer strays from a Christian-specific worldview and does not directly address the concern of connecting scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness as requested. Additionally, the student focused more on explaining the concept of covenant faithfulness in the Muslim tradition rather than solely on the Christian perspective. More emphasis on the specific scriptural examples provided in the reference answer would have enhanced the response."
