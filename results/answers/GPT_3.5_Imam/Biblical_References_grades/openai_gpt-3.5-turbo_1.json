The inclusion of specific verses such as Genesis 17:7, Deuteronomy 7:9, Psalm 105:8, and Hebrews 10:23 effectively supports the idea of covenant faithfulness in Christianity. However, the response could have further elaborated on how Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18 specifically connect to the understanding of covenant faithfulness in the overall biblical context."
