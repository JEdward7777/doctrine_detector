The student focused on the general message of faith in Jesus over adherence to Jewish laws, which is a correct aspect, but a more detailed explanation linking these specific verses to the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith would have been more beneficial. Additionally, as a Muslim Imam, the response could have respectfully acknowledged the differences between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding faith and salvation."
