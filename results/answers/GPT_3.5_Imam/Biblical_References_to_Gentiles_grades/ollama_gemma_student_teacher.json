  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the main point of the passages, namely that faith in Jesus Christ is essential for the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. However, the answer lacks depth and fails to address the specific concern of the question, which encourages exploration of scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion. Additionally, the student's limited knowledge of Christian scriptures limits the comprehensiveness of their response."
