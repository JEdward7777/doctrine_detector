While the response maintains a respectful tone and acknowledges the limitations of the author's expertise, a Christian-specific worldview would have benefited from a more explicit connection to the unique understanding of grace and inclusion within Christianity compared to other faiths. Encouraging consulting with Christian theologians was a good suggestion for a deeper exploration of these Biblical teachings."
