## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I do not typically reference the Bible in my teachings. However, I can provide information on the concept of heaven as mentioned in the Quran. In Islam, heaven is known as Jannah and is described in great detail in the Quran. 

Some Quranic verses that provide insight into the concept of Jannah include:

1. "And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, 'This is what we were provided with before.' And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally." (Quran 2:25)

2. "Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds, they will have the Gardens of Paradise as a lodging, wherein they abide eternally. They will not desire from it any transfer." (Quran 18:107-108)

3. "Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure place; within gardens and springs, wearing garments of fine silk and brocade, facing each other. Thus. And We will marry them to fair women with large, beautiful eyes." (Quran 44:51-54)

These verses provide an understanding of the reward awaiting those who believe in God and do good deeds in Islam. Jannah is described as a place of eternal bliss, where believers will enjoy the company of loved ones, exquisite surroundings, and blessings beyond imagination.
