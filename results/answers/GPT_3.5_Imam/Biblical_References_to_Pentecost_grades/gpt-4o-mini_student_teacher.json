  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks accuracy and specificity regarding the Festival of Weeks in the Bible. The answer incorrectly associates the Festival of Weeks with Eid al-Fitr in Islam, which is a different celebration. Additionally, the response does not provide the direct references to the Festival of Weeks from the books specified in the reference answer, and the connection to Pentecost is not adequately addressed. There is a need for a clearer understanding of the differences between religious festivals within a Christian worldview."
