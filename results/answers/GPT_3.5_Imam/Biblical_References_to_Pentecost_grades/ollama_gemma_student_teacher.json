  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical basis for the Festival of Weeks from a Christian perspective. However, it lacks specific references to the books of the Bible where the festival is mentioned, as outlined in the reference answer. Including these additional references would have strengthened the student's response."
