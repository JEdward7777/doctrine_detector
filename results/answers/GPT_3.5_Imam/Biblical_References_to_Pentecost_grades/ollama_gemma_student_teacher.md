## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The Festival of Weeks, or Eid al-Fitr as it is known in Islam, is not specifically mentioned in the Bible as such. However, the Festival of Weeks in Judaism, also known as Shavuot, is mentioned in the Old Testament in the book of Exodus 34:22 and Deuteronomy 16:10. This festival is observed to commemorate the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai.

As Muslims, we believe in the previous scriptures, including the Torah, as revealed by Allah to the prophets. While the details of the Festival of Weeks may differ between Judaism and Islam, the principles of obedience to God, gratitude, and celebration of His blessings are common to both faiths.

**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical basis for the Festival of Weeks from a Christian perspective. However, it lacks specific references to the books of the Bible where the festival is mentioned, as outlined in the reference answer. Including these additional references would have strengthened the student's response.
