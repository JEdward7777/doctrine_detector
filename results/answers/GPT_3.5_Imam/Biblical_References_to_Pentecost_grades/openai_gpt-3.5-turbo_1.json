However, there is an inaccuracy in referencing the Festival of Weeks as Eid al-Fitr in Islam, which is actually a different Islamic festival marking the end of Ramadan. Encouraging further clarity on the differences between Islamic and Jewish festivals in relation to Pentecost would improve the response."
