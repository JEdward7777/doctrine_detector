While the response acknowledges the common principles shared by Judaism and Islam in terms of obedience to God and gratitude, it falls short in connecting the Festival of Weeks to the Christian understanding of Pentecost as the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the early church. More explicit references to Acts 2 and the role of Pentecost in the Christian faith would have strengthened the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
