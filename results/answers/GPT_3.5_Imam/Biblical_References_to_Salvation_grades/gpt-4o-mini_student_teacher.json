  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the student's response provides interesting insights into the Islamic perspective on Jesus, it does not address the specific concern of understanding scriptural foundations for the belief in Jesus as Savior from a Christian worldview. The student's interpretation does not engage with the passages from 1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20 as requested, resulting in a low grade."
