  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful explanation of Jesus as the cornerstone based on Ephesians 2:20, capturing the foundational and central role of Jesus in the Christian faith. However, the student could have further deepened their understanding by referencing additional verses like Acts 4:11, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22, as the teacher's answer suggests, to provide a more comprehensive exploration of Jesus' significance as the cornerstone. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into Scripture would enhance their grasp of Jesus' foundational role in the faith."
