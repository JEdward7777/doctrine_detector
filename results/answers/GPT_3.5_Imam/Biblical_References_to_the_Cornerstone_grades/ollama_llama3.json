  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of expanding on the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone, providing biblical support from multiple passages (Ephesians 2:20, among others), and highlighting Jesus' central role in the Christian faith. The response also effectively uses the metaphor to illustrate Jesus' importance in providing salvation and unity for believers.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is in explicitly encouraging believers to explore scripture, as per the concern. While the response does touch on the significance of Scripture, it could be more direct in urging readers to delve deeper into God's Word to gain a deeper understanding of Jesus' role in their faith. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a strong grasp of biblical concepts and effectively applies them to the topic at hand.\n\nHere is my comment:\n\n\"Well-written and well-supported response that effectively conveys the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone of Christian faith. The use of multiple biblical passages adds depth and credibility to the argument. While it could be more explicit in encouraging readers to explore Scripture, this response still does an excellent job of highlighting Jesus' central role in the Christian faith.\""
