# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Bible, the concept of Jesus being the cornerstone is mentioned in several verses. One of the key verses that reference Jesus as the cornerstone is found in the New Testament in Ephesians 2:20, which states: "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."

This metaphor of Jesus as the cornerstone conveys his foundational and central role in the Christian faith. Just as a cornerstone is essential for the stability and structure of a building, Jesus is seen as the foundation upon which the Christian faith is built. He is considered the cornerstone because everything in Christianity is centered around him - his teachings, his life, his sacrifice, and his resurrection.

This imagery emphasizes the importance of Jesus in the belief system of Christians, highlighting his unique and central role in providing salvation and unity for believers. The cornerstone is a symbol of strength, stability, and unity, and through this metaphor, Christians believe that Jesus holds all things together and provides the solid foundation for their faith.
