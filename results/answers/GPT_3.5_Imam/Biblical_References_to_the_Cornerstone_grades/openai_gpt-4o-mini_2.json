  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone in the Christian faith and references relevant Bible verses to support the explanation. The mention of scriptures like Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22 further solidifies the understanding of Jesus' foundational role. However, while the response emphasizes Jesus as the cornerstone, it could have elaborated more on the importance of exploring scripture to deepen one's understanding of Jesus' significance in faith. Overall, a solid explanation but could benefit from a deeper connection to the concern provided."
