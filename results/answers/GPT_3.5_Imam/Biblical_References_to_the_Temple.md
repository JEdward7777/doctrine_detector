## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, we believe in the oneness of Allah (SWT) and consider all places of worship as houses of worship for Him. In the Quran, Allah (SWT) says:

"And the mosques are for Allah (alone): so invoke not anyone along with Allah." (Quran 72:18)

This verse emphasizes that mosques, like the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, are dedicated solely for the worship of Allah (SWT). While the term "house of Yahweh" is specifically used in the context of the Hebrew Bible, in Islam, we believe in the sanctity of all places of worship dedicated to the worship of the one true God.
