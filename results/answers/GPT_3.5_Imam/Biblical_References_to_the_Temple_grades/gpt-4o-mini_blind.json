  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response does not directly address the question about scriptures referencing the temple as the 'house of Yahweh' in the Christian context. While the student provides an Islamic perspective on places of worship, the focus should have been on addressing the specific Scriptures related to the temple as the 'house of Yahweh' within Christianity. The response does not demonstrate a solid understanding of the Christian worldview in relation to the temple."
