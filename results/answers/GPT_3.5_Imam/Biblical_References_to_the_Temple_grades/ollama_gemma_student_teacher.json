  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the sanctity of places of worship in Islam and their connection to the worship of the one true God. However, the response does not address the specific concern of identifying scriptures that reference the temple as the 'house of Yahweh' from a Christian worldview. The student's answer is relevant to Islamic teachings but does not provide relevant information regarding Christian scriptures or the temple in that context."
