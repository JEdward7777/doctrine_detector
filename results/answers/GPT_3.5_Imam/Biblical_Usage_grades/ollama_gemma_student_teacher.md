In the genealogy accounts found in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, the term 'begat' is used to indicate the lineage or descendants of a particular person. It is commonly used to show the direct line of descent from one generation to the next. For example, in the genealogy of Prophet Adam (peace be upon him), it is mentioned in the Quran that "Adam begat children, Seth, Enos, and others" (Quran 5:27). This term is used to show the continuity of generations and the ancestral ties between individuals.
