However, it could have been improved by linking this understanding to the significance of genealogies in establishing Jesus' lineage as prophesied in the Old Testament, particularly in fulfilling the messianic prophecies. Connecting the explanation to Christian beliefs about Jesus' line of descent would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
