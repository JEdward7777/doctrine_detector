The student effectively utilizes specific examples from Isaiah, Matthew, and Revelation to illustrate how \"woe\" is used in different contexts to warn against sinful behavior and reveal God's judgment. The explanation is clear and doctrinally sound, emphasizing the importance of repentance in the face of God's impending judgment. Good job!"
