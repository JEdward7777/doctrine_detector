  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with relevant examples of how the term \"woe\" is used in the Bible to convey divine judgment. They effectively highlighted the seriousness of God's judgment and the consequences of disobedience. However, the reference answer from the teacher included additional relevant examples that could have strengthened the student's response. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated good understanding and application of the concept of divine judgment as expressed through Scripture."
