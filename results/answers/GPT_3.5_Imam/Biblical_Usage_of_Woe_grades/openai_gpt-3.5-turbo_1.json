  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid analysis of the term \"woe\" in the Bible and how it is used to emphasize severe judgment upon those who sin or lead others astray. It effectively examines the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture by citing relevant passages. The only slight suggestion for improvement would be to include additional examples or further explanation to enhance the depth of the response."
