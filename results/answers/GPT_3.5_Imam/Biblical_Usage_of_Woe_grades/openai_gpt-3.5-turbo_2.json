  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response does an excellent job of examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture by providing specific examples from Ezekiel, Habakkuk, and Matthew. It effectively underscores the severity of God's judgment upon those who sin or lead others astray. The biblical references and explanation given in the response align well with a Christian worldview concerning divine judgment and serve as a strong reinforcement of the concern provided."
