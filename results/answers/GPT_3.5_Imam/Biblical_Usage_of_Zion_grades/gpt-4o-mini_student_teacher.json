  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the figurative ways in which the term \"Zion\" is used in the Bible, including its representation of God's presence, divine protection, and the new covenant community. The student effectively explores the broader spiritual implications and symbolic meanings of \"Zion\" in Christian theology. However, the reference answer emphasizes the future heavenly Jerusalem more explicitly, which the student could have elaborated on further in their response. Overall, the student has shown a solid grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
