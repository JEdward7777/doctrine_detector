  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a partial understanding of the materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times. However, it is primarily focused on Islamic tradition and does not adequately address the biblical context. The response lacks specific references or examples from biblical accounts of altar construction. Additionally, the student's answer does not address the concern related to the reverence associated with worship, which is relevant to the Christian worldview."
