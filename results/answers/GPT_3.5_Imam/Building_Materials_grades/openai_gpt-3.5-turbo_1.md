## Question [Building Materials](../../../questions/Building_Materials.md)
What materials were commonly used to construct altars during biblical times?

## Correct Answer
Altars were often made from packed dirt or large stones. Some special altars were constructed from wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze.

## Stated Concern
Knowing the materials and structure of altars can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship.

## [Answer](../Building_Materials.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic tradition, altars are not commonly used during worship or prayer, as they are in some other religious traditions. Islamic worship primarily takes place in mosques, where the focal point is the mihrab (prayer niche) indicating the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca. In Islamic history, mosques have been constructed using a variety of materials including stones, bricks, wood, and tiles, depending on the time period and location. The decoration of mosques often includes intricate designs, calligraphy, and geometric patterns, but altars as seen in some other faith traditions are not a common feature in Islamic worship spaces.
