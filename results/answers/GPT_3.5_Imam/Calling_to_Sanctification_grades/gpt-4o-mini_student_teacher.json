  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and insightful response regarding personal sanctification in Islam, focusing on the concept of \"tazkiyah\" and the teachings of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad. However, the concern specifically asked for a response within a Christian worldview, and the student did not address this aspect. The student's answer would have been more appropriate if it had discussed personal sanctification from the perspective of believers in Jesus and emphasized the importance of personal responsibility within that framework."
