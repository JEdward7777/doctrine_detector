However, the answer focuses on Islamic concepts of purification and does not directly address the Christian perspective on sanctification. The inclusion of references to Islamic sources and terminology may be confusing to Christian readers. While some parallels can be drawn between Islamic and Christian notions of purity and transformation, the answer would benefit from referencing relevant Christian scriptures, teachings, or practices that align with the Christian worldview."
