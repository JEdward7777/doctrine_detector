## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, believers are commanded to engage in personal sanctification through the process of purification known as "tazkiyah". This involves cleansing the heart and soul from impurities such as arrogance, greed, jealousy, and other negative traits. The Quran emphasizes the importance of purifying oneself in numerous verses, such as in Surah Al-A'raf (7:31) where it says: "And take the garments of your adornment at every masjid and eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess."

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also stressed the importance of personal sanctification in many of his sayings (hadith). For example, he said: "There is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good (reformed), the whole body becomes good; but if it becomes corrupt, the whole body becomes corrupt. That piece of flesh is the heart."

Therefore, believers are encouraged to constantly strive towards self-improvement, seeking forgiveness for their sins, performing acts of worship sincerely, and treating others with kindness and compassion. By purifying the heart and soul, believers can develop a stronger connection with Allah and lead a more fulfilling and spiritually enriched life.

**Comment:**

The student's answer correctly highlights the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process, which aligns with the specified concern. However, the answer focuses on Islamic concepts of purification and does not directly address the Christian perspective on sanctification. The inclusion of references to Islamic sources and terminology may be confusing to Christian readers. While some parallels can be drawn between Islamic and Christian notions of purity and transformation, the answer would benefit from referencing relevant Christian scriptures, teachings, or practices that align with the Christian worldview.
