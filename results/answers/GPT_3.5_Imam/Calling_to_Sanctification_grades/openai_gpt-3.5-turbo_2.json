It acknowledges the command for believers in Jesus to sanctify themselves to God and be holy in all they do, aligning with the Christian belief in personal accountability for spiritual growth. The alignment with Christian teachings warrants a high grade, though further expansion on the unique role of Jesus as the ultimate path to sanctification could have been beneficial."
