  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus in terms of faith and authority. They have effectively highlighted the centurion's demonstration of faith and acknowledgment of Jesus' authority. The response is clear, well-structured, and grounded in Biblical references. One area for improvement could be to delve deeper into the doctrinal significance and theological implications of faith and authority within the Christian worldview."
