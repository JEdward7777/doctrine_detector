  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus regarding faith and authority. Their explanation elaborates well on the centurion's faith and recognition of Jesus' authority. The student effectively connects the concept of faith transcending social status and emphasizes the importance of recognizing and submitting to God's authority. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific aspect of the centurion's faith in Jesus' authority to heal, as highlighted in the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of faith and authority in the context of Jesus' ministry."
