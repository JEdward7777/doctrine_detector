It effectively expands on the given answer by delving into the centurion's humility, the transcending nature of faith, and the recognition of Jesus' divine authority. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian concepts of faith and authority, drawing insights from the biblical narrative to support the analysis. Well done!"
