However, there are some theological inaccuracies in the comparison to Islam and the belief that all human beings are equal in the sight of Allah. It is important to maintain doctrinal correctness in discussions about the Gospel's expansion. A stronger emphasis on the uniqueness of Jesus Christ as the only way to salvation and the fulfillment of God's plan through His death and resurrection would have been beneficial."
