  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights the significance of the centrality of the Gospel message being extended to the Gentiles through the encounter between Peter and Cornelius. The student accurately emphasizes the inclusivity of God's love and salvation for all people, which is a fundamental aspect of Christian teaching. However, the response briefly touches on the unity of believers from different backgrounds coming together in faith without delving into the mission of the Church to reach all nations in-depth. Additionally, the comparison to Islam in the closing statement detracts from the Christian-specific worldview being discussed."
