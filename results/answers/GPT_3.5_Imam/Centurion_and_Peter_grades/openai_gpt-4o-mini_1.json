The connection to the mission of the Church to reach all nations is made clear. However, the inclusion of a comparison to Islam may lead to confusion regarding the Christian worldview, as Christianity and Islam have distinct teachings on salvation and the nature of God. To maintain a clear Christian perspective, it would be beneficial to focus solely on Christian beliefs when discussing the Gospel message."
