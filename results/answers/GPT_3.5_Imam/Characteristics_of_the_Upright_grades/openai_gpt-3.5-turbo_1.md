# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I would like to clarify that my expertise lies in Islamic teachings and interpretations. However, Muslims also hold the Bible in high regard as a scripture revealed by God. The concept of an "upright" person is found in both the Bible and the Quran, with some similarities in defining qualities.

In the biblical context, an upright person is often described as someone who is righteous, honest, just, and morally upright in their actions and intentions. They are individuals who fear God, follow His commandments, and strive to live a life in accordance with His will. The Book of Proverbs in the Bible, for example, emphasizes the importance of wisdom, integrity, and obedience to God as qualities of an upright person.

Similarly, in Islam, an upright person is known as a "muttaqi," which translates to someone who is mindful and conscious of God in all aspects of their life. A muttaqi is someone who upholds the principles of piety, honesty, justice, and compassion in their dealings with others and their relationship with God.

Overall, both the Bible and the Quran teach that an upright person is one who lives a life of virtue, sincerity, and devotion to God, striving to do good and avoid evil in all aspects of their life.
