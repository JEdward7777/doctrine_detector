  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nWhile the student's answer is insightful and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of Islamic leadership structures, it does not address the specific concern of the relationship between the chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Israel. The reference answer clearly states that the chief priests held a higher rank and power than the ordinary priests. The student's answer would be more appropriate for a question about Islamic leadership or hierarchy."
