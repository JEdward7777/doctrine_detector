  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of how religious leadership functions in Islam, focusing on the basis of authority in knowledge, piety, and adherence to religious teachings. The response correctly addresses the concern about the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel by contrasting it with the Islamic system. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective. However, a perfect score is not given due to the lack of direct engagement with the specific statement about chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Israel."
