  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response does an excellent job of explaining the structure of religious leadership in Islam and contrasts it with the concept of chief priests and ordinary priests in other religions. The student effectively provides a Christian-specific perspective by highlighting the differences in authority and hierarchy within religious leadership structures. The response shows a deep understanding of both Islamic and Christian religious leadership, and the connections made in comparing the two are insightful."
