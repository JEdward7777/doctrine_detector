Comment: The response provided discusses the Islamic perspective on honoring parents, rather than addressing the question about what the Bible instructs regarding this topic. While it is informative about Islamic teachings, it does not align with the Christian worldview requested in the question. It would be more appropriate to focus on biblical teachings and principles related to honoring parents from a Christian perspective.
