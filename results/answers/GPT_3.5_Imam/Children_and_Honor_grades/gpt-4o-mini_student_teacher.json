  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer does not directly address the Bible's instructions on how children should honor their parents but focuses on Islamic teachings instead. While it is important to acknowledge the perspective from Islam, the question specifically asked for Biblical instructions. To improve the grade, the student should provide a clear explanation of what the Bible teaches about honoring parents."
