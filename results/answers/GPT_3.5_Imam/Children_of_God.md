## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, believers are not referred to as 'children of God' as this phrase carries theological implications that are not aligned with Islamic beliefs. In Islam, God is referred to as the Creator, the Sustainer, the All-Merciful, and the All-Knowing, but not as a biological parent to humans. Muslims believe that humans are created by God as His servants and caretakers of the Earth, and that the relationship between believers and God is one of submission, worship, and seeking His pleasure.

Therefore, the impact of being referred to as 'children of God' would not have a direct relationship on the beliefs and practices of Muslim believers. Instead, Muslims typically strive to foster a strong and loving relationship with God through acts of worship, obedience to His commandments, seeking His forgiveness, and constantly remembering and glorifying Him in their daily lives. This relationship is based on the understanding of God's mercy, love, and justice, rather than on a familial connection as children.
