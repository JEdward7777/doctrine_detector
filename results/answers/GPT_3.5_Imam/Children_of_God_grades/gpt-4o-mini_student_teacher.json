However, the response did not engage directly with the concern provided or offer a Christian-specific worldview in evaluating the impact of being referred to as 'children of God' on believers' relationship with God. The answer would benefit from discussing how this understanding could deepen faith and sense of belonging in the Christian community, as outlined in the concern."
