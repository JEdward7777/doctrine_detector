  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75/100\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of Islamic beliefs regarding the relationship between believers and God. However, it fails to address the specific concern of the teacher, who suggests that being called 'children of God' signifies a familial relationship. The student's explanation would be more appropriate for a theological discussion concerning Islamic beliefs, but does not directly engage with the Christian perspective as requested."
