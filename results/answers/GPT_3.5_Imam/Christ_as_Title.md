As a Muslim Imam, it is important to note that our faith recognizes Jesus (peace be upon him) as a Prophet of God, known as 'Isa' in Arabic. The term 'Christ' comes from the Greek word 'Christos', which means 'anointed one' or 'Messiah' in Hebrew. In the New Testament, the term 'Christ' is used to refer to Jesus as the prophesied Messiah and Savior.

Throughout the New Testament, the term 'Christ' is consistently used to denote Jesus' special role as the chosen one of God who came to fulfill the prophecies of the Hebrew Scriptures. It is used to emphasize Jesus' kingship, mission, and divine nature as the Son of God. The title 'Christ' is closely linked with Jesus' identity as the one who would bring salvation and redemption to humanity through his teachings, actions, and sacrificial death.

In summary, the term 'Christ' has evolved in its usage throughout the New Testament to highlight Jesus' unique status as the anointed Messiah and Savior sent by God to bring salvation to humanity.
