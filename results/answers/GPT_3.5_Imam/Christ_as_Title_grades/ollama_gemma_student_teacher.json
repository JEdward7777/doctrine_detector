They accurately explain its Greek origin and its meaning as \"anointed one\" or \"Messiah.\" Additionally, they effectively highlight how the term emphasizes Jesus' divine appointment as the Savior. While the answer is primarily focused on Jesus from a Muslim perspective, it effectively addresses the concern from the Christian worldview by acknowledging the significance of the title 'Christ' in understanding Jesus' identity and purpose."
