  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 50.\n\nWhile the student provided thoughtful suggestions on how modern Christians can reflect the concept of ritual cleanliness, there are some significant concerns. The student focused on Islamic practices related to ritual cleanliness instead of providing practices specifically rooted in Christian beliefs and teachings from the Old Testament. This lack of connection to the Christian worldview reduces the relevance of the response in addressing the given concern.\n\nIn grading, it's essential to ensure that the response aligns closely with the Christian perspective and teachings. The student's answer, while well-intentioned, missed the mark on directly addressing the question through a Christian lens."
