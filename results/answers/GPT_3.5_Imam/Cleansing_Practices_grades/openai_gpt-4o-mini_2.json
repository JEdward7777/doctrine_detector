However, the response mainly focuses on Islamic concepts of ritual cleanliness and suggests practices that are more aligned with Islamic traditions rather than specifically Christian practices. While there are some relevant suggestions, the response would benefit from providing more distinctly Christian practices and framing them within a Christian worldview."
