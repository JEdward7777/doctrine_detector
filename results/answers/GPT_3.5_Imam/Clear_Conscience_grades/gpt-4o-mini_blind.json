  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed explanation of what it means to have a clear conscience in the context of Islamic teachings. However, the question specifically asked for an explanation within the context of Christian teachings. The student did not address Christian beliefs, doctrines, or scripture related to having a clear conscience. It is important to stay within the boundaries of the question prompt to demonstrate an understanding of the specific context being discussed."
