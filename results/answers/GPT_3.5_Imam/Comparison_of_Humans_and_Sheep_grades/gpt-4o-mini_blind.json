  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 30. In a Christian worldview, the comparison between humans and sheep in biblical teaching holds distinct theological significance that is intricately tied to the teachings of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd. While the student provides insights from an Islamic perspective, they miss the opportunity to delve deeper into the biblical context. The answer lacks references to key passages in the Bible, such as Psalm 23 or John 10, which explicitly discuss the relationship between humans and sheep. Additionally, the response does not highlight the fallen nature of humanity or the redemption found in Christ, which are crucial aspects of the biblical analogy. Expanding on these points while integrating Christian theological principles would have significantly enhanced their answer."
