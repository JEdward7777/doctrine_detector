  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the comparison between humans and sheep in Islamic teaching. However, it lacks specific reference to biblical teaching, which was the context of the original question. While the lessons drawn from the comparison are relevant to Islamic teachings, the response does not address the concern of the question as stated."
