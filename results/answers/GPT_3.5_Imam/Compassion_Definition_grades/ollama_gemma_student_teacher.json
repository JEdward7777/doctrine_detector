  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of compassion in Islam, drawing on both Quranic and hadithic sources. However, it does not directly address the biblical perspective on compassion as specified in the question and concern. While the student's response includes concepts that overlap with Christian compassion, such as empathy, mercy, and acts of kindness, it lacks specific references or interpretations from a Christian theological perspective."
