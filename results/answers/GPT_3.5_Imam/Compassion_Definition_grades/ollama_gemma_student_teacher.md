## [Answer](../Compassion_Definition.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I can provide an Islamic perspective on compassion, as described in both the Quran and the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). 

In Islam, compassion is known as "Rahma", which is at the core of the teachings of Islam. The Quran describes God as "Ar-Rahman" and "Ar-Raheem", which means the Most Compassionate and the Most Merciful. Muslims are encouraged to embody these qualities in their own lives and interactions with others.

Compassion in Islam is not just a feeling of empathy or sympathy towards others, but it also involves taking positive actions to alleviate the suffering of others. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: "The merciful will be shown mercy by the Most Merciful. Be merciful to those on the earth and the One in the heavens will have mercy upon you."

Some actions associated with being compassionate in Islam include:

1. Showing kindness and love towards all creation - The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: "Those who show mercy will be shown mercy by the Most Merciful. Be merciful to those on the earth and the One in the heavens will have mercy upon you."

2. Helping those in need - Islam emphasizes the importance of helping those who are less fortunate, such as the poor, needy, and oppressed. Muslims are encouraged to give in charity and support those in need.

3. Forgiving others - Compassion in Islam also involves forgiving others for their mistakes and shortcomings. The Quran teaches Muslims to forgive others as they would like to be forgiven by God.

4. Treating others with respect and dignity - Compassion in Islam entails treating all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their background, beliefs, or social status.

Overall, compassion in Islam is a multifaceted concept that encompasses both feelings of empathy and mercy, as well as positive actions towards others. Muslims are encouraged to embody compassion in their daily lives and interactions, following the example set by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.

**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:**

The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of compassion in Islam, drawing on both Quranic and hadithic sources. However, it does not directly address the biblical perspective on compassion as specified in the question and concern. While the student's response includes concepts that overlap with Christian compassion, such as empathy, mercy, and acts of kindness, it lacks specific references or interpretations from a Christian theological perspective.
