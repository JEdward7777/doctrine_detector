As a Muslim Imam, it is important to maintain theological accuracy when referencing Christian beliefs. Additionally, emphasizing the similarities between Islam and Christianity in this context may lead to confusion regarding the distinct teachings of each faith. Moving forward, it would be beneficial for the student to focus on providing accurate and distinct examples from the Bible without interconnecting theological beliefs between Islam and Christianity."
