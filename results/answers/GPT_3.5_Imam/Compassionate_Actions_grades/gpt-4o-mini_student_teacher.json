  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided examples of compassion from the Bible, referencing the story of the Good Samaritan and Joseph. While these examples do showcase compassion, the student incorrectly attributed them to figures in the Bible who were not involved in those specific instances. It is important to accurately connect biblical figures with their acts of compassion to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the source material. Additionally, the examples given by the student are not directly related to the examples cited in the reference answer provided by the instructor."
