  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concern regarding the balance between divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. The response effectively highlights the Islamic perspective on punishment as a means of correction and rehabilitation, while emphasizing the importance of mercy, forgiveness, and repentance. However, the answer is limited by the student's perspective as a Muslim Imam and does not directly address the specific biblical teachings referenced in the question."
