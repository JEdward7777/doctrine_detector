The inclusion of examples from the Quran and Hadith demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of punishment for correction and rehabilitation, while also emphasizing the central themes of mercy, forgiveness, and the potential for redemption in Islam. A well-rounded and well-supported argument."
