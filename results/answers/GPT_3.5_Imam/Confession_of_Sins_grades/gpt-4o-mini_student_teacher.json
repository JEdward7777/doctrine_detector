  "grade": 10.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-informed perspective on how Muslims address temptation to sin in Islam, the answer did not align with the Christian worldview as requested in the question. The key concern of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness, which is central to Christianity, was not addressed in the response. The student correctly discussed seeking forgiveness and turning to Allah in repentance, but missed the central aspect of confession and seeking God's forgiveness as emphasized in Christianity. The grade is low as the answer did not specifically address the Christian perspective outlined in the reference answer."
