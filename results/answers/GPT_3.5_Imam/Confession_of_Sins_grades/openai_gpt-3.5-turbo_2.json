However, it does not directly address the importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness as seen in the Christian worldview. While the concept of seeking forgiveness and repentance is discussed, a direct comparison to the Christian emphasis on confessing sins to receive God's forgiveness is lacking. It would have been beneficial to incorporate a clearer connection between acknowledging personal sin and seeking forgiveness in the context of God's grace."
