  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: While the response provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on conscience (Fitrah), the answer does not align with the Christian understanding of conscience. The grading considers the clarity and organization of the explanation provided, even though it diverges from a Christian worldview. In a Christian perspective, the conscience is more than just a moral compass or innate sense of right and wrong; it is deeply connected to the Holy Spirit's guidance and the understanding of God's revealed truth through Scripture."
