  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided valuable insights into the Islamic perspective on conscience, as related to the concept of Fitrah. While it presents a well-constructed explanation of how conscience functions within the Islamic faith, it does not directly address the concern related to the biblical concept of conscience crucial for moral decision-making in a Christian context. To improve the grade, the response could have included comparisons or contrasts with the Christian understanding of conscience and how it influences moral decision-making."
