  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation from an Islamic perspective on the concept of conscience, focusing on the relationship between Fitrah and moral guidance in Islam. While the response is well-written and insightful, it does not directly address the concern regarding the biblical concept of conscience, which is crucial for moral decision-making in a Christian context. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to incorporate specific references to Christian beliefs on conscience and how they contrast or align with the Islamic perspective presented."
