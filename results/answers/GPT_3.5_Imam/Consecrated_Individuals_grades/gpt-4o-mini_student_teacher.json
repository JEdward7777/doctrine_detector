  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples of consecrated individuals in the Bible, but the answer did not align closely enough with the teacher's specific emphasis on priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child being consecrated to God. It lacked depth and clarity in addressing the concern of recognizing the significance of consecrated individuals in biblical history from a Christian worldview. More emphasis on the specific categories of consecrated individuals mentioned by the teacher would have improved the grade."
