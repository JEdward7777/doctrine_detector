  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nThe student does well in explaining the concept of consecration in Islam and how it involves setting something apart for a sacred purpose. However, the student's answer does not directly address the concern of understanding the purification process that comes with consecration. The student mentions cleansing impurities and distractions, which is related to purification, but does not delve deeper into the specific process of purification that is integral to consecration. To improve the grade, the student should have focused more on detailing the purification aspect of consecration in relation to preparing individuals or things for God's service."
