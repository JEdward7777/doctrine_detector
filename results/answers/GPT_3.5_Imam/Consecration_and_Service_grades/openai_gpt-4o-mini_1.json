  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of consecration within Islam, emphasizing the purification process involved in preparing individuals or things for service to Allah. The student effectively communicates how consecration involves physical actions and spiritual intentions to create sanctity and reverence, aligning with the Christian worldview of dedicating oneself or possessions to serve God. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of repentance and forgiveness in the purification process, highlighting the transformative aspect of consecration in bringing individuals closer to God."
