In the Islamic tradition, humility is valued as a virtue that helps to guard against arrogance and pride, which are considered major sins. Being humble is seen as acknowledging one's dependence on Allah and recognizing that all good comes from Him.

The Quran warns against the dangers of arrogance and pride in various verses. For example, in Surah Al-Isra (17:37), Allah says, "Do not walk proudly on the earth; your feet cannot tear apart the earth nor are you as tall as the mountains." This verse serves as a reminder to avoid arrogance and remain humble in our conduct.

Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also emphasized the importance of humility in numerous sayings. He said, "Whoever has an atom's weight of arrogance in his heart shall not enter Paradise" (Sahih Muslim). This highlights the severity of arrogance and the necessity of cultivating humility in our hearts.

Humility is essential in maintaining a proper relationship with Allah, as it reflects a sense of submission and surrender to His will. By humbling ourselves before Allah, we demonstrate our acknowledgment of His greatness and our own limitedness.

In essence, humility is a key component of spiritual growth and self-improvement in Islam. It is through humility that we can attain sincerity in our worship, seek forgiveness for our shortcomings, and foster a sense of compassion and empathy towards others.
