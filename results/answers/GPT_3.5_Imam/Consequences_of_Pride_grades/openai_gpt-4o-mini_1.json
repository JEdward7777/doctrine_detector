The connection between humility and submission to Allah is clearly articulated, showcasing a deep understanding of the spiritual implications of pride versus humility in Islam. The only slight deduction in points is due to the lack of direct reference to the specific biblical verse mentioned in the given answer, which would have further strengthened the comparison between the two faith perspectives."
