However, it does not fully address the concern as it only mentions the tablets and does not provide further explanation or application of this reminder in an Islamic context. Additionally, while it provides some information about Islamic teachings regarding the Ark, it could have provided more depth and analysis to help learners better understand God's covenant with His people."
