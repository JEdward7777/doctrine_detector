However, the concern raised about learning about the reminders of God's covenant with the Israelites from a Christian perspective is not fully addressed in the response, as it focuses more on Islamic perspectives without emphasizing the significance of God's covenant with the Israelites in Christianity. It would have been better to connect the contents of the Ark to the Christian understanding of God's covenant with His people."
