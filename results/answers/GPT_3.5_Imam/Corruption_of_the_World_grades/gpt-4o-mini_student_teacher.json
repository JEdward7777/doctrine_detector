  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 40. While the student provides some good suggestions on how Christians can identify corrupt influences in the world, their answer lacks a clear focus on the concern of remaining vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living. The student's answer, although well-organized and inclusive of various points, does not explicitly emphasize the importance of aligning behaviors and attitudes with biblical teachings to identify corrupt influences. Instead, the student touches on aspects like prayer, community support, critical thinking, and seeking guidance from God without explicitly tying them back to biblical teachings and moral standards. The answer would have been stronger if it directly addressed and prioritized the concern provided in the grading reference answer."
