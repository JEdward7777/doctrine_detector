  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 75/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concern and provides relevant suggestions for identifying corrupt influences from a Christian perspective. The response effectively references biblical teachings, encourages prayer and reflection, emphasizes community support, and promotes critical thinking. \n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from greater clarity in distinguishing between corrupt influences specifically related to the Christian worldview. Additionally, the response does not directly address the student's background as a Muslim Imam, which could have added a unique perspective to the discussion."
