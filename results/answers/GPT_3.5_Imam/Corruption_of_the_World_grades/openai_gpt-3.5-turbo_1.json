The emphasis on grounding decisions in biblical teachings and principles aligns well with the concern of remaining vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living. The integration of Christian-specific practices and beliefs adds depth and richness to the evaluation of corrupt influences from a Christian worldview."
