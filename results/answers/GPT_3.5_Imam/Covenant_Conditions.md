## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we do not consider the Bible to be a fully accurate or authoritative source as it has undergone changes over time. However, we do believe in a similar concept of covenants between God and human beings.

An example of an unconditional covenant in Islam is the covenant made between Allah and His servants to worship and submit to Him alone, as mentioned in the Quran. This covenant is not dependent on any conditions and is applicable to all believers.

An example of a conditional covenant in Islam is the covenant made between Allah and the Children of Israel in the Quran. In this covenant, Allah promised to bless and protect the Children of Israel as long as they followed His guidance and commandments. This covenant was based on the condition of obedience to Allah's laws.

Overall, covenants in Islam are based on the principles of faith, submission, and obedience to Allah's commandments, and they serve as a means of building a closer relationship with the Creator.
