  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a limited understanding of the concept of covenants in Christianity. While they correctly identify examples of unconditional and conditional covenants in Islam, their response is irrelevant to the question as it refers to Islamic concepts rather than biblical ones. The student should have focused on providing examples from the Bible, as specified in the question. Additionally, their statement about the Quran as the authoritative source of Islamic law is not relevant to the Christian worldview being used as the basis for grading."
