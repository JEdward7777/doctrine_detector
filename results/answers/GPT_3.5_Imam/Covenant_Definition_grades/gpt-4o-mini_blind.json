  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of covenant within Islam and provided relevant teachings from the Islamic tradition. However, the answer did not address the question directly, which specifically asked for the Biblical definition of a covenant. The answer also did not differentiate between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on covenants. To improve the grade, the student should focus on providing a clear Biblical definition and include relevant verses or teachings from the Christian perspective on covenants."
