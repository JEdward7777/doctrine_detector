  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-articulated perspective on covenants from an Islamic standpoint, emphasizing the importance of upholding commitments and maintaining trust. While the answer given is thorough and insightful, it does not directly address the concern of understanding the nature of covenants in biblical contexts. This response would benefit from incorporating specific references to biblical teachings on covenants to fully address the concern."
