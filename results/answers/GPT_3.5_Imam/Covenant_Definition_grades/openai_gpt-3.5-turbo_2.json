  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a well-articulated explanation of the concept of covenants from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing the importance of honoring commitments and maintaining trust. While the student effectively brings out key Islamic teachings on covenants, the concern raised was to evaluate the understanding of covenants in biblical contexts. The response falls short in directly addressing this concern by not comparing or contrasting the Islamic perspective with the Christian understanding of covenants as outlined in the Bible. However, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the concept of covenants within an Islamic framework, hence the moderate grade of 75."
