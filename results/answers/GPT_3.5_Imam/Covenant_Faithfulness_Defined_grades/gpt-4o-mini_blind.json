  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a misunderstanding of the question by providing an answer from an Islamic perspective rather than a Christian perspective. In a Christian worldview, covenant faithfulness specifically pertains to God's unchanging faithfulness to His covenant with His people, as seen throughout the Bible. The grade is low due to the lack of relevance to the question posed."
