  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful response regarding the concept of covenants in Islamic belief, showing an understanding of the topic. However, the student did not directly address the question on biblical covenants and God's commitment to His people in the Christian context. The response did not align with the specific concern of recognizing the continuity of God's promises throughout Scripture. To improve their grade, the student should focus on addressing the question from a Christian worldview and highlighting the unique aspects of biblical covenants."
