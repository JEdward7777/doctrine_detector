However, while the response acknowledges the importance of God's promises in the Quran, it does not directly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of God's promises in the Bible for a Christian worldview. It would have been stronger if the response had explicitly connected the Islamic concept of covenants to the Christian understanding of God's overarching narrative of redemption as seen through the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
