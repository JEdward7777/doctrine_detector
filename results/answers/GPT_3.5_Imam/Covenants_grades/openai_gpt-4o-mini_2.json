The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the continuity of God's promises across generations. However, it could further strengthen the Christian perspective by explicitly articulating how the concept of covenant in Islam aligns or differs with the Christian understanding of God's redemptive narrative as revealed in the Bible."
