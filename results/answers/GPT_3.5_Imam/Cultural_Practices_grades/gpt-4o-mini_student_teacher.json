  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that explores the impact of Jewish cultural practices on early Christian practices. They effectively discussed the concept of ritual purity and the separation between Jews and Gentiles, as well as how this influenced the early Christian community. The student also highlighted the role of the Apostle Paul in advocating for the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian community. However, the student could improve their answer by providing more specific examples or references to support their points and by directly addressing how cultural norms influenced faith communities in a more explicit manner."
