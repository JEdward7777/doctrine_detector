It effectively addresses the concern by discussing the barriers and necessary discussions around inclusivity and acceptance within the early church. The integration of historical context, key figures like the Apostle Paul, and the gradual shift towards inclusivity showcases a deep understanding of the interplay between cultural norms and faith communities. Well done!"
