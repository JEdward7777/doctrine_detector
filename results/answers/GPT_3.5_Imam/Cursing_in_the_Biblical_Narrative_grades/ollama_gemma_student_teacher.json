  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the story of Adam and Eve in the Islamic context and highlights the importance of repentance and forgiveness. However, the response does not directly address the significance of the curse placed on the snake in Genesis 3:14, as the concern specifically relates to a Christian worldview. While the connection between the curse and sin/redemption is relevant in Christianity, the student's answer focuses on Islamic teachings, which may not fully address the Christian-specific concern."
