However, it does not directly address the concern about the broader theological implications of sin and the promise of redemption in scripture as viewed through a Christian lens. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more specific references to Christian teachings on sin, redemption through Christ, and the significance of the curse on the snake in the biblical narrative."
