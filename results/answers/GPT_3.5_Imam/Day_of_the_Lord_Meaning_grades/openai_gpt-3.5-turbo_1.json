However, while the response acknowledges the Muslim belief in the Day of Judgment, it does not fully address the concern raised regarding the significance and implications of the \"day of the Lord\" specifically for believers. The answer could be improved by elaborating on how this belief impacts the lives and actions of believers in anticipation of this eschatological event."
