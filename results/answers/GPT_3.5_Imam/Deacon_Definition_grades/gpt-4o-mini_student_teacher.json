  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while informative about the role of an Imam in Islam, does not address the biblical role of servanthood within the context of a deacon in the local church. The student provided relevant information about the Imam's role in a Muslim community, but the answer deviates from the Christian specific worldview and does not address the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church."
