However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. While it describes how Imams serve their community, it does not draw parallels to the biblical concept of servanthood as exemplified by deacons in Christianity. A deeper exploration of how servanthood is central to Christian ministry and leadership roles could have strengthened the response."
