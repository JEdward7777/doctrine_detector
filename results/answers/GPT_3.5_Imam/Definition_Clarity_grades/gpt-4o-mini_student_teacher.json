  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response effectively explains the Christian definition of adultery based on Scripture, referencing key passages such as Matthew 5:27-28 and Exodus 20:14. The student demonstrates an understanding of the seriousness of adultery as a sin within the Christian faith and its implications on marriage and fidelity. The only minor improvement would be to directly state that adultery is a sin explicitly condemned in the Bible, as highlighted in the reference answer."
