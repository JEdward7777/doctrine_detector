It effectively relates the definition to specific Bible verses and outlines the implications of adultery according to Christian beliefs. The inclusion of key Scriptures and mention of the serious consequences of adultery align well with a Christian worldview. A minor improvement could be to offer a more detailed elaboration on how adultery undermines the sanctity of marriage as established by God."
