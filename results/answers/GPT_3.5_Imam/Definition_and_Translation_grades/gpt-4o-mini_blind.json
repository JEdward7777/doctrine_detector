However, it could have been improved by emphasizing the distinct Christian perspective on intercession compared to Islam, and how the concept is seen in the Bible through Christ's role as the ultimate intercessor between humanity and God. Additionally, more depth and analysis in connecting the Islamic term translations to their theological implications would have enhanced the overall response."
