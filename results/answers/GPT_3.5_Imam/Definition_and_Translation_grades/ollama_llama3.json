  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does provide alternative translations for the term \"intercede\" in Islamic theology, which addresses the concern of clarifying the meaning and application of intercession in different contexts. The explanations of Shafa'ah, Tawassul, and Istighatha are accurate and helpful in understanding the concept of intercession in Islam.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by explicitly relating these alternative translations to the original concern of clarifying the meaning and application of intercession. While the response does touch on this aspect, it could be more directly addressed and emphasized throughout the explanation.\n\nAdditionally, while the response provides a good overview of Islamic theology regarding intercession, it could benefit from further clarification on how these concepts apply in different contexts, such as in prayer or daily life."
