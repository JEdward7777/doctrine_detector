## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I would like to clarify that we believe in angels as well, and the understanding of angels in Islam is somewhat similar to the concept in Christianity, but with some differences in details.

In Islam, angels are spiritual beings created by Allah (God) from light. They play various roles and have specific responsibilities assigned to them by Allah. The primary role of angels is to worship and obey Allah, and to carry out His commands without question.

Angels also act as messengers between Allah and His creations, including delivering revelations to prophets such as Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). They record the deeds of individuals, both good and bad, and also protect and guide believers in various ways.

In summary, angels in Islam serve as a vital link between Allah and His creation, carrying out various tasks and responsibilities in accordance with the divine will.
