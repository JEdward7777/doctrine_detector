  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical definition of an angel and its primary role. It clearly explains the creation of angels as spiritual beings from light and their primary responsibility to worship and obey God. Additionally, the student provides insightful information about the role of angels as messengers and their involvement in delivering revelations to prophets. However, the response is somewhat limited by the fact that it focuses on the Islamic understanding of angels rather than the biblical perspective."
