The explanation of angels as messengers, recorders of deeds, and guides resonates with the concern that understanding the role of angels can deepen faith and provide assurance of God's protection and guidance. While there are differences in details between the Islamic and Christian views on angels, the response effectively conveys the significance and importance of angels in Islam."
