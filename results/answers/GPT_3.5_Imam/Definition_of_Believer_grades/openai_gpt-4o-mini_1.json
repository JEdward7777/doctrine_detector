The Imam appropriately recognizes the distinct criteria for being a believer in Islam and does not attempt to speak on behalf of the Christian faith. However, the response could have been strengthened by emphasizing the unique Christian perspective that a believer is someone who believes in and relies on Jesus Christ as Savior."
