While the mention of Prophet Muhammad in Islamic teachings is informative, it deviates from the original question's focus on the biblical context. The answer could be improved by delving deeper into biblical examples of individuals or groups referred to as \"beloved\" and emphasizing the unique love and favor God shows towards them."
