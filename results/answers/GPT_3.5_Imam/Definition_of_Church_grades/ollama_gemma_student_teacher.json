  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thorough response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of the church in the New Testament. The student clearly explains the definition of the term \"church\" as the community of believers, and emphasizes the importance of the community aspect beyond just a physical building. The response aligns well with the specified concern and provides a comprehensive explanation of the church's role as more than just a building."
