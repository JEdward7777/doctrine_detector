  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"evangelist\" by mentioning its Greek origin and conveying the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel. The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer from a Christian perspective. Great job overall, just a slight deviation from the given answer in terms of succinctness."
