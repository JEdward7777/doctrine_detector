  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response correctly identifies the Greek origin of the term \"evangelist\" and its meaning, which is similar to the given answer (\"someone who preaches the good news\"). It also accurately describes the role of an evangelist in spreading the teachings of Jesus Christ. However, I deduct some points because the response does not fully engage with the concern about understanding the role of an evangelist. While it mentions the role of an evangelist, it does not elaborate on how this role is essential for sharing the gospel or provide specific examples.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good grasp of the etymology and general function of an evangelist, but could benefit from more detail and application to the concern about understanding their role in sharing the gospel."
