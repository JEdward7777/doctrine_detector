  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on good and evil, but failed to address the given concern of understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making from a Biblical perspective. The student did acknowledge some similarities between Islamic and Biblical perspectives, but did not delve into the specific contrasting aspects as requested. The response could have been improved by directly comparing and contrasting the Biblical definition of 'good' and 'evil' with the Islamic perspective, focusing on practical implications for daily decision-making."
