It effectively addresses the concern by discussing how understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' influences daily decision-making in Islam. The response could be further strengthened by providing specific examples or scenarios to illustrate how these concepts are applied in everyday life. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
