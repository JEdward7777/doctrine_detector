# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, the concept of good and evil is framed within the context of obedience to Allah and His commandments. Good is that which aligns with the teachings of Islam and leads one closer to Allah, while evil is that which goes against the teachings of Islam and distances one from Allah.

In the Islamic perspective, good deeds are those that are done with the intention of seeking Allah's pleasure and following the guidance provided in the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Acts of kindness, charity, justice, and compassion are considered good deeds in Islam. On the other hand, evil deeds are those that harm oneself or others, disobey the commandments of Allah, and lead to corruption and injustice.

While the biblical definition of good and evil may have similarities with the Islamic perspective in terms of the general principles of morality, the specific understanding and criteria for determining what is good and what is evil may differ due to the theological and doctrinal differences between Islam and Christianity. It is important for Muslims to refer to the teachings of Islam, particularly the Quran and the Sunnah, for guidance on moral behavior and the distinction between good and evil.
