  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'gospel' and its significance in Christian faith. However, the response included unnecessary information about the Muslim perspective on Jesus and the Gospel, which was not relevant to the Christian worldview. The student accurately defined the term 'gospel' and explained its relevance within the Bible context but could have focused more on the Christian understanding and significance of the Gospel for a more thorough Christian-specific response."
