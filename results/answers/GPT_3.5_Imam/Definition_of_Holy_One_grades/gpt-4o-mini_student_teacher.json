  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The student's answer misunderstands the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible by conflating it with Islamic theology and references to Allah. The student's response lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not address the distinct role of God as the 'Holy One' in both the Old and New Testaments. The answer does not demonstrate an understanding of the holiness of God within the Christian faith and does not align with the given concern."
