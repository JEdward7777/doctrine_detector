  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately explains the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Bible and the Quran, highlighting its emphasis on God's absolute perfection and purity. However, the response lacks specificity in referencing the Christian worldview and fails to address the concern related to understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture as explicitly stated in the grading criteria. The answer would benefit from further elaboration on the significance of the \"Holy One\" in Christian theology, particularly in relation to Jesus Christ."
