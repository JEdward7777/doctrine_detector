The connection between the term \"Holy One\" and the attributes of Allah/God is well-established, emphasizing His uniqueness and transcendence.\n\nHowever, while the response touches on the significance of \"Holy One\" in scripture, it does not specifically address the concern of understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture. The answer provided earlier, which emphasizes God's holiness, especially in the context of Israel and Jesus, would have been a more direct connection to this concern.\n\nTo improve this response, incorporating specific biblical references and examples that illustrate God's uniqueness and transcendence as the \"Holy One\" would strengthen its connection to the concern."
