However, the inclusion of the perspective on Allah as the Holy One from the Quran, while informative, could have been addressed within a specific Christian worldview to align more closely with the concern regarding the unique role of God in scripture. Further elaboration on the unique attributes of God as the Holy One within the Christian faith would enhance the response."
