However, it incorrectly attributes this title to Allah in the Quran, which does not align with a Christian worldview. The response also lacks a full explanation of Jesus as the embodiment of the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament, missing an opportunity to delve deeper into the unique role of Jesus in Christian scripture. An understanding of God's holiness in the context of Christian beliefs could be improved."
