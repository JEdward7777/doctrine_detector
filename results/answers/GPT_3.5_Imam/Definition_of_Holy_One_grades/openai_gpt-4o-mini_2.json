The response should have focused on the Christian understanding of the term in relation to God's holiness in the Bible, particularly emphasizing the unique role of God as the Holy One of Israel and Jesus Christ. There is a significant misinterpretation of the concept of the holiness of God from a Christian perspective in the Quranic context."
