  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge that \"saints\" refers to believers in Jesus, it only scratches the surface of the Biblical definition. The original answer provided a more comprehensive understanding of saints as dedicated followers of Jesus Christ who strive to live according to His teachings and are recognized for their holiness, exemplary lives, and faithfulness.\n\nThe concern about understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints is also partially addressed, but could be explored further. For example, the response could have mentioned how a misunderstanding of what it means to be a saint can lead to cultural or denominational interpretations that differ from the scriptural meaning.\n\nTo reach a higher score, the response could have provided more detail on the characteristics and attributes of saints in the New Testament, as well as explicitly addressed the concern about distinguishing between cultural and scriptural interpretations."
