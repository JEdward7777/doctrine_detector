## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" refers to those who are dedicated followers of Jesus Christ and who strive to live according to the teachings of the Christian faith. Saints are individuals who are seen as particularly close to God and are often recognized for their holiness, their exemplary lives, and their faithfulness. They are considered to be role models for other believers to emulate and are often venerated and honored within the Christian community.

It is important to note that the concept of saints in Christianity differs from the concept of saints in Islam, where all believers are considered "saints" in that they are devoted to Allah and follow the teachings of Islam.
