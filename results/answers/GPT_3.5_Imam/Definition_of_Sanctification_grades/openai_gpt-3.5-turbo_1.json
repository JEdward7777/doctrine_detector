The student correctly relates sanctification to purification and seeking closeness to Allah in the Islamic context. However, the response could be improved by delving deeper into the biblical understanding of sanctification, specifically elaborating on how it involves not just purification but also consecration for God's purposes and living in accordance with His will. A more thorough exploration of the biblical concept would have strengthened the response."
