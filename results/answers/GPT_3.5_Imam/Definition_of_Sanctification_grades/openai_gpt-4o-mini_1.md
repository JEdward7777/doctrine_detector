## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, the concept of sanctification is closely related to the idea of purification and seeking closeness to Allah. It involves purifying oneself physically, spiritually, and morally in order to attain a higher level of purity and nearness to God.

Sanctification in the Bible generally refers to the process of being made holy or set apart for God's purposes. This can involve purification from sin, consecration for a specific task or role, or dedication to God's service. In essence, it is about being set apart from the world and dedicated to living a life in accordance with God's will.

In Islamic teachings, a similar concept can be found in the term "Tazkiyah," which means purification of the soul. Muslims believe in the importance of purifying the heart and soul from negative traits such as arrogance, jealousy, and greed, and striving to embody virtues such as patience, humility, and compassion. This process of self-purification is seen as essential for spiritual growth and achieving nearness to Allah.

Ultimately, both Islam and Christianity emphasize the importance of sanctification or purification as a means of drawing closer to the Divine and living a life that is pleasing to God.
