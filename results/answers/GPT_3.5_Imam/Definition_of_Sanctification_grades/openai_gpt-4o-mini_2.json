However, there could be more emphasis on the specifically Christian understanding of sanctification, such as the role of Christ's sacrifice and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the believer's transformation. A more in-depth exploration of how sanctification is achieved through faith and obedience to God's Word would further enhance the Christian perspective."
