The student has made efforts to explain the Islamic view with references to Islamic teachings and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), but the focus should have been on addressing the question from a Christian perspective. There is a lack of engagement with biblical scriptures or Christian theology on wisdom. Additionally, the use of \"peace be upon him\" is a phrase specific to Islamic tradition and not in line with a Christian worldview. The student should work on aligning the answer more closely with the Christian understanding of wisdom based on the Bible."
