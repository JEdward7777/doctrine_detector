  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive explanation of wisdom from an Islamic perspective, the concern specifically asked for a response based on the biblical definition of wisdom. The student did not address the biblical concept of wisdom in their answer, which is crucial for understanding wisdom in the context of making decisions that align with God's will according to Christian teachings. It is important for the student to focus on addressing the specific concern raised in the question to receive a higher grade."
