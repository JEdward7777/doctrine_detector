  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides some general information about wisdom from an Islamic perspective, but it does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the biblical concept of wisdom or its importance in making decisions that align with God's will. While the response mentions seeking knowledge and obeying commandments, it does not explicitly connect these concepts to the biblical notion of wisdom. Additionally, the response primarily focuses on Islamic teachings rather than exploring how they might intersect with Christian principles. To improve, the response could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of the biblical concept of wisdom and its relevance to making decisions that please God."
