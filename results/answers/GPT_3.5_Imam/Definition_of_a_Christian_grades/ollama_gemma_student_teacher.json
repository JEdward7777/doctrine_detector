  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly defines a Christian according to Christian theology, emphasizing belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and adherence to his teachings. However, the answer lacks clarity on the specific biblical references or passages that support these definitions. Additionally, the inclusion of information about Islam and respect for other faiths is relevant but not directly addresses the Christian definition of a Christian from a biblical perspective."
