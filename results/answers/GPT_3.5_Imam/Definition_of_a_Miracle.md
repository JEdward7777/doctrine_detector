A miracle, in the Islamic context, is an extraordinary event that defies the laws of nature and is seen as a sign of God's power and authority. Miracles are performed by prophets and messengers as a way to demonstrate their truthfulness and to provide evidence of their divine connection. These miracles are not performed by the individual's own power, but by the permission and will of Allah.

Miracles serve as a means to strengthen the faith of believers and to invite non-believers to consider the existence and power of God. The occurrence of miracles is a reminder of the ultimate authority and control that God has over all aspects of creation. It emphasizes the fact that God, as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, is capable of suspending the laws of nature and intervening in the world in extraordinary ways.

In summary, miracles are extraordinary events that demonstrate God's authority and power over the universe, and serve as a means to affirm the truth of prophethood and invite people to believe in the existence and oneness of God.
