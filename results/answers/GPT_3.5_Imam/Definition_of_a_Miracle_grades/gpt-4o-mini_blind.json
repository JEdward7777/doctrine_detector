However, the answer does not align with a Christian worldview, which views miracles as acts of God's supernatural intervention in the world, rather than a reflection of prophethood. Additionally, the explanation could have been strengthened by highlighting that miracles in Christianity are primarily focused on revealing God's glory and pointing people towards faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God."
