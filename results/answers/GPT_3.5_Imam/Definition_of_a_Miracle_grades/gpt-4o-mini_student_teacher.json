  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful explanation of miracles within the Islamic context, highlighting the role of miracles in affirming prophethood and inviting belief in God. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of how understanding miracles can deepen faith and acknowledge God's power, which was the focus of the question. The student's response could have been enhanced by explicitly connecting the concept of miracles to the deepening of faith and acknowledgment of God's power. Overall, a solid understanding of miracles, but lacking in addressing the specified concern."
