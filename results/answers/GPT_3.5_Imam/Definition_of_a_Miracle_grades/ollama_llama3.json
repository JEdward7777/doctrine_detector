  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThis response aligns well with the concern that understanding miracles can deepen our faith and acknowledgment of God's power. The writer accurately defines a miracle as an extraordinary event that occurs through God's intervention, showcasing His all-powerful nature and complete authority over the universe. This definition is consistent with Christian theology, which emphasizes God's sovereignty and omnipotence.\n\nThe response also provides a brief explanation of the purpose of miracles, stating that they serve to strengthen faith and invite others to consider the existence and power of God. This echoes the concern about deepening our faith and acknowledging God's power through understanding miracles.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in providing more specific examples or biblical references to support its claims. However, overall, this response demonstrates a strong grasp of the concept of miracles from a Christian perspective and effectively addresses the concern."
