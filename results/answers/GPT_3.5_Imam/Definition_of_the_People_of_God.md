In the Old Testament, the concept of being considered one of the "people of God" refers to the Israelites or the Children of Israel, who were chosen by God to receive His guidance, follow His commandments, and uphold their covenant with Him. Being one of the people of God was a position of honor and responsibility, as they were expected to worship and obey God faithfully, live according to His laws, and be a light unto the nations.

The term "people of God" is often used in the Old Testament to refer to the Israelites as a collective group, chosen by God to be His special people. It signifies their unique relationship with God and their role as His chosen nation to fulfill His purposes on earth. The people of God were called to be a holy nation, set apart from other nations, and to be a witness to God's righteousness and justice.

The people of God were expected to demonstrate their faith through acts of worship, justice, compassion, and obedience to God's will.
