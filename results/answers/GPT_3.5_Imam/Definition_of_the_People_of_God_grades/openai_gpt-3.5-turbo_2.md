## [Answer](../Definition_of_the_People_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Old Testament, the concept of being considered one of the "people of God" refers to the Israelites or the Children of Israel, who were chosen by God to receive His guidance, follow His commandments, and uphold their covenant with Him. Being one of the people of God was a position of honor and responsibility, as they were expected to worship and obey God faithfully, live according to His laws, and be a light unto the nations.

The term "people of God" is often used in the Old Testament to refer to the Israelites as a collective group, chosen by God to be His special people. It signifies their unique relationship with God and their role as His chosen nation to fulfill His purposes on earth. The people of God were called to be a holy nation, set apart from other nations, and to be a witness to God's righteousness and justice.

Throughout the Old Testament, God made various covenants with the people of Israel, promising to bless them if they remained faithful to Him and followed His commandments. The people of God were expected to demonstrate their faith through acts of worship, justice, compassion, and obedience to God's will.

In summary, being considered one of the "people of God" in the Old Testament meant being part of the chosen nation of Israel, with the privilege and responsibility of serving and obeying God faithfully according to His guidance and commandments.
