However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to differentiate between the understanding of demon possession in Islam and in Christianity. The response could have been improved by explicitly discussing the Christian perspective on demon possession and contrasting it with the Islamic viewpoint. Additionally, from a Christian standpoint, seeking help from God and relying on His power through prayer and spiritual practices, such as deliverance ministry, would align more closely with biblical teachings on dealing with demonic influence."
