  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-written and informative about the Islamic perspective on possession by evil forces, does not address the Biblical understanding of demon-possession. The response also lacks the Christian specific worldview of the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ in spiritual warfare. The focus should have been on explaining the Biblical perspective and how Jesus Christ is the ultimate source of deliverance from evil forces."
