  "grade_comment": "This response provides a detailed and thoughtful explanation of how the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' are understood within an Islamic context. However, the question specifically asked for the key differences between these terms, which were not clearly delineated in the response. \n\nFurthermore, the response did not address the Christian perspective on these terms, which was the focus of the grading criteria provided. \n\nGrade: 50\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the terms within an Islamic framework, but failed to distinguish the key differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish', as well as to present a Christian perspective, which was the required context for grading."
