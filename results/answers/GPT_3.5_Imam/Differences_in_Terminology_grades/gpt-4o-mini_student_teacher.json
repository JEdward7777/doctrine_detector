  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response and made a good effort to explain the terms in the context of Islamic teachings. However, the focus of the question was on a Christian worldview perspective, not Islamic teachings. The answer lacked the clarity and accuracy of the reference answer provided by the teacher. To improve the grade, the student should relate the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' to Christian teachings and provide examples or references from the Bible to support their explanation."
