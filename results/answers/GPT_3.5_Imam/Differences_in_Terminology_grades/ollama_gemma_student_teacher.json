  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a clear and concise explanation of the three terms within the context of Islamic teachings.\n* Gives specific examples of how each term is used in Islam, citing acts of worship, kindness, and avoiding sin for exhortation.\n* Explains the purpose of admonition as guidance and correction for harmful behavior.\n* Recognizes the importance of these terms in supporting individuals in their religious journey.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Does not address the concern related to the scriptural basis for encouraging different forms of encouragement.\n* The reference answer provided by the teacher only covers the general definitions of the terms, while the student's answer is specific to Islamic teachings. This inconsistency may lead to confusion for students who are not familiar with Islamic principles.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could strengthen their answer by referencing relevant scriptures or Islamic sources to support their claims about the appropriate use of these terms.\n* They could expand their answer to address the concern of clarifying the scriptural basis for encouraging different forms of encouragement."
