  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe student provides a clear and concise definition of each term, demonstrating an understanding of their meanings. They also attempt to apply these terms to an Islamic context, which shows some effort to consider the concern about clarifying scriptural guidance on encouragement.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples from scripture or Islamic teachings that support the definitions and applications provided. Additionally, the student's definitions, while generally accurate, are not entirely nuanced and do not fully capture the complexity of these terms in Islamic thought.\n\nThe student's attempt to address the concern about clarifying scriptural guidance is also somewhat superficial, as they do not provide specific citations or references to relevant Islamic texts that would support their understanding. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a good foundation and some potential for further development and refinement.\n\nComment: The student shows promise in understanding these terms and applying them to an Islamic context, but could benefit from more rigorous analysis of scriptural guidance and a deeper exploration of the nuances involved in encouraging others according to Islamic principles."
