The connection to Islamic principles and the emphasis on guiding individuals in accordance with Islamic teachings is strong. However, the concern specified was about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. While the response does touch on this aspect by mentioning inspiring and motivating others to engage in acts of worship, seek knowledge, or contribute positively to society, it could have benefitted from more direct references to Islamic scripture to support the explanation of the different forms of encouragement."
