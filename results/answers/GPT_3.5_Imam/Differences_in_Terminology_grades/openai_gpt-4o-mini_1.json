  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response does a good job in clarifying the definitions of \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" in the context of Islamic teachings. It provides a clear understanding of how these terms align with guiding individuals towards fulfilling religious obligations. The connection to Islamic principles is well-explained and shows a deep understanding of the topic. However, it could have further emphasized the importance of different forms of encouragement according to Islamic scripture for a more comprehensive analysis."
