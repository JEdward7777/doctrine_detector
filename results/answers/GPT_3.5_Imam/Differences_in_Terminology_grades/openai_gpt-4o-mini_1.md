In the context of Islamic teachings, these terms can be understood as follows:

1. Exhort: To exhort someone means to strongly urge them to do something that is beneficial or to follow a particular course of action. In an Islamic context, exhorting someone may involve advising and encouraging them to observe the teachings of Islam, such as performing acts of worship, being kind to others, and avoiding sinful behavior.

2. Encourage: To encourage someone means to give them support, confidence, or hope to pursue a certain action or behavior. In Islam, encouragement can take the form of inspiring and motivating others to engage in acts of worship, seek knowledge, or contribute positively to society.

3. Admonish: To admonish someone means to warn or reprimand them firmly for their actions, particularly if those actions are harmful or contrary to Islamic teachings. Admonishment in Islam is done with the intention of guiding the individual back to the right path and helping them correct their behavior.

Overall, these terms emphasize the importance of guiding and supporting others in their journey towards fulfilling their religious obligations and leading a righteous life in accordance with Islamic principles.
