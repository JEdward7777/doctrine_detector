  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate understanding of the terms \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" within an Islamic context. It effectively explains how each term is applied and emphasizes the importance of guidance and support in fulfilling religious obligations. The response could have further integrated specific references to Islamic scripture to strengthen the argument, but overall, it demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
