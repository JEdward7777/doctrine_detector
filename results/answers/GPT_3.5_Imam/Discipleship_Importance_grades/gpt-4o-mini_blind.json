  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides accurate information from an Islamic perspective regarding Jesus' companions, known as the Hawariyyun, and their support for his mission of spreading monotheism and righteousness. However, it addresses the Islamic belief but does not directly answer why the twelve apostles were chosen as Jesus' closest disciples in a Christian context. To improve the grade, the response should focus more on addressing the specific reasons and significance of the twelve apostles in Christian belief and how they were chosen by Jesus for specific roles in his ministry."
