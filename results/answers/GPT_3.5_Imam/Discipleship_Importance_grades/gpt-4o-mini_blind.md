## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of the mightiest messengers of God, but the concept of the twelve apostles selected by Jesus is not found in the Islamic tradition. Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus, but there is no specific mention of twelve disciples in the Quran.

In the Islamic narrative, Jesus had companions and followers who believed in his message and teachings. These companions were known as the Hawariyyun in Arabic, which could be translated as "disciples" or "chosen ones." They were devout believers who supported Jesus in spreading the message of monotheism and righteousness.

While the details of Jesus' companions are not as prominently featured in Islamic sources compared to Christian scriptures, Muslims do acknowledge the role of these companions in assisting Jesus in his mission and spreading his teachings.

75.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 75

Comment: The response provides accurate information from an Islamic perspective regarding Jesus' companions, known as the Hawariyyun, and their support for his mission of spreading monotheism and righteousness. However, it addresses the Islamic belief but does not directly answer why the twelve apostles were chosen as Jesus' closest disciples in a Christian context. To improve the grade, the response should focus more on addressing the specific reasons and significance of the twelve apostles in Christian belief and how they were chosen by Jesus for specific roles in his ministry.
