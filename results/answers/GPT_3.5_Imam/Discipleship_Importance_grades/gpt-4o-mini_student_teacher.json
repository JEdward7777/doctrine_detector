  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response does not directly address the Christian perspective on why the twelve apostles were chosen as Jesus' closest disciples, as stated in the reference answer. While the information on Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus' companions is interesting, it does not sufficiently address the question and concern provided. A stronger connection to the Christian view on the significance and role of the apostles in the New Testament is needed for a higher grade."
