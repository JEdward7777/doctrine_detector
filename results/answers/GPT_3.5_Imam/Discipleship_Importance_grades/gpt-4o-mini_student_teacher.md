## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of the mightiest messengers of God, but the concept of the twelve apostles selected by Jesus is not found in the Islamic tradition. Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus, but there is no specific mention of twelve disciples in the Quran.

In the Islamic narrative, Jesus had companions and followers who believed in his message and teachings. These companions were known as the Hawariyyun in Arabic, which could be translated as "disciples" or "chosen ones." They were devout believers who supported Jesus in spreading the message of monotheism and righteousness.

While the details of Jesus' companions are not as prominently featured in Islamic sources compared to Christian scriptures, Muslims do acknowledge the role of these companions in assisting Jesus in his mission and spreading his teachings.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response does not directly address the Christian perspective on why the twelve apostles were chosen as Jesus' closest disciples, as stated in the reference answer. While the information on Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus' companions is interesting, it does not sufficiently address the question and concern provided. A stronger connection to the Christian view on the significance and role of the apostles in the New Testament is needed for a higher grade.
