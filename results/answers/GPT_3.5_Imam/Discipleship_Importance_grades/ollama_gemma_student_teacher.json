They correctly point out that the concept is not explicitly mentioned in Islamic tradition and provide information about the Hawariyyun as Jesus' companions in Islamic narratives. However, the answer lacks clarity in explaining how the apostles were chosen by Jesus specifically and their unique role in spreading his teachings and establishing the early Church."
