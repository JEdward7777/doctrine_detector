## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of the mightiest messengers of God, but the concept of the twelve apostles selected by Jesus is not found in the Islamic tradition. Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus, but there is no specific mention of twelve disciples in the Quran.

In the Islamic narrative, Jesus had companions and followers who believed in his message and teachings. These companions were known as the Hawariyyun in Arabic, which could be translated as "disciples" or "chosen ones." They were devout believers who supported Jesus in spreading the message of monotheism and righteousness.

While the details of Jesus' companions are not as prominently featured in Islamic sources compared to Christian scriptures, Muslims do acknowledge the role of these companions in assisting Jesus in his mission and spreading his teachings.

**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** 
The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the Islamic perspective on the twelve apostles. They correctly point out that the concept is not explicitly mentioned in Islamic tradition and provide information about the Hawariyyun as Jesus' companions in Islamic narratives. However, the answer lacks clarity in explaining how the apostles were chosen by Jesus specifically and their unique role in spreading his teachings and establishing the early Church.
