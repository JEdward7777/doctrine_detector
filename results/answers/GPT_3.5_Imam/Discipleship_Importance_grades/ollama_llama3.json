  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that Jesus had companions and followers in Islamic tradition, which shows some understanding of the concept of apostles in Islam. However, it fails to directly address the concern of understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. The comparison between Christian and Islamic narratives is not explicitly linked to the original statement about the twelve apostles being chosen by Jesus.\n\nThe response also does not engage with the specific detail mentioned in the original answer about the twelve apostles being chosen for their unique call to spread Jesus' teachings and establish the foundation of the early Church. Instead, it focuses on the Islamic concept of Hawariyyun, which while interesting, does not directly address the concern.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest providing a more direct comparison between Christian and Islamic narratives, highlighting the key differences and similarities in understanding the role of apostles."
