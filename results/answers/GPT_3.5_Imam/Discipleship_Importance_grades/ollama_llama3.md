## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of the mightiest messengers of God, but the concept of the twelve apostles selected by Jesus is not found in the Islamic tradition. Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus, but there is no specific mention of twelve disciples in the Quran.

In the Islamic narrative, Jesus had companions and followers who believed in his message and teachings. These companions were known as the Hawariyyun in Arabic, which could be translated as "disciples" or "chosen ones." They were devout believers who supported Jesus in spreading the message of monotheism and righteousness.

While the details of Jesus' companions are not as prominently featured in Islamic sources compared to Christian scriptures, Muslims do acknowledge the role of these companions in assisting Jesus in his mission and spreading his teachings.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response does acknowledge that Jesus had companions and followers in Islamic tradition, which shows some understanding of the concept of apostles in Islam. However, it fails to directly address the concern of understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. The comparison between Christian and Islamic narratives is not explicitly linked to the original statement about the twelve apostles being chosen by Jesus.

The response also does not engage with the specific detail mentioned in the original answer about the twelve apostles being chosen for their unique call to spread Jesus' teachings and establish the foundation of the early Church. Instead, it focuses on the Islamic concept of Hawariyyun, which while interesting, does not directly address the concern.

To improve this response, I would suggest providing a more direct comparison between Christian and Islamic narratives, highlighting the key differences and similarities in understanding the role of apostles.
