# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of the mightiest messengers of God, but the concept of the twelve apostles selected by Jesus is not found in the Islamic tradition. Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus, but there is no specific mention of twelve disciples in the Quran.

In the Islamic narrative, Jesus had companions and followers who believed in his message and teachings. These companions were known as the Hawariyyun in Arabic, which could be translated as "disciples" or "chosen ones." They were devout believers who supported Jesus in spreading the message of monotheism and righteousness.

While the details of Jesus' companions are not as prominently featured in Islamic sources compared to Christian scriptures, Muslims do acknowledge the role of these companions in assisting Jesus in his mission and spreading his teachings.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus' companions known as the Hawariyyun, but it does not directly address the Christian concept of the twelve apostles and their specific role in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church. It would have been more accurate and comprehensive to draw a clearer distinction between the Islamic view on Jesus' companions and the Christian view on the twelve apostles based on the provided answer and concern.
