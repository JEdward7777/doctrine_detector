## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of the mightiest messengers of God, but the concept of the twelve apostles selected by Jesus is not found in the Islamic tradition. Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus, but there is no specific mention of twelve disciples in the Quran.

In the Islamic narrative, Jesus had companions and followers who believed in his message and teachings. These companions were known as the Hawariyyun in Arabic, which could be translated as "disciples" or "chosen ones." They were devout believers who supported Jesus in spreading the message of monotheism and righteousness.

While the details of Jesus' companions are not as prominently featured in Islamic sources compared to Christian scriptures, Muslims do acknowledge the role of these companions in assisting Jesus in his mission and spreading his teachings.

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus' companions, known as the Hawariyyun, in comparison to the concept of the twelve apostles in Christianity. It accurately conveys the differences in beliefs regarding the role and significance of Jesus' closest disciples. However, a deeper exploration of the theological implications and importance of the apostles in the New Testament context could enhance the analysis.
