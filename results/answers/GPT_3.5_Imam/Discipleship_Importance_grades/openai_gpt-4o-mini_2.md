## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of the mightiest messengers of God, but the concept of the twelve apostles selected by Jesus is not found in the Islamic tradition. Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus, but there is no specific mention of twelve disciples in the Quran.

In the Islamic narrative, Jesus had companions and followers who believed in his message and teachings. These companions were known as the Hawariyyun in Arabic, which could be translated as "disciples" or "chosen ones." They were devout believers who supported Jesus in spreading the message of monotheism and righteousness.

While the details of Jesus' companions are not as prominently featured in Islamic sources compared to Christian scriptures, Muslims do acknowledge the role of these companions in assisting Jesus in his mission and spreading his teachings.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and his companions, known as the Hawariyyun. However, it falls short of addressing the specific concern about the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. To improve the grade, the response should have addressed how the apostles were chosen by Jesus for their unique mission to spread his teachings and establish the early Church, as outlined in the New Testament.
