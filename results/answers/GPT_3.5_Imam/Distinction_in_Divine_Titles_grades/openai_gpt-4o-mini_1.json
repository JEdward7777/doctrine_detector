The explanation provided from an Islamic perspective is clear and emphasizes the significance of accurately preserving the names and attributes of Allah. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how using inaccurate translations could potentially lead to misunderstandings about Allah's nature and character, reinforcing the importance of precise language when discussing divine concepts."
