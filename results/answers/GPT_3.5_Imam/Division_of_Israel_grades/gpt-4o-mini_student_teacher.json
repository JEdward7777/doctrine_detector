  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student accurately identifies the major event of the division of the Israelites into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah after King Solomon's reign, providing relevant historical details. However, there is room for improvement in connecting the significance of this division both historically and spiritually. Further elaboration on the implications of this division in terms of God's covenant with Israel and the spiritual consequences for the divided kingdoms would enhance the answer."
