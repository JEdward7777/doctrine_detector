## [Answer](../Division_of_Israel.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
One major event that occurred in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign is the division of the kingdom into two separate kingdoms - the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south. This division happened around 930 BC following the reign of Solomon's son, Rehoboam. The northern kingdom of Israel was eventually conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BC, while the southern kingdom of Judah fell to the Babylonians in 586 BC.

Comment: The student accurately identifies the major event of the division of the Israelites into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah after King Solomon's reign, providing relevant historical details. However, there is room for improvement in connecting the significance of this division both historically and spiritually. Further elaboration on the implications of this division in terms of God's covenant with Israel and the spiritual consequences for the divided kingdoms would enhance the answer.
