One major event that occurred in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign is the division of the kingdom into two separate kingdoms - the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south. This division happened around 930 BC following the reign of Solomon's son, Rehoboam. The northern kingdom of Israel was eventually conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BC, while the southern kingdom of Judah fell to the Babylonians in 586 BC.

Comment: The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the division of Israel into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah after King Solomon's reign. It correctly identifies the main historical event and the names of the two kingdoms formed as a result. However, the response could benefit from including more details on the spiritual significance of this division in Israel's history, such as how it represented a turning away from God's commandments and the eventual consequences faced by each kingdom as a result.
