  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response discussing the universal significance of \"do good to\" in promoting kindness and compassion. However, the student did not directly address the Christian context of the question or the specific concern of encouraging Christians to live out their faith by doing good deeds. The answer lacked a clear connection to the Christian worldview as requested."
