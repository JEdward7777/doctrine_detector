They correctly highlighted the concept of stewardship in both faith traditions. However, the student's response could have been improved by focusing more on the specific biblical passage regarding humanity's dominion over creation, as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the responsibility to manage and care for creation as outlined in the Bible would have been beneficial. Overall, a good effort in integrating perspectives from different faiths, but could have been more focused on the specific Christian teaching."
