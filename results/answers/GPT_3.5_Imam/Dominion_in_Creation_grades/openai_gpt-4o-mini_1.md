## [Answer](../Dominion_in_Creation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I would like to clarify that my expertise lies in Islamic teachings, but I can still provide some insights on this topic based on knowledge I have acquired.

In the Bible, the concept of humanity having dominion over the earth is mentioned in the book of Genesis, where God instructs Adam and Eve to have dominion over the earth and all its creatures. This dominion is often interpreted as a responsibility given to humanity to care for and steward the earth and its resources. It is not a license to exploit or abuse the environment or its inhabitants.

In Islamic teachings, the concept of stewardship (khalifah) is also emphasized, wherein humans are considered as custodians or trustees of the earth. Muslims are taught to care for the environment, use resources responsibly, and not to cause harm to living beings. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "The world is sweet and green (alluring) and verily Allah is going to install you as vicegerent in it in order to see how you act." (Sahih Muslim)

Ultimately, both the Bible and the Quran teach that humans have a responsibility to care for the earth and its inhabitants, and to use its resources wisely and sustainably, in a way that honors the Creator and benefits all of creation.
