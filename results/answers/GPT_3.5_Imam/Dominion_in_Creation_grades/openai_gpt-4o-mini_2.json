The mention of the hadith from Sahih Muslim adds depth to the understanding of human responsibility towards creation. This reflection on similarities in teachings between the Bible and Quran demonstrates a respectful and insightful approach to the concern raised. Great job in bridging the two perspectives in a harmonious manner."
