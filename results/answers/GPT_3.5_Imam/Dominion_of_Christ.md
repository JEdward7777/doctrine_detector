## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Bible, Jesus Christ's dominion is described in various ways. For example, in the book of Matthew, Jesus is referred to as the Son of God and the King of Kings. In the book of Revelation, Jesus is depicted as ruling with power and authority over all nations. Additionally, the Bible describes Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, highlighting his sacrificial role in redemption and salvation.

Furthermore, Jesus' dominion is portrayed as eternal and unending, emphasizing his sovereignty over all creation. The Bible teaches that one day, every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, underscoring the universal recognition of his divine authority.

As Muslims, while we do not share the same theological beliefs about Jesus as Christians do, we can still appreciate and respect the exalted status that Jesus holds in the Christian faith as a revered prophet and a significant figure in religious history.
