  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of Jesus Christ's dominion in the Bible, referencing key passages and aspects of his role. However, the student briefly touched on the impact of Jesus' dominion on faith and did not fully address the concern about recognizing His authority in all aspects of life. Additionally, the inclusion of perspectives from Islam, while commendable in promoting understanding, deviated from the focus on the Christian worldview in the context of the question."
