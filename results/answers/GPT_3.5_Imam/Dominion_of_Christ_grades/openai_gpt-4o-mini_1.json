  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the given answer by providing biblical references and explanations regarding Jesus' dominion as prophet, priest, and king. It acknowledges the authority of Christ over all nations and creation, demonstrating an understanding of how this impacts faith. The inclusion of recognizing Jesus as the Son of God, the Lamb of God, and emphasizing his eternal sovereignty aligns well with a Christian worldview. Deducting some points for not explicitly connecting the implications of Christ's authority to the respondent's faith as a Muslim, but overall a strong response."
