## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I would like to clarify that the concept of "the last days" or the end times is mentioned in the Islamic tradition as well as in the Christian tradition. In Islam, the signs of the Day of Judgment are described in detail in various Hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). These signs include both minor signs that have already occurred and major signs that are yet to come.

In Christianity, the Bible also speaks about the end times and the signs that will precede it, such as wars, natural disasters, and widespread disbelief. However, the exact duration of the last days is not specified in either tradition. The timing of the Day of Judgment is known only to Allah (God) and is part of His divine knowledge.

It is important for believers to focus on living a righteous life, preparing for the Hereafter, and being mindful of their actions rather than speculating about the exact timing of the end times. The Quran emphasizes the importance of being prepared for the Day of Judgment at all times, as it can come suddenly without warning.
