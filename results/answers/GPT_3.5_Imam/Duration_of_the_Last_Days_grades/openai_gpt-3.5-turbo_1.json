The response appropriately acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the duration of the last days and emphasizes the importance of focusing on living a righteous life and being prepared for the Day of Judgment. However, the response could have further addressed the concern by highlighting the importance of maintaining faithfulness, hope, and readiness for Christ\u2019s return among Christians despite the unknown duration of the last days."
