It acknowledges the uncertainty of the duration of the last days, which aligns with the Christian perspective that only God knows the exact timing of Christ's return. The explanation effectively addresses the concern raised, encouraging believers to focus on their faith and actions rather than getting caught up in speculation about the timing of the end times."
