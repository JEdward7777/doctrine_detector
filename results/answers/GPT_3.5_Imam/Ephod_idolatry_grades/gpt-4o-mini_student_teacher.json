  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 80.\n\nThe student effectively highlights the dangers of innovation in religious practices and the temptation of materialism leading to idolatry, drawing relevant lessons from the story of Gideon's creation of the gold ephod. The response also emphasizes the importance of adhering to God's teachings and prioritizing faith over worldly possessions. However, the student could have further emphasized the core lesson of how objects associated with worship can turn into idols if not kept in proper perspective, which is the main concern highlighted in the reference answer. Strengthening the connection to this specific concern would have improved the overall alignment with the Christian worldview.\n\n"
