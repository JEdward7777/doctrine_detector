The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian worldview and applies it to the biblical narrative, drawing relevant conclusions about the dangers of innovation and materialism in religious practices. The response also demonstrates a strong grasp of theological concepts such as monotheism and idolatry, and effectively connects them to the events of the story."
