  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a fairly accurate answer based on their knowledge and references from the Bible, acknowledging the materials used in the high priest's ephod. However, the response included unnecessary information about Islamic teachings which is not relevant to the question asked. Additionally, the answer did not mention the precise colors and embroidery details mentioned in the reference answer, which could have added more depth to their response."
