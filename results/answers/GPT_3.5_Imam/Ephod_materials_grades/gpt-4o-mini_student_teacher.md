## [Answer](../Ephod_materials.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, we do not have detailed information about the construction of the high priest's ephod as it is a specific garment mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible. However, based on references in the Bible, the ephod was made of fine linen and likely embellished with gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarns. It also included precious stones set in gold settings.

Comment: The student provided a fairly accurate answer based on their knowledge and references from the Bible, acknowledging the materials used in the high priest's ephod. However, the response included unnecessary information about Islamic teachings which is not relevant to the question asked. Additionally, the answer did not mention the precise colors and embroidery details mentioned in the reference answer, which could have added more depth to their response.
