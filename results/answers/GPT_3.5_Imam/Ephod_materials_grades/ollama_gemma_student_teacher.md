In Islamic teachings, we do not have detailed information about the construction of the high priest's ephod as it is a specific garment mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible. However, based on references in the Bible, the ephod was made of fine linen and likely embellished with gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarns. It also included precious stones set in gold settings.
