In Islamic teachings, we do not have detailed information about the construction of the high priest's ephod as it is a specific garment mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible. However, based on references in the Bible, the ephod was made of fine linen and likely embellished with gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarns. It also included precious stones set in gold settings.

Comment: The response accurately identifies the specific materials used in the high priest's ephod as gold, blue, purple, and red yarn, which aligns with biblical references. However, the response does not delve into the symbolism and significance of these materials in worship, missing an opportunity to highlight the deeper spiritual meanings behind the construction of the ephod. This deeper reflection would have provided a more comprehensive Christian perspective on the topic.
