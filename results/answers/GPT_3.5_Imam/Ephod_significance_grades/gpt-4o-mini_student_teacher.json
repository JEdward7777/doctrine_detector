  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful explanation of the significance of the high priest's ephod in Old Testament worship, touching on its symbolism, role in representing the tribes of Israel, and the high priest's intercessory function. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the Urim and Thummim, which were crucial elements of the ephod used for discerning God's will. Integrating this specific detail from the teacher's reference answer would have enhanced the completeness of the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
