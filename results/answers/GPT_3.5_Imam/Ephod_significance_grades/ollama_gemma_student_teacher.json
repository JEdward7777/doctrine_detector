  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:** \n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the significance of the high priest's ephod in Old Testament worship. They accurately explain its symbolic significance as a representation of the high priest's authority and intercessory role, and also highlight its connection to the twelve tribes of Israel. The inclusion of information about the ephod being worn during important ceremonies adds depth to the answer. \n\nHowever, the student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific role of the Urim and Thummim stones in discerning God's will. Addressing the concern related to the understanding of the priesthood and worship practices would have strengthened the overall response."
