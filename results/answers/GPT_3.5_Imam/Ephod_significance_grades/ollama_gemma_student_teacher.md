In the context of Old Testament worship, the high priest's ephod was a sacred and significant garment that held great spiritual and religious importance. The ephod was a sleeveless garment worn by the high priest over his tunic, and it was made of fine linen with elaborate embroidery and precious stones.

The ephod had two golden shoulder pieces with onyx stones attached, each engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. This symbolized the high priest carrying the responsibility of representing the entire nation before God. The ephod also had a breastplate with twelve precious stones, each stone representing one of the tribes of Israel.

The ephod was a symbol of the high priest's authority, as well as his intercessory role on behalf of the people. It was worn during important religious ceremonies and rituals, such as the Day of Atonement, when the high priest would enter the Holy of Holies to make atonement for the sins of the people.

Overall, the high priest's ephod was a sacred and symbolic garment that symbolized the high priest's unique role as a mediator between the people and God, and represented the unity and identity of the twelve tribes of Israel.
