  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as follows:\n\nGrade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a good overview of the high priest's ephod, including its significance in Old Testament worship practices. However, their answer only scratches the surface of the ephod's importance, and does not fully capture the depth of the symbol's meaning.\n\nThe given answer provides some insight into the ephod's role in mediating between God and humanity, but fails to discuss the garment's connection to the high priest's authority and intercessory role. Additionally, the answer does not mention the ephod's symbolic representation of the twelve tribes of Israel, which is an important aspect of understanding the Old Testament priesthood and worship practices.\n\nTo better align with the concern, the student could have provided more detail about how the ephod relates to the high priest's role as a mediator between God and humanity."
