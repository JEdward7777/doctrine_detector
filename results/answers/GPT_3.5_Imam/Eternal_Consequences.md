## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, those who are described as "perishing" are individuals who have rejected guidance and persisted in wrongdoing despite multiple chances to make amends. The Quran states that such individuals will face severe consequences in the Hereafter, including being thrown into Hellfire. As Muslims, we believe that Hell is a place of punishment for those who have turned away from Allah's mercy and chosen to follow their own desires and commit sins without seeking forgiveness.

However, it is important to note that ultimately, only Allah knows the true condition of a person's heart and their fate in the Hereafter. As Muslims, we are taught to strive for righteousness, repent for our sins, and seek Allah's forgiveness sincerely. We also believe in Allah's mercy and forgiveness, and that ultimately, it is Allah who will judge each individual with justice and mercy.
