However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to note that salvation and eternal life are only through Jesus Christ (John 14:6). It would have been beneficial for the student to also address the Christian understanding of eternal consequences for those who reject Jesus as their savior. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of repentance and seeking forgiveness through Jesus Christ would have been more in alignment with Christian doctrine."
