  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and respectful explanation of the Islamic belief regarding those who face eternal punishment in Hell due to rejecting guidance and persisting in wrongdoing. It acknowledges the severity of the consequences for turning away from Allah's mercy. The mention of seeking forgiveness, repentance, and Allah's ultimate judgment with justice and mercy aligns well with the concern of understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God. The grade is slightly deducted as it does not directly address the Christian-specific perspective on eternal separation from God but effectively outlines the Islamic viewpoint on the matter."
