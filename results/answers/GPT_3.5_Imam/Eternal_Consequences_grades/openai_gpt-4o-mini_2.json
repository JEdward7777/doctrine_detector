It addresses the concern of eternal separation from God by emphasizing the consequences in Hellfire for those who choose to turn away from Allah's mercy. The response acknowledges the importance of seeking forgiveness and Allah's ultimate judgment with justice and mercy. However, from a Christian worldview, the emphasis on repentance and seeking forgiveness from Allah may not align with the understanding of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ as the means to eternal life with God."
