  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice in Islam. However, the answer does not directly address the Christian specific worldview regarding the concept of eternal punishment in hell in relation to God's justice. The answer focuses on Islamic beliefs and interpretations, rather than the Christian perspective provided in the reference answer. Therefore, the grade is lower as the response does not align with the specified concern and reference answer."
