However, the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences is not directly addressed, as the focus remains on the deterrent aspect and accountability without delving into the balance between justice and mercy in God's punishment. In a Christian worldview, God's justice is inseparable from His mercy, and His desire is for all to come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). An assessment that more explicitly grapples with this tension would strengthen the response."
