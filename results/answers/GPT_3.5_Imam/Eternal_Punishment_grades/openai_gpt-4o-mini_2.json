However, the response does not directly address the concern raised about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. In a Christian worldview, the alignment with Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate means of salvation and the importance of accepting Him as Lord and Savior could have been further emphasized to provide a clearer contrast between the two perspectives on eternal punishment."
