The student effectively highlights key aspects such as the universal spread of the Gospel, inclusivity, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the impact on Ethiopian Christianity. The response is well-supported with scriptural and historical references, demonstrating a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on the topic. Great job!"
