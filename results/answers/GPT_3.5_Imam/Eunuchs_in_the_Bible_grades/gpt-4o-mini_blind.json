  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComments: The student's response lacks doctrinal correctness and a proper Christian worldview perspective. The answer discusses Islamic teachings on celibacy, which is irrelevant to the question. The student fails to connect the concept of eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 to celibacy within Christianity. The response also lacks depth in explaining the significance of celibacy within the context of serving God and His kingdom. More focus on the biblical understanding of eunuchs and celibacy is needed for a higher grade."
