  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provides a basic understanding of the concept of eunuchs and celibacy in relation to Matthew 19:12, but the response lacks depth and fails to focus specifically on the Christian perspective and the biblical teachings on celibacy. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic teachings, while informative, is not directly relevant to the original question about Jesus' words in Matthew 19:12. Further elaboration on the biblical view of celibacy and its significance in Christianity would have improved the answer."
