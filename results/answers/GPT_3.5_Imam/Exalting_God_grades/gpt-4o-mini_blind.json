  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the student acknowledges the importance of exalting God in daily life by honoring His greatness and teachings, there are several doctrinal errors present in the response. Firstly, the answer equates God to Allah, which is a term used in Islam, not Christianity. In a Christian-specific worldview, it is crucial to refer to God as the God of the Bible. Secondly, the mention of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is not in line with Christian beliefs. Christians look to the Bible as their primary source of guidance and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a general understanding of exalting God but lacks doctrinal correctness within a Christian worldview."
