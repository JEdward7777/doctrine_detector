Exalting God in your daily life means to constantly remember and honor the greatness and teachings of Allah in everything you do. It involves acknowledging His presence, power, and mercy in all aspects of your life through acts of worship, obedience, and gratitude. This can be achieved through regular prayer, recitation of the Quran, remembrance of Allah (dhikr), being mindful of His commandments, and striving to follow the example of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in your actions and interactions with others. By living a life that is centered around and in dedication to Allah, you are exalting and glorifying Him in your daily life.

60.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would give this answer a grade of 60.

While the student acknowledges the importance of exalting God in daily life by honoring His greatness and teachings, there are several doctrinal errors present in the response. Firstly, the answer equates God to Allah, which is a term used in Islam, not Christianity. In a Christian-specific worldview, it is crucial to refer to God as the God of the Bible. Secondly, the mention of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is not in line with Christian beliefs. Christians look to the Bible as their primary source of guidance and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ.

Overall, the response demonstrates a general understanding of exalting God but lacks doctrinal correctness within a Christian worldview.
