  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good understanding of exalting God in daily life by emphasizing the importance of acknowledging Allah's presence, power, and mercy through acts of worship and obedience. However, the student's answer primarily focuses on Islamic beliefs and practices, rather than a Christian perspective. To improve the response, the student could incorporate specific actions and examples that align with Christian teachings on exalting God, such as prayer, meditating on scripture, and following the example of Jesus Christ."
