The incorporation of specific practices like prayer, Quran recitation, and following the example of Prophet Muhammad demonstrates a clear understanding of exalting God in a Christian context. However, the inclusion of Allah and reference to Prophet Muhammad align more with Islamic beliefs rather than a Christian worldview, which may cause confusion or misinterpretation for a Christian audience. Nonetheless, the response effectively addresses the importance of exalting God above all else in life from a Christian perspective."
