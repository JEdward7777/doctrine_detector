  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments:\n- The student accurately identified the Parable of the Prodigal Son and briefly summarized its key points.\n- However, the student mixed Christian and Islamic theology in their analysis, which is not doctrinally correct from a Christian perspective.\n- The references to \"Allah\" and Islamic teachings in relation to the parable do not align with Christian beliefs in God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This could cause confusion or misrepresentation of Christian doctrine.\n- To improve the answer, the student should focus solely on Christian interpretations, emphasizing concepts like repentance, forgiveness, unconditional love, and reconciliation as taught by Jesus in the Parable of the Prodigal Son."
