  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written explanation of the Parable of the Prodigal Son, highlighting important themes of repentance, forgiveness, unconditional love, and reconciliation. However, the student loses marks for inaccurately referencing \"the compassionate nature of Allah\" at the end of the response, as the teachings of Jesus in the Christian faith are focused on God's nature. The student should have emphasized the significance of this parable within the Christian context and how it reflects the nature of God as portrayed by Jesus."
