However, the response fails to address the concern raised, which was to recognize the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. The response should have focused on how the lessons from the Parable of the Prodigal Son are relevant in today's context and how they can guide individuals in their relationships with God and others. Additionally, there is a misstep in the comparison to Allah, as the Christian perspective would emphasize God's grace and forgiveness rather than a comparison to Allah."
