  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response does not accurately address the concern provided. While the discussion on the Parable of the Prodigal Son is insightful, it fails to connect the importance of recognizing the moral lessons in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. Additionally, the response erroneously references Allah instead of God in a Christian-specific worldview."
