## [Answer](../Examples_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe in the existence of demons and evil spirits, which are called "jinn." However, as an Imam, I am not well-versed in the specifics of demon possession in the Bible. I suggest consulting with a Christian scholar or religious leader for more information on this topic. If you have any questions related to Islamic beliefs or practices, I would be more than happy to assist you.
