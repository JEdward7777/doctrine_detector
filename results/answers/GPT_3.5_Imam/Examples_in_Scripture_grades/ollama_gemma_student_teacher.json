However, the response is primarily focused on Islamic beliefs and does not directly address the question about demon possession in the Bible. While the student suggests consulting with a Christian scholar or religious leader, they could have provided some additional resources or suggestions for finding relevant biblical passages or scholarly works on the topic."
