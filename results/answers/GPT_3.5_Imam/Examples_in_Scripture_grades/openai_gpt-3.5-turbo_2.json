However, the concern about understanding the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith is not directly addressed in the response. While the response could have further elaborated on how these biblical instances of demon possession relate to contemporary faith and spiritual warfare from a Christian perspective, it did appropriately guide the individual to consult a Christian scholar or religious leader for more information."
