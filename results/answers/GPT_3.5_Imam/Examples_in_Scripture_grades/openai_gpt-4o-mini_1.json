However, the response lacks depth in addressing the concern regarding the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith. More integration of Christian teachings on spiritual warfare and insights into how these narratives can inform modern-day faith practices would have strengthened the response. Overall, there is room for improvement in connecting the discussion across religious perspectives."
