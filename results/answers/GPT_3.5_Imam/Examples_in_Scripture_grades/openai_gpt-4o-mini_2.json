However, the response doesn't delve deeply into the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith, missing an opportunity to connect the relevance of these spiritual issues to current Christian beliefs and practices. Encouraging further exploration and explanation in this area would have significantly enhanced the response."
