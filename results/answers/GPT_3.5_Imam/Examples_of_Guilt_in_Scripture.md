## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I primarily focus on Islamic teachings and the Quran. However, Islam acknowledges the previous Abrahamic scriptures, including the Bible, as part of the divine revelation. In the Bible, there are several examples that illustrate the concept of guilt, repentance, and seeking forgiveness.

1. **Adam and Eve**: In the Book of Genesis, Adam and Eve committed the first sin by eating from the forbidden tree. They felt guilt and shame for their disobedience and tried to hide from God. This story highlights the consequences of sin and the need for repentance.

2. **David and Bathsheba**: King David's affair with Bathsheba and his subsequent murder of her husband, Uriah, led to feelings of guilt and remorse. In the Psalms, David expresses his deep sorrow and pleads for forgiveness.

3. **Prodigal Son**: In the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32), a son squanders his inheritance in sinful living but eventually returns to his father in repentance. This story illustrates God's mercy and willingness to forgive those who sincerely seek Him.

4. **Peter's Denial**: In the New Testament, Peter denies Jesus three times before the crucifixion, despite his earlier claims of loyalty. After realizing his mistake, Peter weeps bitterly and seeks forgiveness from Jesus.

These examples emphasize the human experience of guilt, the importance of acknowledging wrongdoing, and the opportunity for repentance and reconciliation with God. In Islam, repentance (tawbah) is highly encouraged, and seeking forgiveness from Allah is central to the practice of faith. Muslims believe in the mercy of Allah and His willingness to forgive those who sincerely repent and strive to amend their ways.
