  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of guilt, repentance, and seeking forgiveness. However, the response did not directly address the concern of how these examples help us understand guilt in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment. Additionally, the examples chosen were more general in nature and did not align closely with the specific concern provided."
