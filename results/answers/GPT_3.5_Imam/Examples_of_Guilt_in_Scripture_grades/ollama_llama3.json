The original answer provided focuses on Pilate's declaration of Jesus' innocence and a robber's acknowledgment of their own guilt, but these examples do not explicitly address the concern.\n\nThe response does provide some examples that touch on the theme of guilt and seeking forgiveness, such as Adam and Eve's feelings of guilt and shame, David's remorse over his sin, the prodigal son's return to his father in repentance, and Peter's weeping and seeking forgiveness. However, these examples do not directly address the concern about divine judgment.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more explicit connections between the biblical examples and the concept of guilt operating within the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment."
