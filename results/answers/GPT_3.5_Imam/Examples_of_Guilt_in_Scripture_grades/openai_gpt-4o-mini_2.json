  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively incorporates the provided biblical example and concern by showcasing how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence. The examples cited from the Bible align well with the concern raised, emphasizing the need for divine judgment and the concept of repentance and seeking forgiveness. The integration of these concepts from a Muslim perspective is cohesive and allows for a deeper understanding within a Christian worldview."
