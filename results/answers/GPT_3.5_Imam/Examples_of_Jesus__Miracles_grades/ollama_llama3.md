1. **Healing the sick**: Jesus performed numerous miracles of healing, curing people of various illnesses and disabilities. These miracles demonstrated his compassion, power, and authority over all aspects of life, including sickness and health.

2. **Raising the dead**: Jesus raised several people from the dead, including Lazarus. This miracle not only showed his power over death but also served as a sign of his authority as the one who brings eternal life.

3. **Feeding the multitude**: Jesus miraculously fed thousands of people with a few loaves of bread and fish on multiple occasions. This signified his ability to provide for the physical needs of his followers and demonstrated his divine nature as the Bread of Life.

4. **Walking on water**: Jesus walked on water to reach his disciples who were in a boat during a storm. This miracle showed his mastery over the forces of nature and his ability to provide comfort and security to his followers in times of trouble.

5. **Turning water into wine**: At the wedding in Cana, Jesus turned water into wine, his first public miracle. This demonstrated his power over the elements and signified the beginning of his ministry, symbolizing the abundance and joy that he brings to those who believe in him.

These miracles were significant because they affirmed Jesus' identity as the Messiah, the Son of God, and the Savior of humanity. They also served as signs to draw people to faith in him and to point towards the kingdom of God.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response does a good job of providing specific examples of Jesus' miracles, including some that are mentioned in the provided answer (raising people from the dead) as well as others not explicitly mentioned (calming a storm, healing a blind man). The response also attempts to explain the significance of these miracles, stating that they serve as signs of His divinity and God's kingdom.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. First, it does not explicitly address the concern about recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in our belief in Him as the Son of God. While it touches on this idea briefly, it would be helpful to have more explicit discussion on how these miracles demonstrate Jesus' divinity and why they are important for our faith.

Second, while the response provides some good examples of Jesus' miracles, it could benefit from a more comprehensive overview of the various types of miracles attributed to Jesus in Scripture. For example, the provided answer mentions calming a storm, but does not mention other miracles such as turning water into wine or feeding the multitude.

Overall, I would give this response a grade of 85 because it provides some good examples and attempts to explain their significance, but could be improved by providing more explicit discussion on how these miracles relate to our faith and a more comprehensive overview of Jesus' various miracles.
