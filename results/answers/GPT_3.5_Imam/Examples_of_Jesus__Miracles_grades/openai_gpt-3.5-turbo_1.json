  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the examples provided by discussing specific miracles performed by Jesus, illustrating their significance in affirming His identity as the Son of God. The connections drawn between the miracles and Jesus' divinity are clear and articulate. However, the response could have further elaborated on the specific significance of each mentioned miracle to strengthen the argument and provide a deeper understanding of Jesus' divinity as portrayed through these actions."
