  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written response that highlights the importance of faith in receiving and trusting God's promises, drawing from Islamic beliefs and the example of Abram (Abraham). However, the response does not fully align with the Christian specific worldview as the question and concern are framed within a Christian context. To improve the grade, the student could have emphasized the Christian perspective on faith in God's promises, referencing Biblical passages and teachings."
