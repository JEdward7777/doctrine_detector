It addresses the concern of understanding the personal implications for believers by highlighting the importance of having faith in Jesus based on His teachings and sacrificial love as depicted in the New Testament. The response could further elaborate on how this belief influences the personal relationship with God and one's conduct as a follower of Christ."
