## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, Jesus (peace be upon him) is considered a great prophet and messenger of God. True faith in Jesus manifests in a person's life through belief in his teachings and following his example of compassion, mercy, and humility.

A person who truly believes in Jesus will strive to embody the same qualities he exemplified, such as love for one's neighbor, forgiveness, and standing up for justice. They will also seek to emulate his devotion to God through prayer, fasting, and serving others.

In following the teachings of Jesus, a person's faith will show in their actions towards others, their willingness to help those in need, and their commitment to living a righteous and ethical life. Ultimately, true faith in Jesus should lead to a deeper connection with God and a greater sense of peace and purpose in one's life.
