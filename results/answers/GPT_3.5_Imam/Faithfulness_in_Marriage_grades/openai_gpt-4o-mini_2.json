It incorporates relevant verses from the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad for the Islamic perspective, and also references a specific biblical passage (Matthew 5:28) for the Christian perspective. The emphasis on maintaining integrity and faithfulness in marriage from both worldviews is clearly articulated."
