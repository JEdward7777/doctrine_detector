## [Answer](../Faithfulness_in_Marriage.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, faithfulness in marriage is of utmost importance and adultery is considered a major sin. The Quran clearly prohibits adultery and emphasizes the sanctity of marriage. 

In Surah Al-Isra (17:32), Allah says, "And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way." This verse prohibits any form of illicit relationships outside of marriage.

Regarding the consequences of adultery, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "When a man commits adultery, faith departs from him and there remains only a little substance of it." (Sahih Al-Bukhari)

Therefore, faithfulness in marriage and guarding oneself against adultery is an important aspect of maintaining a healthy and Islamic marriage. Muslims are encouraged to strengthen their marital bond, communicate openly with their spouse, fulfill each other's needs, and seek help from Allah to resist temptation and maintain fidelity in the relationship.
