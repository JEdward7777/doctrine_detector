The answer lacks doctrinal correctness as it focuses on Islamic beliefs and practices rather than Christian teachings. In a Christian-specific worldview, faithfulness to God is based on following the teachings of Jesus Christ, living a life in accordance with the Bible, and relying on God's grace and redemption through Christ."
