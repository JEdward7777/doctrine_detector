Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer provided a thorough explanation of faithfulness in Islam, however, the question specifically asked for the biblical definition of being faithful to God. The answer did not address the Christian context or teachings from the Bible, which was the specified concern. Therefore, the student's response deviated from the required focus and did not align with the Christian worldview.
