**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of faithfulness in a **Muslim** context, but fails to address the specific concern of faithfulness according to the **biblical** definition. While the concepts of obedience, loyalty, and living according to teachings are relevant across religions, the student's answer does not provide insight into how these concepts are specifically understood or applied within Christianity.
