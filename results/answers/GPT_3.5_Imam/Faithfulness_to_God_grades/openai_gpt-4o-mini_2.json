However, the response falls short in addressing the Christian context specifically. A Christian perspective would emphasize faithfulness as not just a duty or obedience but also a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ, involving trust, love, and surrender to His will. Expanding on this aspect would have strengthened the response."
