  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and well-structured explanation of favoritism within an Islamic context. The explanation aligns with Islamic teachings on justice, fairness, and treating others with respect. The student effectively highlighted the negative effects of favoritism on relationships, such as undermining trust, creating division, and causing harm to others. The inclusion of quotes from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) adds depth to the response. However, the student could further strengthen the answer by providing more specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate the impact of favoritism in practice."
