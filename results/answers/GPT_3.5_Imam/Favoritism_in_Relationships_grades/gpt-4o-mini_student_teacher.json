They accurately highlighted the negative effects of favoritism such as undermining trust, creating division, injustice, and harming others. The student also emphasized the importance of fairness, kindness, and respect in Islam. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the given concern by focusing more on the Christian perspective on favoritism and relating it to biblical teachings on fairness and loving treatment of all individuals."
