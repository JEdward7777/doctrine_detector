However, it does not directly address the specific concern of the significance of fellowship with God in Christianity and how it impacts a believer's spiritual growth and relationship with God. The response could have been improved by contrasting the Christian belief in the role of Jesus' sacrifice in establishing a personal relationship with God with the Islamic perspective."
