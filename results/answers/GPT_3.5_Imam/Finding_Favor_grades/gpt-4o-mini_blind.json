While it correctly mentions gaining God's approval and blessings through righteousness, faithfulness, and obedience, it should have focused more on the grace and mercy of God as central themes in finding favor with Him. Additionally, the reference to the Quran and Islamic teachings is unnecessary in explaining the biblical concept of finding favor with God. More emphasis on the unique Christian understanding of 'finding favor' within the context of salvation through Christ would have improved the answer significantly."
