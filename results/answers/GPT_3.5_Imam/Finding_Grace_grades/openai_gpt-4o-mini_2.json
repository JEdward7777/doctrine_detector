It also addresses the concern by outlining how one can seek and recognize God's favor in their life through fulfilling religious obligations, seeking forgiveness, and showing kindness to others. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of grace and favor in the Christian worldview, which would have made the explanation more aligned with a Christian-specific perspective."
