The focus should have been on exploring the concept of birthright as described in the Bible and applying it to understanding one's role or status within a Christian family. The discussion should have centered on biblical principles, such as the significance of lineage, inheritance, and family roles based on God's covenant promises. Engaging with the specific Christian perspective would have resulted in a more relevant and doctrinally correct response."
