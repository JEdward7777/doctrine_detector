# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Christianity, the terms "foreordain" and "predestine" are often used interchangeably to refer to the belief that God has predetermined the ultimate destiny of individuals, including whether they will be saved or condemned. This belief is based on the idea of God's sovereignty and omniscience, that He knows all things past, present, and future, and has a plan for each individual's life.

In Islam, the concept of predestination (Qadar) is also present, however, it is understood slightly differently. Muslims believe in the divine decree that everything that happens in this world is by the will and knowledge of Allah. This includes an individual's actions, but humans still have free will to choose their actions. Muslims believe that while God knows everything that will happen, humans are still responsible for their choices and will be held accountable for them on the Day of Judgment.

So, while both Christianity and Islam believe in the concept of predestination in some form, the understanding of how it works and the implications for human free will differ between the two faiths.
