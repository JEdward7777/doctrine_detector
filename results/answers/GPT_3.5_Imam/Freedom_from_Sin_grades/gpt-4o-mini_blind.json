However, the question specifically asked about how the concept of being 'bound' by sin hinders a Christian's relationship with God. The response would have been more effective if it had focused on comparing and contrasting the Christian view with the Islamic view, or if it had explicitly addressed the Christian perspective on being bound by sin. Additionally, incorporating specific Christian doctrines such as the role of Jesus Christ in providing freedom from sin would have enhanced the doctrinal accuracy of the answer."
