2. **Patience (Sabr)**: This is the ability to remain steadfast in the face of adversity and to persevere in times of difficulty.

3. **Gratitude (Shukr)**: Showing thankfulness to Allah for all His blessings, big and small.

4. **Forgiveness (Silm)**: Pardoning others and seeking reconciliation, even when wronged.

5. **Humility (Tawadu)**: Being modest and humble in interactions with others, recognizing that all blessings come from Allah.

6. **Compassion and Kindness (Rahma)**: Showing mercy and kindness to all of Allah's creation.

7. **Honesty and Truthfulness (Sidq)**: Speaking the truth and being honest in all dealings.

8. **Generosity (Sakhawat)**: Sharing one's wealth and resources with those in need.

9. **Good Character (Husn al-Khulq)**: Behaving with integrity, respect, and dignity towards others.

10. **Patience (Sabr)**: Enduring hardships and tests with patience and resilience.

These fruits of Iman are meant to guide and inspire Muslims to lead a virtuous and fulfilling life, in accordance with the teachings of Islam.
