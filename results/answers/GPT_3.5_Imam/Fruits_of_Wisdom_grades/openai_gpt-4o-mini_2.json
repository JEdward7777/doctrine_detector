  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response provided a list of virtues, it failed to specifically address the fruits of the Holy Spirit as outlined in the concern. The fruits of the Holy Spirit are traditionally recognized as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). It is important to align the response with the Christian worldview by specifically mentioning and discussing these fruits within the context of spiritual growth and reflecting Christ-like character."
