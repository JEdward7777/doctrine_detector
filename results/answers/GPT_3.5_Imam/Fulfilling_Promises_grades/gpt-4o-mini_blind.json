  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 60.\n\nThe answer provides a detailed explanation of the importance of fulfilling promises and vows in Islam, specifically mentioning the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and a relevant Quranic verse. The student shows a good understanding of the topic within the Islamic perspective.\n\nHowever, the answer did not address the Christian perspective as requested in the question. The focus on Islam, while informative, deviates from the question's specific prompt. To improve the grade, the student should have discussed the Christian belief regarding fulfilling promises and vows made before God."
