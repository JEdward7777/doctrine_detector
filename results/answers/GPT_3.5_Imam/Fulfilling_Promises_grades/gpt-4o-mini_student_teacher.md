In Islam, fulfilling promises and vows made before Allah is considered extremely important. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of fulfilling one's promises and commitments. It is seen as a sign of honesty, integrity, and the fear of Allah.

Allah says in the Quran, in Surah Al-Isra (17:34), "And fulfill every promise. Indeed, the promise is a responsibility." This verse highlights the obligation of fulfilling promises in Islam.

Therefore, in the Islamic perspective, it is a serious matter to make promises or vows before Allah and not fulfill them. Muslims are encouraged to fulfill their commitments and promises to the best of their ability, as it reflects their sincerity and devotion to Allah.
