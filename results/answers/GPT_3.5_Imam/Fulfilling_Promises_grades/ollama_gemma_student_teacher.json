They correctly point out the Quranic verse highlighting the obligation to fulfill promises and connect it to Islamic teachings about honesty and integrity. \n\nHowever, the answer is not specifically tailored to the Christian worldview as requested in the prompt. It would be more appropriate to address the concern from a Christian theological perspective, referencing relevant passages from the Bible or Christian traditions."
