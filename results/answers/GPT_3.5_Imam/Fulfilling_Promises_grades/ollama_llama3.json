  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response successfully addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of keeping one's word in Islam, citing relevant Quranic verses, and emphasizing its significance in reflecting one's integrity and devotion to Allah. The language used is clear and concise, making it easy to understand for readers unfamiliar with Islamic teachings.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response doesn't explicitly explore the potential consequences of breaking promises or vows in Islam. While it mentions the importance of fulfilling commitments, it could delve deeper into the implications of failure to do so on one's faith and relationship with Allah.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively communicates the significance of keeping one's word from an Islamic perspective."
