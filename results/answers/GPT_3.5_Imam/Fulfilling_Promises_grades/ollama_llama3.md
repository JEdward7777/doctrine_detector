## [Answer](../Fulfilling_Promises.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, fulfilling promises and vows made before Allah is considered extremely important. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of fulfilling one's promises and commitments. It is seen as a sign of honesty, integrity, and the fear of Allah.

Allah says in the Quran, in Surah Al-Isra (17:34), "And fulfill every promise. Indeed, the promise is a responsibility." This verse highlights the obligation of fulfilling promises in Islam.

Therefore, in the Islamic perspective, it is a serious matter to make promises or vows before Allah and not fulfill them. Muslims are encouraged to fulfill their commitments and promises to the best of their ability, as it reflects their sincerity and devotion to Allah.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 85.

The response successfully addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of keeping one's word in Islam, citing relevant Quranic verses, and emphasizing its significance in reflecting one's integrity and devotion to Allah. The language used is clear and concise, making it easy to understand for readers unfamiliar with Islamic teachings.

However, I deduct a few points because the response doesn't explicitly explore the potential consequences of breaking promises or vows in Islam. While it mentions the importance of fulfilling commitments, it could delve deeper into the implications of failure to do so on one's faith and relationship with Allah.

Overall, this is a strong response that effectively communicates the significance of keeping one's word from an Islamic perspective.
