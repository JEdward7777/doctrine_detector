It aligns well with the concerns raised regarding the impact of keeping one's word on one's faith. The reference to the Quranic verse and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad further strengthens the argument from an Islamic perspective. Overall, a well-supported and thorough explanation from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
