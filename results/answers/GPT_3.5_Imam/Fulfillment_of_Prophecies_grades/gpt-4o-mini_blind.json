The student should have focused on explaining the Christian understanding of prophecy fulfillment according to Biblical teaching, rather than solely discussing Islamic beliefs. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the scriptural basis for prophecy fulfillment in Christianity and the significance of fulfilled prophecies in validating the authority of God's Word."
