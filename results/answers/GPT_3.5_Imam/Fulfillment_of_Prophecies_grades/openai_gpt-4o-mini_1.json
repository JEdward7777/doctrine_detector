It effectively addressed the concern by illustrating how God's involvement leads to the fulfillment of prophecies, fitting well within a Christian worldview where God's sovereignty over prophecy is paramount. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific references to Islamic scripture or teachings to bolster the explanation further."
