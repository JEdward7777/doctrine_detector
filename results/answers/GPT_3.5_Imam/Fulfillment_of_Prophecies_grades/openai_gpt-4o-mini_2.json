The connection between prophecy fulfillment and the credibility of prophets is well elaborated upon. However, from a Christian perspective, it would be important to point out the distinction of Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of prophecies in the Bible. Additionally, highlighting the concept of God's sovereignty and His direct involvement in prophecy realization would further strengthen the response."
