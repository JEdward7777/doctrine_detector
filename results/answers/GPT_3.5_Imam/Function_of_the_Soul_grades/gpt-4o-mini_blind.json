  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a well-written and insightful exploration of the concept of the soul in Islam, the response deviates significantly from the Christian specific worldview requested for grading. The focus on Islamic beliefs and teachings, rather than those of Christianity, detracts from the relevance to the question. To improve the grade, the student should address the figurative uses of the word 'soul' in the Bible itself, drawing from Christian scripture to discuss the importance of the soul in understanding human identity from a Christian worldview."
