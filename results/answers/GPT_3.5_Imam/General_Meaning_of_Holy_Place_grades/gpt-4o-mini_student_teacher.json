  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how the term 'holy place' is understood in Islam, highlighting the belief in the sacredness of various locations and the importance of these sites in Islamic tradition. However, the student did not directly address the concern of identifying places in life that are dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter beyond physical structures like the tabernacle or temple. The response focused more on specific locations and general spiritual connections, rather than broader contexts of dedicated spiritual significance in daily life."
