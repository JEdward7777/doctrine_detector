It effectively addresses the concern by identifying specific locations, like the Kaaba and mosques, dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter in Islamic tradition. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of setting apart these places for worship and the practice of maintaining their sanctity in line with the Christian perspective on holy places."
