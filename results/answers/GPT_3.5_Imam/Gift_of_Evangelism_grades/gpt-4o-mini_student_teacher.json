  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of evangelism among Christians and acknowledges that not all Christians identify as evangelists. However, the response does not address the concern about the spiritual gifts related to evangelism and their role in the church from a Christian perspective. In a Christian worldview, evangelists are distinguished by being given a special spiritual gift to effectively share the Gospel with others. The student should have incorporated this aspect into their explanation to fully address the concern provided."
