The inclusion of key practices such as Salah, Dhikr, following the Sunnah, and helping others aligns well with Islamic principles. However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to note that glorifying God also involves acknowledging Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the savior of humanity. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of repentance and seeking forgiveness for sins would further enhance the completeness of the answer."
