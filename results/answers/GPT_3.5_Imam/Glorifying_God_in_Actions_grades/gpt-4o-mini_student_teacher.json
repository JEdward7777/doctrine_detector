While the answer is well-structured and informative, it does not directly address the concern of emphasizing the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness. The response focused more on the actions and practices within Islam rather than specifically highlighting the aspect of reflecting God's glory to others through sharing testimonies of His goodness and living according to His character and commandments."
