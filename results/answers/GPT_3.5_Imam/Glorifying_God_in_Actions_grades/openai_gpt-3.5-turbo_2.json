The emphasis on prayer, remembrance of God, gratitude, following the example of Prophet Muhammad, seeking knowledge, helping others, avoiding sin, and engaging in intentional acts of worship aligns well with the concern of living a life that honors God's greatness. The integration of Islamic principles with the concept of glorifying God is well-articulated and highlights the importance of aligning one's actions with God's character and commandments."
