# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, the concept of being "born again" is not as commonly referred to as it is in some Christian traditions. However, the idea of spiritual rebirth or transformation is certainly present in Islamic teachings.

In Islam, God's role in the process of a person's spiritual transformation is central. It is believed that true guidance and spiritual awakening come from God alone. It is through His mercy, grace, and guidance that a person's heart is opened to faith and their life is transformed for the better.

Muslims believe that God continuously invites people to return to Him, seek forgiveness, and lead a more righteous life. It is up to the individual to respond to this invitation with sincerity and humility. Through repentance, prayer, good deeds, and seeking closeness to God, a person can experience a spiritual rebirth and a deepening of their faith.

Ultimately, in Islam, the process of spiritual transformation is a deeply personal journey between the individual and God. It is through seeking God's guidance, following His teachings, and striving to become a better person that a Muslim can experience a sense of spiritual rebirth and closeness to the Divine.

Comment: The response effectively emphasizes God's role in the process of spiritual transformation within Islam, highlighting the belief in God's guidance, mercy, and grace as essential for a person's rebirth. It underscores the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and initiative in the process of spiritual awakening, aligning well with the specified concern. However, the response could have further emphasized the distinct Christian concept of being "born again" as a transformative experience indicating a new spiritual life in Christ.
