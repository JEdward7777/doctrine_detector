  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: While the student provides an interpretation of Jesus' statement, the response does not align with a Christian worldview. As the question pertains to Jesus and his teachings within Christianity, the answer's emphasis on Islamic belief and the role of Jesus in Islam is not relevant. The focus should be on the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God and the affirmation of God's absolute goodness within the context of the Trinity. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and clarity in addressing the Christian perspective on Jesus' statement."
