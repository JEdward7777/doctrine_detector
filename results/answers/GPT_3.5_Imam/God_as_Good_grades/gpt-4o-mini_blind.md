## Question [God as Good](../../../questions/God_as_Good.md)
What does Jesus mean when he states, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God'?

## Correct Answer
This statement emphasizes the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.

## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In this statement, Jesus is affirming the absolute goodness and perfection of God. He is emphasizing the unique and unparalleled goodness of God, highlighting that human beings, including himself as a human being, are not at the same level of perfection and goodness as God. Jesus, as a messenger of God in Islamic belief, is recognizing and emphasizing the exclusive divine attribute of goodness that belongs only to God. This statement reflects the Islamic belief in the transcendence and perfection of God's attributes, including His goodness.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 50

Comments: While the student provides an interpretation of Jesus' statement, the response does not align with a Christian worldview. As the question pertains to Jesus and his teachings within Christianity, the answer's emphasis on Islamic belief and the role of Jesus in Islam is not relevant. The focus should be on the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God and the affirmation of God's absolute goodness within the context of the Trinity. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and clarity in addressing the Christian perspective on Jesus' statement.
