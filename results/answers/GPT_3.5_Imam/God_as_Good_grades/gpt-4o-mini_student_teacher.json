  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a perspective from Islamic belief rather than a Christian perspective, which is the worldview specified for this grading. The student correctly identifies the importance of God's goodness, but fails to specifically address the Christian understanding of Jesus' statement. Therefore, the grade is lowered for not aligning with the Christian worldview in the response."
