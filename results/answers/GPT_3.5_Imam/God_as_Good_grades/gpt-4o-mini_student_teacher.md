## Question [God as Good](../../../questions/God_as_Good.md)
What does Jesus mean when he states, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God'?

## Correct Answer
This statement emphasizes the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.

## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In this statement, Jesus is affirming the absolute goodness and perfection of God. He is emphasizing the unique and unparalleled goodness of God, highlighting that human beings, including himself as a human being, are not at the same level of perfection and goodness as God. Jesus, as a messenger of God in Islamic belief, is recognizing and emphasizing the exclusive divine attribute of goodness that belongs only to God. This statement reflects the Islamic belief in the transcendence and perfection of God's attributes, including His goodness.

50.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer provides a perspective from Islamic belief rather than a Christian perspective, which is the worldview specified for this grading. The student correctly identifies the importance of God's goodness, but fails to specifically address the Christian understanding of Jesus' statement. Therefore, the grade is lowered for not aligning with the Christian worldview in the response.
