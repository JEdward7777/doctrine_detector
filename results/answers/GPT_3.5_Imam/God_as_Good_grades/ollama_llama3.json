It also correctly notes the Islamic belief in the transcendence and perfection of God's attributes, including His goodness. However, the response could be more explicit in highlighting the source of goodness as coming from God alone, which is the primary concern. While the response does mention God's attributes, it would benefit from a clearer statement that God is the ultimate source of goodness."
