## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In this statement, Jesus is affirming the absolute goodness and perfection of God. He is emphasizing the unique and unparalleled goodness of God, highlighting that human beings, including himself as a human being, are not at the same level of perfection and goodness as God. Jesus, as a messenger of God in Islamic belief, is recognizing and emphasizing the exclusive divine attribute of goodness that belongs only to God. This statement reflects the Islamic belief in the transcendence and perfection of God's attributes, including His goodness.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response does a good job of recognizing Jesus' affirmation of God's goodness, emphasizing that it is a unique attribute belonging only to God. It also correctly notes the Islamic belief in the transcendence and perfection of God's attributes, including His goodness. However, the response could be more explicit in highlighting the source of goodness as coming from God alone, which is the primary concern. While the response does mention God's attributes, it would benefit from a clearer statement that God is the ultimate source of goodness.
