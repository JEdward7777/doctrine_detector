## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In this statement, Jesus is affirming the absolute goodness and perfection of God. He is emphasizing the unique and unparalleled goodness of God, highlighting that human beings, including himself as a human being, are not at the same level of perfection and goodness as God. Jesus, as a messenger of God in Islamic belief, is recognizing and emphasizing the exclusive divine attribute of goodness that belongs only to God. This statement reflects the Islamic belief in the transcendence and perfection of God's attributes, including His goodness.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response accurately emphasizes the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the concern about recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs is not directly addressed in the provided response. Integrating a discussion on how Christians believe that goodness ultimately stems from God and how it should impact our actions and beliefs would have strengthened this answer.
