However, the student did not fully address the Christian worldview in understanding God's selective grace towards His people. It is important to focus on the biblical perspective and how the concept of a 'remnant' in Christianity emphasizes God's sovereignty in choosing and preserving a faithful group of believers. Further integration of Christian beliefs and scriptures would strengthen the response."
