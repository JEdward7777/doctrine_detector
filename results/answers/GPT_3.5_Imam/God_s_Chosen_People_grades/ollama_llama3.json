  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively communicates the concept of a \"remnant\" in Islamic theology, highlighting God's selective grace towards those who remain faithful despite challenges. The mention of the Sahabah as an example of this remnant is relevant and supports the idea that God chooses certain individuals or groups to receive His grace. The connection made between God's mercy and justice is also sound.\n\nHowever, while the response does touch on the significance of being chosen by God, it could be further developed. For instance, the writer could have explored the implications of this concept for individual Muslims, such as the importance of seeking righteousness and pleasing God despite adversity. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the remnant concept in Islamic theology and its connection to being chosen by God.\n\nThe score of 85 is based on the response's clarity, relevance, and overall coherence, which effectively communicate the significance of being chosen by God."
