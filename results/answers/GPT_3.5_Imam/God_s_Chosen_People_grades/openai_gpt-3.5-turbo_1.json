The discussion on God's selective grace, the Quranic references, and the reflection on mercy and justice align well with the concern of recognizing the significance of being chosen by God from a Christian worldview. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept and provides a thoughtful reflection on its implications for one's faith and actions."
