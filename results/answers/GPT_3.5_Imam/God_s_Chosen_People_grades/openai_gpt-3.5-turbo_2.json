  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the concept of a \"remnant\" in Islamic theology and effectively relates it to the idea of God's selective grace towards certain individuals or groups. The mention of the Sahabah as an example is particularly relevant. The response also acknowledges the significance of being chosen by God in receiving His grace and fulfilling His promises. Overall, it successfully addresses the concern raised within a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of God's sovereign choice."
