  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response does a good job of explaining how the concept of being \"called by my name\" reflects an intimate relationship with Allah in Islam. However, the answer lacks a Christian-specific perspective on the topic, which is necessary when grading from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate Christian teachings and beliefs about God's calling and relationship with His people, demonstrating a clear understanding of Christian doctrine."
