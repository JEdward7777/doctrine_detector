  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how the concept of being \"called by my name\" reflects the relationship with Allah in Islam. However, the student deviated from the Christian-specific worldview by focusing on Islamic beliefs and practices rather than addressing the concern with Christian perspectives. The response lacks the Christian interpretation of the concept and does not directly explore the implications of identity and belonging to God in a Christian's life."
