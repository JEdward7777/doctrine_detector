  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of being \"called by my name\" in a Christian context. However, it focuses on Islamic perspectives rather than Christian perspectives as specified in the prompt. The answer correctly highlights the personal and loving relationship between believers and their Creator, but it would benefit from addressing the Christian understanding of this concept."
