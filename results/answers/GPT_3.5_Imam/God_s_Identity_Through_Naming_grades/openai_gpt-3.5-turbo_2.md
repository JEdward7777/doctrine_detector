In Islam, the concept of being "called by my name" reflects the intimate and personal relationship that believers have with Allah. Throughout the Quran, Allah is referred to by many beautiful names and attributes, each carrying a unique and profound meaning. When Allah calls us by name, it signifies His knowledge of us on an individual level, showing His care, concern, and love for each of His creations.

As believers, when we invoke the names of Allah in prayer or remembrance, we are reminded of His limitless mercy, compassion, and power. We are encouraged to develop a deep connection with Him through these names, seeking His guidance, forgiveness, and blessings in our daily lives.

Furthermore, the concept of being "called by my name" also highlights the importance of our response to Allah's call. As Muslims, we are encouraged to strive for righteousness, obedience, and submission to His will in all aspects of our lives. By recognizing and responding to His call, we strengthen our relationship with Him and deepen our faith.

Overall, the concept of being "called by my name" serves as a reminder of the personal and loving relationship that exists between believers and their Creator. It inspires us to constantly seek His pleasure, guidance, and mercy, while also trusting in His wisdom and grace.
