It aligns well with the provided answer while also addressing the concern regarding the intentional nature of God's interaction. The explanation is coherent, insightful, and reflective of a Christian worldview that values divine guidance and purpose in human lives. Great job connecting the Islamic perspective to the Christian worldview."
