However, when addressing the concept of justification, the student's explanation does not align with the Christian view. In Christianity, justification is a legal declaration by God where He declares a sinner righteous based on the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The response would have been stronger if it had included this distinction, as justification in Christianity is not based on human repentance or actions, but on faith in Christ."
