  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of justification in Islam, highlighting the importance of repentance, seeking forgiveness, and sincere remorse. \n\nWhile the answer correctly focuses on Islamic concepts of forgiveness and repentance, it lacks the specific reference to Jesus Christ and his role in salvation, which is central to the Christian doctrine of justification. This omission is the primary reason for the slightly lower grade.\n\nOverall, the answer is well-written and thoughtfully articulated, showcasing a good grasp of the subject matter."
