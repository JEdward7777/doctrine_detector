The provided answer is also not directly addressed or engaged with. The response primarily focuses on Islamic concepts and practices, which are not relevant to the given concern. To improve this response, it would be necessary to provide a clearer connection to the original question and engage more directly with the Christian doctrine of justification.\n\nIn terms of content, the response does an adequate job of explaining the Islamic view on repentance and forgiveness, but it lacks depth and nuance. The language is straightforward, but it could benefit from more context and illustration to make the points more relatable and memorable."
