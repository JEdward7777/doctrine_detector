It addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding the significance of God's name can deepen reverence and understanding in worship. The response also acknowledges the differences in how God is referred to in Islam, while emphasizing the importance of reverence, love, and obedience towards God regardless of the name used. Great job incorporating a Christian worldview perspective."
