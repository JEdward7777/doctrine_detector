However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to also emphasize that God's almightiness is not just about power and control but also about His holiness, righteousness, and perfect attributes. Adding a brief mention of God's holiness and other attributes would provide a more holistic understanding of the term \"Almighty\" in relation to God's nature."
