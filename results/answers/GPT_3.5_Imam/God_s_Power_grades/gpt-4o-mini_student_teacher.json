  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student gave a comprehensive explanation of what the term \"Almighty\" signifies about God's nature from their Islamic perspective, emphasizing His absolute power, strength, and sovereignty. They correctly highlighted the unlimited authority and capability of God. However, from a Christian worldview, the focus would also be on God's omnipotence as a fundamental aspect of faith and worship, which was not explicitly emphasized in the student's answer."
