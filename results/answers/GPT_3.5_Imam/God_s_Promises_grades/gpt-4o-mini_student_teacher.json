  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student effectively discusses the significance of God's promises in Islam and how they provide guidance, assurance, and motivation to believers, the answer does not specifically address the context of God's relationship with His people in the examples from the Bible. There is a lack of direct comparison to the examples of Noah, Abram, and David as provided in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to connect their points to specific biblical examples would strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
