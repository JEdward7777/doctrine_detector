While it effectively discusses key promises such as mercy, forgiveness, guidance, and the hereafter, it does not directly address how understanding God's promises helps believers trust His faithfulness in their own lives as stated in the concern. Additionally, incorporating examples from Islamic scripture or history to illustrate how these promises have been fulfilled would strengthen the response."
