  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective on discerning God's plan, it does not directly address the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose. Additionally, the explanation is not aligned with a Christian worldview, which is the specific lens through which the answer should be evaluated in this context. The student could improve their answer by incorporating Christian beliefs and practices, such as referencing the Bible and Christian teachings on discerning God's will and seeking counsel from Christian mentors or leaders."
