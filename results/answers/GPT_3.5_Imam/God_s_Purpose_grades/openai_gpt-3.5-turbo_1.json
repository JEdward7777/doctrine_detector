However, from a Christian worldview, there is a notable difference in the understanding of divine destiny and decree. The response does not directly address the concern raised about believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling. Additionally, incorporating more specific references to Christian scriptures and prayer practices would have further enriched the response."
