  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful perspective on discerning God's plan from an Islamic viewpoint, emphasizing reliance on the Qur'an, teachings of Prophet Muhammad, prayer (dua), and acceptance of divine destiny. While the response does not directly address the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling, it offers a strong foundation for seeking clarity and guidance in God's plan. To improve the grade, linking this guidance to addressing spiritual uncertainty more directly could further enhance the response in addressing the specified concern."
