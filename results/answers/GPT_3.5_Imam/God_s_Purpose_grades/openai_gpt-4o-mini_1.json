While the response does not directly address the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose, it effectively communicates the importance of trusting in God's wisdom and finding peace through submission to His will. A slight deduction is made for not directly addressing the concern raised, but overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of seeking and accepting God's plan within the Islamic faith."
