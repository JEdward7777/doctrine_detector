In the Bible, God introduces Himself using various names that reveal different aspects of His divine nature. One of the significant names by which God introduces Himself is "Yahweh" or "Jehovah" in English translations. This name is often translated as "the Lord" in many English versions of the Bible. When Moses asked God for His name in Exodus 3:14, God responded, "I am who I am." This name signifies God's eternal and self-existent nature.

Other names of God found in the Bible include:

1. Elohim: This name emphasizes God's power and might as the Creator of the universe.
2. El-Shaddai: This name means "God Almighty" and highlights God's sovereignty and all-sufficiency.
3. El-Roi: This name means "the God who sees" and reveals God's omniscience and care for His people.
4. Jehovah-Jireh: This name means "the Lord will provide" and reflects God's provision and faithfulness.

These names convey different aspects of God's character and attributes, underscoring His greatness, holiness, and love for His creation.
