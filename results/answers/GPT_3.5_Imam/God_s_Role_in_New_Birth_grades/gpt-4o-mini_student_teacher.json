  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response provides insight into Islamic beliefs regarding spiritual transformation, it does not specifically address the Christian perspective on God's role in the process of being born again. The answer lacks a direct reference to God's sovereign work and grace in bringing about spiritual rebirth as emphasized in the Christian worldview. A higher grade could be achieved by aligning the response more closely with the Christian understanding of salvation through God's initiative and grace."
