  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written response that effectively explains how understanding the concept of an appointed time in Islam can enhance faith in God's plans. The student accurately conveys the importance of trusting in Allah's timing and submitting to His will. However, the grade is slightly lower because the response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern about the relationship between God's timing and our expectations in life. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic."
