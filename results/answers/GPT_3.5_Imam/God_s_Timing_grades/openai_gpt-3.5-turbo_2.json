It adequately addresses the concern by discussing the relationship between God's timing and our expectations in life, emphasizing the importance of trusting in Allah's plan even when things may not align with our hopes and desires. The integration of a Christian worldview would require some adaptation to align more closely with Christian beliefs about God's sovereignty and His timing in one's life."
