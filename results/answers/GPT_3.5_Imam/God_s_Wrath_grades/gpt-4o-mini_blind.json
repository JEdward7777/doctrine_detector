However, the focus of the question was on God's punishment during the 'day of Yahweh' specifically, which pertains to the Judeo-Christian tradition, not Islamic beliefs. The answer does not demonstrate a Christian-specific worldview in addressing the question. It is important to ensure that the response aligns with the context of the specific religious beliefs being addressed."
