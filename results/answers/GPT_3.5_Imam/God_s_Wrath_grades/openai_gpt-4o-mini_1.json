The inclusion of Quranic references adds depth to the answer. However, the initial answer focusing on God's punishment being described as a 'pouring out of God\u2019s wrath' could have been more explicitly linked to the detailed descriptions of punishment in the Islamic texts provided in the response. A stronger connection between the initial answer and the subsequent explanation would have further enhanced the coherence of the response."
