  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's answer eloquently highlights the emphasis on God's mercy, compassion, and guidance in Islam, it does not directly address the concept of 'zeal of the Lord' as specified in the question. The student's response, although insightful, does not align closely enough with the Christian-specific understanding of God's zeal as described in the reference answer. To improve the grade, the student should have focused more on God's active and persistent efforts to bless His people and ensure justice, emphasizing His unwavering commitment and passion for their well-being."
