  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective about the concept of God's zeal and how it relates to His mercy, compassion, and care for His followers. The inclusion of key Islamic beliefs about God's attributes of mercy and compassion enriches the understanding of His zeal. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how recognizing God's zeal can strengthen believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being. A slightly higher grade could be achieved by further integrating scriptural references or teachings from Islamic texts to support the explanation."
