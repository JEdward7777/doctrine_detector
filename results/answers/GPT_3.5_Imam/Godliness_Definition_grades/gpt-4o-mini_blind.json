The student should have focused more on the specific teachings and attributes of godliness as outlined in the Bible, rather than comparing it to Islamic beliefs. Additionally, a Christian worldview would emphasize the unique aspects of Christian godliness, such as faith in Jesus Christ, obedience to His teachings, and the transformation of the heart by the Holy Spirit."
