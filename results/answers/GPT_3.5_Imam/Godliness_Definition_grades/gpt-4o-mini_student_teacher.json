  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40 \n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on godliness, the response did not directly address the question posed from a Christian worldview. The focus was solely on the Islamic concept of godliness, with limited incorporation of the Bible's definition or practical application in daily life. Additionally, the student did not provide clarity on how to specifically incorporate godliness into daily life and actions from a Christian perspective."
