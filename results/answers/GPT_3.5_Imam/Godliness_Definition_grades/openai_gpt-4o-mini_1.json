It also effectively draws parallels between the Islamic and Christian perspectives on godliness, focusing on faith, moral conduct, and seeking a close relationship with the Divine. However, while the response addresses the concern by discussing the incorporation of godliness into daily life through adherence to Islamic principles, it could have provided more specific examples or practical suggestions for individuals to actively practice godliness in their daily actions."
