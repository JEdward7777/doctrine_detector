  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive explanation of virtues in Islam that reflect good character, they did not address the specific question regarding the fruits of the Holy Spirit as outlined in Christian theology. The answer lacked direct relevance to the question asked, resulting in a lower grade. However, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the characteristics of a godly individual within an Islamic context."
