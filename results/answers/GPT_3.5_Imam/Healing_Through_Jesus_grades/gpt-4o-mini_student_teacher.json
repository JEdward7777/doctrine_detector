  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer discussing different approaches Jesus used in healing demon-possessed individuals, including the power of his spoken word and the importance of prayer and fasting. While the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, it lacks specificity in focusing on the aspect of recognizing the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing, which was the specified concern. Additionally, the response could have been more concise and directly linked to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
