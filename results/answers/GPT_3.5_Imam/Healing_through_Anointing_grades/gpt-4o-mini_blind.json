  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the relationship between anointing and healing in the New Testament, citing the relevant passage in the Book of James. The student effectively conveys the significance of anointing with oil as a symbol of God's healing power and emphasizes the importance of faith, prayer, and seeking God's help in times of need. However, to improve the answer, the student could have delved deeper into the theological significance of anointing in relation to healing, such as discussing the sacramental aspect or the role of faith in healing. Additionally, connecting the practice of anointing to Jesus' own ministry of healing would have further enriched the response."
