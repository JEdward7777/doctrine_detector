  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the practice of anointing for healing in the New Testament, citing relevant scripture and emphasizing the importance of faith and prayer. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern by linking anointing with both spiritual and physical healing specifically as part of Christian practice."
