## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, anointing is often associated with healing and is mentioned in the context of the healing ministry of Jesus and his disciples. The act of anointing with oil is seen as a symbol of God's healing power and presence.

One of the most well-known instances of anointing for healing in the New Testament is found in the Book of James, where it says, "Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven" (James 5:14-15).

This practice of anointing the sick with oil and praying for healing is seen as a way to seek God's intervention and mercy in times of illness. It is believed that through prayer and anointing, one can experience physical, emotional, and spiritual healing according to God's will.

Overall, anointing for healing in the New Testament is a powerful reminder of the importance of faith, prayer, and seeking God's help in times of need.
