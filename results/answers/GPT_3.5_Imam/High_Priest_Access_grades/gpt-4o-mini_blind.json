  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good attempt at discussing the Ark of the Covenant from an Islamic perspective. However, the question specifically asked about the guidelines for approaching the Ark of the Covenant, which this response does not directly address. It correctly emphasizes the sacred nature of the Ark and the need for reverence, but lacks specific information on who was allowed to approach it and under what circumstances according to Islamic tradition. More clarity and focus on the specific guidelines would have improved the grade."
