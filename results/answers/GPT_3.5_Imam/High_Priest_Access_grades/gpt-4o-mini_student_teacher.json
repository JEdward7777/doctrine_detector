  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response provides some background on the Ark of the Covenant from an Islamic perspective, but it misses the key Christian-specific detail regarding the high priest's exclusive privilege to approach the ark, particularly emphasizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God. The answer does not accurately address the specific concern provided in the question, resulting in a lower grade."
