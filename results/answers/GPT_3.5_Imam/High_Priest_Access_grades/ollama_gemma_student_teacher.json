  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant. However, the answer is based on Islamic tradition rather than Christian theology. The reference answer provided clearly states that only the high priest could approach the ark, and it does not mention any other individuals or circumstances."
