  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning that only appointed priests and prophets were allowed to approach the Ark, but it does not specifically recognize the high priest's role in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant as emphasized in the correct answer. While it does mention the reverence and respect shown to the Ark, it does not delve deeper into the significance of the high priest's role in this context.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be important to explicitly acknowledge the high priest's unique position and responsibility in relation to the Ark and the covenant, as highlighted in the correct answer."
