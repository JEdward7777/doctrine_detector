  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately recognizes the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant by stating that only the high priest could approach the Ark, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement. The explanation provided aligns well with the concern raised, demonstrating a good understanding of the significance of the high priest in the context of the Ark of the Covenant. The response effectively integrates Christian theology into the discussion of this sacred artifact."
