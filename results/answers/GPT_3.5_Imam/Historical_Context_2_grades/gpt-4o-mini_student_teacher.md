## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt because they did not have enough time to let their bread rise before they had to flee. As mentioned in the Quran in Surah Taha (20:77), when Musa (peace be upon him) commanded his people to take their belongings and quickly leave Egypt, there was no time to prepare regular bread with leavening agents. So, they baked unleavened bread, which is quicker to make as it does not require the dough to rise.

Additionally, eating unleavened bread during the escape from Egypt became a symbol of remembrance and a way to commemorate their deliverance from slavery. This practice was later formalized as part of the observance of Passover in Judaism.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student provided some accurate information about the Israelites eating unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt, but their answer lacks a crucial component from a Christian perspective - the role of God's instructions. In a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize that God instructed the Israelites to eat unleavened bread as part of their deliverance from slavery. The student's inclusion of references from the Quran, while informative, deviates from the Christian perspective on this historical event. Encouraging the student to focus more on the role of God's guidance in shaping religious practices would improve their answer from a Christian worldview.
