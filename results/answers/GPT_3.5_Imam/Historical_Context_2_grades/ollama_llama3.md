## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt because they did not have enough time to let their bread rise before they had to flee. As mentioned in the Quran in Surah Taha (20:77), when Musa (peace be upon him) commanded his people to take their belongings and quickly leave Egypt, there was no time to prepare regular bread with leavening agents. So, they baked unleavened bread, which is quicker to make as it does not require the dough to rise.

Additionally, eating unleavened bread during the escape from Egypt became a symbol of remembrance and a way to commemorate their deliverance from slavery. This practice was later formalized as part of the observance of Passover in Judaism.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response as 80.

The response starts off strong, accurately explaining why the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt. The inclusion of the Quranic verse and Musa's command adds depth to the explanation. However, when it comes to recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices, the response falls short.

While it mentions that eating unleavened bread became a symbol of remembrance and commemoration of deliverance from slavery, this connection is not explicitly linked to God's instruction to flee Egypt quickly. The response could be strengthened by making a clearer link between the historical event (the escape from Egypt) and the religious practice (eating unleavened bread).

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context behind the Israelites' eating of unleavened bread, but could improve in connecting this to God's role in shaping religious practices.
