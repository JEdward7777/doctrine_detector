However, it did not explicitly mention the reason for God's instruction, which is crucial in understanding the deeper significance of the event. Additionally, while the response briefly touches on the commemorative aspect of the practice, it could have delved more into the spiritual and historical significance of this event as a foundation for religious practices in Judaism."
