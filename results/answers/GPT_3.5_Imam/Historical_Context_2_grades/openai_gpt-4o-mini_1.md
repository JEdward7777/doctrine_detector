## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt because they did not have enough time to let their bread rise before they had to flee. As mentioned in the Quran in Surah Taha (20:77), when Musa (peace be upon him) commanded his people to take their belongings and quickly leave Egypt, there was no time to prepare regular bread with leavening agents. So, they baked unleavened bread, which is quicker to make as it does not require the dough to rise.

Additionally, eating unleavened bread during the escape from Egypt became a symbol of remembrance and a way to commemorate their deliverance from slavery. This practice was later formalized as part of the observance of Passover in Judaism.

Comment: The response provides a well-explained connection between the historical events (God's instruction to flee Egypt quickly) and the religious practice of eating unleavened bread by the Israelites. It accurately reflects the understanding of this event within a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's instructions in the Bible. However, it could have further elaborated on how this event is significant in shaping the religious practices of Christianity, such as the symbolism of unleavened bread in the celebration of the Last Supper by Christians.
