## [Answer](../Historical_Context.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic understanding, the concept of a 'remnant' or a group of righteous believers who are preserved by Allah and continue to uphold the faith during times of adversity can be seen in the story of Prophet Nuh (Noah) in the Quran. According to Islamic tradition, Nuh faced great opposition and disbelief from his people, but he remained steadfast in his faith and continued to call them to believe in Allah.

Allah commanded Nuh to build an ark and warned him of a great flood that would destroy all those who rejected his message. Only a few believers, including his family members, accepted his call and believed in him. These believers were the 'remnant' who were saved by Allah's mercy and were the ones who continued the faith after the flood had wiped out the disbelievers.

Similarly, in the story of Prophet Musa (Moses), we see the concept of a 'remnant' when he and his followers were oppressed by Pharaoh and his army. Despite facing persecution and hardship, Musa and his followers remained firm in their faith and were eventually saved by Allah's miraculous intervention. They were the 'remnant' who continued to uphold the faith and worship Allah, even in the face of adversity.

Overall, the concept of a 'remnant' in Islamic teachings emphasizes the importance of maintaining faith and righteousness, even in the most challenging of circumstances. It serves as a reminder to believers to stay steadfast in their beliefs and to trust in Allah's promise of protection and guidance for those who remain true to their faith.
