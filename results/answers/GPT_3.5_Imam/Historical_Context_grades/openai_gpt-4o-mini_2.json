It effectively illustrates how a faithful group is preserved by Allah during times of adversity. However, there could have been a clearer connection made between the provided response about Isaiah and Amos and the Islamic perspective on the 'remnant' concept. More explicit integration of the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises would further enhance the overall coherence of the response."
