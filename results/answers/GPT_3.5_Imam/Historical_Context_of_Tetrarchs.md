The division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies had significant impacts on the Jewish people, particularly in the region of Judea and Galilee. The division resulted in political fragmentation and instability, which ultimately weakened Jewish autonomy and sovereignty in the region.

Furthermore, the division of the kingdom into tetrarchies also resulted in rivalries and conflicts between the different rulers, which further destabilized the region and created opportunities for external powers to exert influence over Jewish affairs.
