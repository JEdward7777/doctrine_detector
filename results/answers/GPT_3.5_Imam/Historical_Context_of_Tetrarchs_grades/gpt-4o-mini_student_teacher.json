  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies on the Jewish people. They have effectively discussed the political fragmentation, weakening of autonomy, and conflicts arising from the different rulers. However, the student could have further emphasized the specific impact on Jewish governance, culture, and relations with the Roman authorities as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response with room for minor improvement."
