  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the impact of the Roman practice of crucifixion on the perception of the cross in early Christianity. They effectively explained how the cross transitioned from a symbol of suffering and shame to one of hope, redemption, and eternal life for Christians. The student's explanation was detailed and well-supported, showcasing a strong grasp of the Christian perspective on the transformation of the cross. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention the significance of Jesus' resurrection in the transformation of the cross, as highlighted in the reference answer."
