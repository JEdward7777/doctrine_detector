  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response largely aligns with the given answer, correctly identifying the Roman practice of crucifixion as the initial source of shame and suffering associated with the cross, and accurately describing how early Christianity transformed it into a symbol of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection. The response also provides some historical context for why the cross became a central symbol of faith for Christians.\n\nHowever, to receive a higher grade, I would have liked to see more specific examples or biblical references to support this transformation, as well as a deeper exploration of what this means for the Christian message and its implications for daily life. Additionally, while the response touches on the idea that Jesus' resurrection is central to this transformation, it could be further developed.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good overview of the topic and demonstrates a good understanding of the transformation of the cross's symbolism in early Christianity."
