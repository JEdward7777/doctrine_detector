  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a good overview of the individuals who built altars in the Bible and their significance. The student effectively highlights examples such as Prophet Ibrahim and Prophet Noah, along with their reasons for building altars. The explanation of the significance of altars in showing reverence, submission to God, and offering prayers and sacrifices is accurate. The comparison with Islamic practices related to worship is informative. However, to improve the response, the student could have delved deeper into the theological significance of altars in the Bible, such as the foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the cross."
