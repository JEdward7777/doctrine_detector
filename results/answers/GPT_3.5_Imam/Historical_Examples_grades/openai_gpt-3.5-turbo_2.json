It also acknowledges the significance of these acts of worship in inspiring Christians to express their own faith and devotion through intentional acts of worship. The response could have further emphasized the transformative nature of building altars in deepening one's relationship with God, but overall, it provides a strong and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview."
