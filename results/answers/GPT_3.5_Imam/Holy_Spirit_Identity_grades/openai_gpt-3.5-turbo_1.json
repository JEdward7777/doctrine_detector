The engagement with the concern is appropriate, highlighting the importance of recognizing the divine nature of the Holy Spirit for Christians to fully benefit from his guidance and support. However, a more explicit connection between the understanding of the Holy Spirit's divine nature and the impact on Christians' engagement with his guidance could have been made to strengthen the response further."
