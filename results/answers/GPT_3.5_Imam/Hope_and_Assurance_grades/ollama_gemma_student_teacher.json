  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of having no hope according to biblical references and provides a nuanced analysis of the concept within both Islamic and Christian contexts. It clearly explains the idea of hope as an expectation of good and emphasizes the importance of balance between hope and fear. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific biblical references or passages that support the claim regarding the significance of having no hope."
