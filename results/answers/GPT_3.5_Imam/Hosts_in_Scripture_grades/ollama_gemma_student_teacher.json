  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a limited understanding of the term \"hosts\" in scripture from a Christian perspective. While it correctly identifies some contexts in which the term is used in Islamic scripture, it fails to address the Christian understanding of the term. The response lacks clarity and fails to provide a comprehensive explanation of the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority as requested in the concern."
