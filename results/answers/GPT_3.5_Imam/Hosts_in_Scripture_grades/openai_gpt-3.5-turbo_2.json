The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept within an Islamic context. However, from a Christian perspective, the explanation lacks the emphasis on the ultimate authority and sovereignty of God over all spiritual beings and forces, which is crucial in understanding spiritual warfare and prayer. Incorporating more on God's supreme power and His victory in spiritual battles would have enhanced the response further."
