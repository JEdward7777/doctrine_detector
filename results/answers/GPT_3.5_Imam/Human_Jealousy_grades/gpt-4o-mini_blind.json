  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 85.\n\nWhile the response provides a comprehensive view on addressing feelings of jealousy in relationships from an Islamic perspective, it lacks emphasis on repentance and seeking forgiveness from Allah for harboring jealousy.

Overall, the answer provides valuable insights on managing jealousy within the framework of Islamic teachings."
