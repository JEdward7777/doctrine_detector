  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response from an Islamic perspective on addressing feelings of jealousy in relationships. The mention of open communication, trust in Allah's plan, gratitude, and seeking guidance from Islamic teachings are all valid approaches to addressing jealousy. However, the student's answer focused more on managing jealousy through faith and communication, rather than directly evaluating the impact of jealousy on personal relationships. It would have been beneficial for the student to further emphasize the importance of evaluating the root causes of jealousy within relationships and addressing any underlying issues to prevent harm."
