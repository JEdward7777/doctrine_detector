However, the focus should be specifically on the Christian perspective. The student correctly mentions the belief in Jesus Christ as the Savior and His sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, which is foundational in Christian theology. However, the explanation could be more detailed and focused solely on the Christian understanding of righteousness without delving into Islamic beliefs. Additionally, the student could have emphasized the concept of justification by faith in Christ as central to Christian righteousness."
