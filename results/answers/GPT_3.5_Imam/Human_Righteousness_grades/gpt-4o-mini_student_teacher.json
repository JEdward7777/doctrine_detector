  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comparison of righteousness between Islam and Christianity but fails to directly address the specific concern of clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus. The student does briefly touch on the association of righteousness with belief in Jesus and acceptance of His sacrifice in Christianity but does not clearly explain that righteousness in Christian faith is attained through faith in Jesus as Savior and acceptance of His sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, as outlined in the reference answer. The response lacks focus and depth in addressing the concern effectively."
