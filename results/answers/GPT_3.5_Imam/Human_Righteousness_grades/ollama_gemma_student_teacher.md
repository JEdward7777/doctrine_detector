## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, righteousness is achieved through faith in Allah, following His commandments, and striving to do good deeds. In Christianity, righteousness is often associated with the belief in Jesus Christ as the Savior and the acceptance of His sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.

However, from an Islamic perspective, righteousness in Christianity is achieved through faith in Jesus and acceptance of His sacrifice, which is fundamentally different from the Islamic belief in the oneness of Allah and the importance of following His guidance through the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Quran.

In Islam, righteousness is a comprehensive concept that encompasses belief in Allah, performing good deeds, obeying His commandments, and treating others with kindness and compassion. It is a continuous effort to improve oneself spiritually and morally. Ultimately, righteousness in Islam is attained through sincere faith, righteous actions, and seeking forgiveness for any shortcomings.
