  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThis response does attempt to clarify the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus, but it falls short in several areas. While it correctly identifies trust in Jesus as essential for human righteousness, it does not fully address the concern of clarifying the basis for human righteousness.\n\nThe response primarily focuses on the Islamic perspective and views righteousness as a comprehensive concept that encompasses various aspects, such as belief, good deeds, and treatment of others with kindness and compassion. While this is an important aspect of Islamic teachings, it does not directly address the concern of clarifying the basis for human righteousness in relation to faith in Jesus.\n\nFurthermore, the response does not adequately explain how a person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesus\u2019 righteousness to them. This is an important aspect of Christian theology that requires further clarification.\n\nOverall, while this response attempts to address the concern of clarifying the basis for human righteousness, it does not fully succeed in doing so. Therefore, I would give it a grade of 60."
