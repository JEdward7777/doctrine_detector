  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of righteousness in Christianity as being associated with faith in Jesus and acceptance of His sacrifice for forgiveness of sins, which aligns well with the provided answer. However, the concern raised about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is not directly addressed in the response. The response could be improved by explicitly connecting the explanation of righteousness in Christianity to the significance of faith in Jesus for understanding salvation."
