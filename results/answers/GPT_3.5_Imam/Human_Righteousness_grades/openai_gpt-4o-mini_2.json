However, the discussion lacks a deeper exploration of the specific concerns raised in relation to the Islamic perspective on righteousness and faith in Allah. While the response does touch on the contrast between the two faith traditions, it could have been more direct in addressing how the basis for human righteousness in Christianity differs from Islam in light of the provided concern. Further elaboration on the significance of faith in Jesus for salvation and its contrast with Islamic beliefs would have strengthened the response."
