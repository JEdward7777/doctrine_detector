When God says, "I have called you by name," it signifies a deep and personal connection between the individual and their Creator. In the Islamic context, this can be understood as a recognition and acknowledgment by Allah of each person as a unique and valued creation.

This phrase emphasizes the intimacy of the relationship between the individual and God, highlighting the idea that God is aware of each person on a personal level. It conveys the idea that God knows us individually, cares for us deeply, and calls us to a relationship of love and guidance.

This concept can bring comfort and reassurance to believers, as it reminds them that they are not alone in their journey through life. It serves as a reminder that God is always present, always watching over them, and always calling them towards what is good and beneficial for their spiritual growth and well-being.
