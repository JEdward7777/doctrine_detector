When God says, "I have called you by name," it signifies a deep and personal connection between the individual and their Creator. In the Islamic context, this can be understood as a recognition and acknowledgment by Allah of each person as a unique and valued creation.

This phrase emphasizes the intimacy of the relationship between the individual and God, highlighting the idea that God is aware of each person on a personal level. It conveys the idea that God knows us individually, cares for us deeply, and calls us to a relationship of love and guidance.

This concept can bring comfort and reassurance to believers, as it reminds them that they are not alone in their journey through life.
