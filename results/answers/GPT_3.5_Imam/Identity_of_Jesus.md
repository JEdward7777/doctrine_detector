## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, Jesus (known as 'Isa' in Arabic) is a highly revered prophet and messenger of Allah. The name 'Jesus' signifies a noble and esteemed figure in Islamic teachings who was sent by Allah to guide the Children of Israel and preach the message of monotheism, righteousness, and compassion.

Jesus' purpose, according to Islamic belief, was to call people to worship and obey Allah alone, to establish justice and righteousness, and to deliver the message of the coming of the final prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muslims believe that Jesus performed miracles by the will of Allah, including healing the sick, raising the dead, and speaking as a baby in the cradle, all as signs of his prophethood and to demonstrate the power of Allah.

Ultimately, Jesus' purpose aligns with the broader message of all prophets in Islam, which is to call people to worship Allah sincerely and to live righteous lives in accordance with His guidance. Muslims hold Jesus in high regard and believe in his miraculous birth to the Virgin Mary, as mentioned in the Quran. However, it is important to note that Islam differs from Christianity in its understanding of Jesus as a prophet and messenger rather than the literal son of God or part of a Trinity.
