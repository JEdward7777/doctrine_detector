However, from a Christian worldview, it is essential to note that Jesus' purpose as understood in Christianity is fundamentally different. The response could have touched upon Jesus' role as the Son of God, his sacrificial death for the redemption of sin, his resurrection, and his future return as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Bringing in these central Christian doctrines would have provided a more holistic understanding of the significance of the name 'Jesus' in Christianity."
