  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and informative response regarding the Islamic perspective on Jesus, known as 'Isa' in Arabic. However, the answer focused predominantly on Islamic beliefs and teachings rather than addressing the specific concern of understanding Jesus's name and role as Savior from a Christian worldview. The response lacked an explicit connection to the significance of Jesus's name and purpose in relation to saving people from their sins, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. It is important for the student to consider the specific viewpoint and beliefs of Christianity in responding to questions related to Jesus."
