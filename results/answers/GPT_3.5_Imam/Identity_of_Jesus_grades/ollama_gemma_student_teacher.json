While it focuses on Islamic beliefs rather than Christian beliefs, it correctly highlights the idea that the name 'Jesus' signifies salvation. However, the answer would benefit from further elaboration on the Christian understanding of Jesus' purpose as the Son of God and the significance of his sacrifice for sin."
