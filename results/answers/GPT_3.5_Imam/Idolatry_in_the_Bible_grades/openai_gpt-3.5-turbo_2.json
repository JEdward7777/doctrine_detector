It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the seriousness of straying from God's commandments and emphasizes the importance of monotheism. The only minor improvement would be to include a brief mention of the importance of repentance and returning to God after committing idolatry, as this is a key aspect emphasized in the Bible."
