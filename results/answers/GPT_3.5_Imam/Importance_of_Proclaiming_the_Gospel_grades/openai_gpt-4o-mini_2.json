  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of why it is important for Christians to proclaim the 'good news' based on Jesus' instruction to share the message of salvation. It correctly recognizes the mandate of Christians to spread the Gospel message before Jesus's return to heaven. The Christian perspective is effectively highlighted, and the relevance of obeying Jesus' command is well addressed. The response could have further elaborated on the theological significance of salvation through Jesus Christ as the core message of the 'good news', but overall, it effectively addresses the concern within a Christian worldview."
