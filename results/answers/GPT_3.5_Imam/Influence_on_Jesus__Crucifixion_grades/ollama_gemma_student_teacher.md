## [Answer](../Influence_on_Jesus__Crucifixion.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe in Jesus (Isa) as a Prophet of God, born to the Virgin Mary (Maryam) and not crucified but raised to Heaven by God. However, referencing the Christian narrative for the purpose of your question, the role of the Sadducees and Pharisees in the decision to crucify Jesus is portrayed in the Bible.

The Pharisees and Sadducees, both groups within the Jewish religious leadership at the time, held different beliefs and practices. The Pharisees focused on strict adherence to religious laws and traditions, while the Sadducees were more aligned with the ruling elites and did not believe in the resurrection of the dead or in angels. 

According to the New Testament narrative, the Pharisees and Sadducees collaborated with Roman authorities to have Jesus arrested and sentenced to crucifixion. The Pharisees were threatened by Jesus' teachings and popularity among the people, as he challenged their authority and interpretation of the scriptures. The Sadducees were also concerned about maintaining peace with the Roman Empire and saw Jesus as a potential revolutionary figure who could disrupt the status quo.

Their decision to have Jesus crucified reveals aspects of their character such as envy, pride, and a desire to protect their own power and influence. They were willing to go to great lengths, including collaborating with a foreign occupying power, to eliminate a perceived threat to their authority.

In Islam, Jesus is revered as a Prophet of God and is not condemned to death on the cross. As Muslims, we believe in the purity and righteousness of the Prophets, including Jesus, and reject the notion that he was crucified.
