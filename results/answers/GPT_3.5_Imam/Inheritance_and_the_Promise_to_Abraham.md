## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, God promised Abraham (Ibrahim) and his descendants that they would inherit and inhabit the land of Canaan. This promise is mentioned in the Quran in several verses, one of which is in Surah Al-Anbiya (Chapter 21), verse 71, where it is stated:

"And We made them leaders guiding by Our command. And We inspired to them the doing of good deeds, establishment of prayer, and giving of Zakah; and they were worshippers of Us." (Quran 21:73)

God's promise to Abraham and his descendants is seen as a fulfillment of this prophecy, and Muslims believe that the land of Canaan (which includes modern-day Palestine) is an integral part of the inheritance promised to the descendants of Abraham.
