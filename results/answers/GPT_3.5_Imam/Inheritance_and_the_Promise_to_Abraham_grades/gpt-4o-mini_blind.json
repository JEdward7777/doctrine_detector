  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response is incorrect from a Christian perspective. In the Bible, God promised Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession (Genesis 17:8). The answer does not align with Christian doctrine regarding the specific covenant God made with Abraham and his descendants in relation to the land. Clarifying the biblical perspective and the unique nature of God's covenant with Abraham would improve the accuracy and theological alignment of the response."
