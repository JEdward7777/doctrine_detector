It acknowledges the eternal nature of this promise. However, there is room for improvement in linking this covenant to its implications for believers in terms of their faith, obedience, and relationship with God. A deeper exploration of how this covenant shapes the beliefs and actions of followers would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
