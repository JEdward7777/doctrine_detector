## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, my response is based on Islamic teachings and not on the Bible. In Islam, the concept of inheriting eternal life is understood through the belief in the Hereafter and the Day of Judgment. Muslims believe that in order to attain eternal life in paradise, one must have faith in one God (Allah) and do righteous deeds according to the teachings of Islam.

Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of belief in the Oneness of Allah, following the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), performing acts of worship (such as prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage), and treating others with kindness and compassion.

Ultimately, the Quran teaches that faith and good deeds are necessary for attaining eternal life in Paradise. Allah says in the Quran, "But those who believe and do righteous deeds - for them are the Gardens of Pleasure" (Quran 31:8).
