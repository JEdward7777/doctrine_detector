  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 30.\n\nWhile the response does discuss the concept of inheriting eternal life, it does not directly address the concern of clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. The response is primarily focused on Islamic teachings and the beliefs of Muslims regarding eternal life, which are different from those found in Christianity. The quote from the Quran also reinforces this difference.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge the importance of faith and good deeds for attaining eternal life, it does not provide a clear understanding of the Christian concept of salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. As such, I would give this response a relatively low grade."
