  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the student's response acknowledges the presence of injustice in the world and suggests both Christians and Muslims should work together to combat it, the answer is primarily focused on Islamic teachings and actions. The student fails to provide a distinctly Christian perspective on addressing injustice, which is essential for this prompt. Additionally, the student does not delve into specific biblical principles or teachings that guide Christian responses to injustice. The answer could have been improved by emphasizing Christian beliefs such as seeking justice, loving kindness, and walking humbly with God, as outlined in Micah 6:8, and highlighting examples of how Jesus addressed injustice during His ministry on earth."
