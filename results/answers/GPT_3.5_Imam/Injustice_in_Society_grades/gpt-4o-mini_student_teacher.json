  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 30. While the student did address examples of injustice and suggested actions to combat them, the answer heavily focuses on Islamic teachings rather than addressing the need for Christian activism against injustice specifically from a Christian worldview. The response lacks a clear emphasis on promoting fairness based on biblical principles and how Christians should uniquely engage with issues of injustice. It is important for the student to understand the specific Christian perspective when addressing questions related to Christian activism."
