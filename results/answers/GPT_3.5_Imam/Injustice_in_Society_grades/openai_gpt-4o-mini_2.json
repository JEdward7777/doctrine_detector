It also highlights the importance of promoting fairness based on biblical principles. However, the response could have provided more specific examples of how Christians can actively engage in activism against injustice while grounding it in Christian teachings. Additionally, more emphasis on the biblical foundation for promoting fairness and justice would have strengthened the response."
