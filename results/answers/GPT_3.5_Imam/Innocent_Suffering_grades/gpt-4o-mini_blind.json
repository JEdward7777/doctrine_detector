  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has effectively explained the concept of 'innocent blood' in the Bible by referencing relevant passages and highlighting its significance as something sacred and abhorred by God. They correctly linked the shedding of innocent blood to the value of life as emphasized in the belief of humans being made in the image of God. The response is doctrinally sound and provides a clear explanation with appropriate scriptural references."
