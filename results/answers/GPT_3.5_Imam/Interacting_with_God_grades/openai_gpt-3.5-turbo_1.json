While the response stayed within the Islamic worldview, it did not fully address the concern about how Christians may question the influence of their choices on their relationship with God and His plans. It would have been beneficial to acknowledge the Christian perspective and draw parallels or contrasts between the two faith traditions in addressing this concern."
