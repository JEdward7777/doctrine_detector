  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a generally accurate explanation of \"the last day\" in Christian teaching, mentioning the return of Jesus Christ for final judgment based on biblical passages. However, the student mixes in references to Islamic beliefs, which may create confusion and detract from the clarity of the Christian perspective. Additionally, the emphasis on actions and righteousness without mentioning the need for faith in Jesus Christ as Savior could weaken the understanding of the urgency of faith in the context of judgment according to a Christian worldview."
