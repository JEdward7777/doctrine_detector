It is important to emphasize the need for individuals to recognize the seriousness of judgment and the impact it has on their eternal destiny, prompting a sense of urgency in cultivating a faithful relationship with God. More emphasis on personal accountability and the need for repentance and faith in Christ would enhance the response."
