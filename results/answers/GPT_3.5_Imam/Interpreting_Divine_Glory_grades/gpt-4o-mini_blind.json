  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a decent explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the concept of \"divine glory\" in worship. However, the answer lacks depth in theological understanding and does not address the perspective of divine glory from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student could have delved into the biblical understanding of divine glory in the context of Christian worship, emphasizing aspects such as the holiness, majesty, and transcendence of God, as well as the significant role of Jesus Christ in the revelation of God's glory."
