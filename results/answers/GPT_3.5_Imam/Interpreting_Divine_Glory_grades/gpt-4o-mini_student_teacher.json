  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation of how the concept of \"divine glory\" is understood in Islam and how it influences worship practices. However, the response did not specifically address the concern provided regarding recognizing God's glory in worship practices from a Christian worldview. The student mentioned the attributes of Allah and the importance of sincerity in worship, but did not directly relate this to the Christian concept of divine glory. The response would have been stronger if it had integrated Christian beliefs and practices related to divine glory into the explanation."
