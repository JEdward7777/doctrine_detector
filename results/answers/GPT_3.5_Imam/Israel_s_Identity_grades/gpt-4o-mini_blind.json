The student effectively mentions the story of Jacob's renaming in Genesis and its meaning, as well as the broader theological implications of the name for the Israelites as God's chosen people. The answer could have been enhanced by citing specific Bible verses or providing more detailed examples of the struggles and faith of the Israelites throughout the Old Testament. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could benefit from further depth and specificity in biblical references."
