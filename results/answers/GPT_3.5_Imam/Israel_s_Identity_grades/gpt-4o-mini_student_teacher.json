  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of the name 'Israel' in its biblical origin, connecting it to the story of Jacob wrestling with an angel and the renaming by God. The student also highlights the importance of the name in representing the relationship between God and His chosen people. However, the answer could have been improved by directly stating that \"Israel\" means \"He struggles with God\" and focusing more on the specific biblical context of the name without additional interpretations."
