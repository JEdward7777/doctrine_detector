In the context of its biblical origin, the name 'Israel' holds deep significance. It is derived from the story in the Book of Genesis where Jacob wrestles with an angel and is renamed "Israel", meaning "one who struggles with God" or "God strives". This renaming signifies a transformation in Jacob's character and emphasizes his perseverance in faith despite facing challenges and struggles.

The name 'Israel' is also associated with the descendants of Jacob, who are referred to as the Israelites. In the Bible, the term 'Israel' is often used to refer to both the ancient kingdom of Israel and the larger community of the descendants of Jacob. The Israelites are seen as God's chosen people, with whom God establishes a covenant and promises blessings and protection in exchange for their obedience and worship.

Overall, the name 'Israel' in a biblical context symbolizes struggle, faith, and the special relationship between God and His chosen people.
