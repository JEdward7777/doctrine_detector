It is derived from the story in the Book of Genesis where Jacob wrestles with an angel and is renamed "Israel", meaning "one who struggles with God" or "God strives". This renaming signifies a transformation in Jacob's character and emphasizes his perseverance in faith despite facing challenges and struggles.

The Israelites are seen as God's chosen people, with whom God establishes a covenant and promises blessings and protection in exchange for their obedience and worship.
