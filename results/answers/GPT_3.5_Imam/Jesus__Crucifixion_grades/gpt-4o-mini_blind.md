## Question [Jesus’ Crucifixion](../../../questions/Jesus__Crucifixion.md)
What does the offer of wine mixed with myrrh indicate about Jesus' experience on the cross?

## Correct Answer
The offer of wine mixed with myrrh was meant to ease Jesus' pain and suffering, yet he refused it, reflecting his full acceptance of his sacrificial role.

## Stated Concern
Reflecting on Jesus' refusal can lead to deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Crucifixion.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was not crucified but was raised up to the heavens by Allah. The Quran mentions in Surah An-Nisa (4:157-158) that Jesus was not killed nor was he crucified, but it was made to appear so to the people. So, we do not believe that Jesus actually experienced being crucified on the cross.

Therefore, any references to wine mixed with myrrh in relation to Jesus' experience on the cross are not considered relevant from an Islamic perspective.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
30.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 30/100

Comment: The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus not being crucified. However, since the question pertains specifically to Jesus' experience on the cross from a Christian perspective, this response does not engage with the topic at hand. From a Christian worldview, the offer of wine mixed with myrrh indicates the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and symbolizes aspects such as suffering, sacrifice, and the humanity of Jesus during his crucifixion. More focus on addressing the question from a Christian viewpoint would have resulted in a higher grade.
