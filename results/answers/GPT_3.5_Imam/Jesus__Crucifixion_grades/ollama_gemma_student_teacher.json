  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 60/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of Islamic teachings regarding the crucifixion of Jesus. However, it lacks engagement with the Christian specific worldview and the concern expressed in the prompt. The response does not address the significance of Jesus' refusal of wine and myrrh within the Christian understanding of his suffering and sacrifice. Additionally, the answer is somewhat dismissive of the relevance of the offering to Jesus' experience on the cross."
