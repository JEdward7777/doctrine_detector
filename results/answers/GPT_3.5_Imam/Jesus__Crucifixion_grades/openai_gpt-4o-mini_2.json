However, the Islamic perspective provided in the original response, while valid within the context of Islamic beliefs, may raise some theological conflicts from a Christian worldview as the belief in Jesus' crucifixion is central to Christian faith. It's important to recognize the differences in beliefs between Christianity and Islam in relation to Jesus' crucifixion when discussing such theological topics."
