In Islamic belief, Jesus (peace be upon him) is considered a mighty prophet of Allah. When Jesus said, "I am the Resurrection and the Life" in the Christian scriptures, it is understood to mean that through him, believers can attain spiritual rebirth and everlasting life. This statement emphasizes Jesus's role in providing salvation and eternal life to those who believe in him. Muslims respect Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, and while we may not interpret this statement in the same way as Christians do, we acknowledge the importance of Jesus's teachings in guiding believers towards righteousness and the Hereafter.
