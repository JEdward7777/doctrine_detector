  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The answer does not align with a Christian worldview as it presents a perspective that relativizes the uniqueness of Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the central figure for salvation. It is important to emphasize Jesus's divinity and the significance of his statement in relation to his role as the source of resurrection and eternal life for believers. The answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on Christian doctrine and the belief in Jesus as the only way to salvation."
