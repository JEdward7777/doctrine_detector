  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 70.\n\nThe response does acknowledge Jesus' importance in providing salvation and eternal life, which aligns with the concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. However, it also strays from the correct understanding by suggesting that Jesus is only the source of physical resurrection, rather than emphasizing his divinity and spiritual significance as the Resurrection and the Life.\n\nThe response's attempt to acknowledge the importance of Jesus' teachings in guiding believers towards righteousness and the Hereafter is a positive aspect, but it could be strengthened by providing more biblical support for this claim. Overall, while the response shows some understanding of Jesus' role, it could be improved by a more nuanced and biblically-grounded explanation.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates some recognition of Jesus' significance in resurrection, but could benefit from a more accurate and detailed explanation of his identity and role."
