  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately discusses Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" in a Christian context and acknowledges the significance of Jesus in providing salvation. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection for faith and theological understanding. The only minor critique is that it could have elaborated more on the unique Christian belief regarding Jesus as the source of resurrection. Overall, a solid response with a strong Christian worldview perspective."
