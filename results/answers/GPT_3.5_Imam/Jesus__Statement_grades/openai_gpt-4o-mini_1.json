However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern by not explicitly stating Jesus as the source of resurrection and the one who causes people to come back to life, as highlighted in the given answer. The response does well in highlighting the differing interpretations between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus, but could have emphasized more on the unique Christian understanding of Jesus as the central figure in the resurrection."
