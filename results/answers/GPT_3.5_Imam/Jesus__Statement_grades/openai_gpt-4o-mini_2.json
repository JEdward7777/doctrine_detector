  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided an accurate Islamic perspective on Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, acknowledging his importance in guiding believers towards righteousness and the Hereafter. However, the response did not directly address the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the response could have highlighted Jesus' divinity and unique role as the Savior who offers redemption and eternal life through his resurrection."
