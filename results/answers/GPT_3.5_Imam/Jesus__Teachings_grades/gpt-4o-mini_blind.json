The focus on Islamic tradition and Prophet Isa is not relevant to the question. A doctrinally correct answer would have explored how \"amen\" was used by Jesus in the context of His teachings in the Bible and its significance within Christianity. The response does not align with a Christian worldview in addressing the question asked."
