  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response about Jesus in Islamic tradition, emphasizing the core teachings shared by prophets, including Jesus. However, the answer did not directly address the question about Jesus using the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings from a Christian worldview. The student's response did not demonstrate an understanding of the specific concern regarding recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture."
