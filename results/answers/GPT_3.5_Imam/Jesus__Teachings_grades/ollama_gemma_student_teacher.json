  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a limited understanding of the Christian perspective on Jesus' use of the term \"amen.\" While it acknowledges the significance of Jesus' teachings in Islamic tradition, the response lacks specific examples or references from Christian scriptures to support the claim that Jesus used \"amen\" to emphasize his teachings. The answer also fails to address the concern related to recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture."
