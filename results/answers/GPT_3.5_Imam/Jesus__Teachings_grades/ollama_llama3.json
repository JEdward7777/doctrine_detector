  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response does provide some insight into Islamic views on Jesus and his teachings, which is relevant to recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. However, it does not directly address the concern or engage with the specific description provided about Jesus' use of the term \"amen\". The response tends to focus more on general Islamic beliefs and practices rather than specifically exploring how Jesus' teachings were authoritative in a Christian context. To improve the grade, the response could have more explicitly connected Jesus' teachings and authority to Christian Scripture and doctrine."
