However, it lacks a direct reference to the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, which is a key concern in recognizing the significance of His teachings from a Christian worldview. The response could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the authority of Jesus' words to Scripture in order to fully address the concern from a Christian perspective."
