  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how Jesus's teachings were emphasized in the Islamic tradition, specifically regarding the term \"Amen.\" However, the concern specified the importance of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, which is not fully addressed in the response. While the explanation of how Jesus's messages were emphasized is informative, it lacks a direct connection to acknowledging the divine authority of Jesus as portrayed in Scripture from a Christian worldview. A stronger integration of this aspect would improve the grade."
