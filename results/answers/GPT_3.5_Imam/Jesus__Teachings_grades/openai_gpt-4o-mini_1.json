  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the term \"amen\" in the context of Jesus' teachings within Islamic tradition. However, it lacks a direct acknowledgment of the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, which is a key concern from a Christian perspective. To improve the grade, the response could have included a clearer recognition of Jesus' authority as the Son of God and the importance of His teachings as revealed in the Bible."
