It also acknowledges the differences in the concept of priesthood between Christianity and Islam. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the Islamic perspective on sacrifice and atonement, specifically addressing how it relates to Jesus' role. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly stating how Jesus' sacrifice renders human priestly sacrifices obsolete from a Christian standpoint."
