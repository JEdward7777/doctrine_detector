It highlights the differences in beliefs regarding priesthood and sacrifice between Christianity and Islam. However, the response could have further explored the significance of Jesus' role in priesthood within the Christian belief system and emphasized the unique theological aspects of Jesus as the ultimate mediator between humanity and God."
