It effectively connects Jesus as the Great High Priest who offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity. The response also highlights Jesus' eternal priesthood, authority, and his role as the mediator between humanity and God. Great job in addressing the given concerns from a Christian worldview."
