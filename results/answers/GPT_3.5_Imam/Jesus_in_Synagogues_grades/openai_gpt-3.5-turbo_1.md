Jesus is recognized as a prophet in Islam, and His interactions with the synagogue during His ministry are also mentioned in the Quran. In Islamic tradition, Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) is depicted as preaching and teaching in the synagogues among the Children of Israel.

The Quran mentions that Jesus confirmed the teachings of the Torah and brought guidance and wisdom to the Children of Israel. He is described as a messenger sent by Allah to guide people towards righteousness and truth.

Overall, Prophet Jesus' interactions with the synagogue during His ministry were characterized by His preaching, teaching, and calling people to worship Allah alone and follow His commandments. His message emphasized love, compassion, and mercy towards others, as well as the importance of faith, repentance, and submission to the will of Allah.

It's important to note that while there may be differences in the specific details of Jesus' interactions with the synagogue between Islamic and Christian traditions, both emphasize His role as a spiritual guide and teacher who sought to lead people towards faith and righteousness.
