However, it does not fully address the concern of recognizing the significance of Jesus' actions in synagogues as part of His ministry and teaching per the Christian worldview. The response could be enhanced by incorporating how Jesus' teachings in synagogues were central to His mission of salvation and reconciliation with God, as seen in the Christian faith."
