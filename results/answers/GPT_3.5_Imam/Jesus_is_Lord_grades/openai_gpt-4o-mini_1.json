  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively communicates the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles by emphasizing His authority and supremacy over all creation. The explanation given aligns well with the Christian worldview, highlighting the unique and divine nature of Jesus as Lord. However, the response could have been improved by explicitly stating that the political connotations of the title \"Lord\" should not diminish the sacred significance of Jesus' lordship. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concern provided."
