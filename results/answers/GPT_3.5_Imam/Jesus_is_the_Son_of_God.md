## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Target answer from notes
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Concern to grade by
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) is a prophet and a messenger of Allah, and he is not considered the literal son of God. Rather, we believe in the Oneness of God, known as Tawhid, which is a fundamental concept in Islam.

Therefore, a more appropriate translation in a Muslim context would be to say: "Isa (Jesus) is a prophet and servant of Allah." This aligns with the Islamic belief in the prophethood of Jesus and his special status as a chosen messenger of Allah.
