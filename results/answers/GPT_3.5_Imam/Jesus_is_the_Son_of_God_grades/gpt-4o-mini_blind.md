## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## [Answer](../Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) is a prophet and a messenger of Allah, and he is not considered the literal son of God. Rather, we believe in the Oneness of God, known as Tawhid, which is a fundamental concept in Islam.

Therefore, a more appropriate translation in a Muslim context would be to say: "Isa (Jesus) is a prophet and servant of Allah." This aligns with the Islamic belief in the prophethood of Jesus and his special status as a chosen messenger of Allah.

Comment: The answer accurately conveys the difference in beliefs between Christianity and Islam regarding the divinity of Jesus. However, it could have further elaborated on Jesus' unique status as a prophet in Islam, emphasizing his miraculous birth and his return in the future according to Islamic teachings. Additionally, the response could have touched upon the concept of Shirk (associating partners with Allah) in Islam, which is why Muslims do not believe in Jesus as the literal Son of God.
