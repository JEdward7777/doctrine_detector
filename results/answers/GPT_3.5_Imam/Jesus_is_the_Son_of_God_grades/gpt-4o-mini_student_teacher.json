  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer acknowledges the difference in belief between Christianity and Islam regarding Jesus as the Son of God. However, the answer falls short in accurately translating the phrase \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context as instructed by the teacher. The student's response suggests a different translation that aligns with Islamic beliefs but does not maintain the original terminology provided in the question. It is important to accurately represent the original text while also providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning, as directed by the teacher."
