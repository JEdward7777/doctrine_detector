## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## [Answer](../Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) is a prophet and a messenger of Allah, and he is not considered the literal son of God. Rather, we believe in the Oneness of God, known as Tawhid, which is a fundamental concept in Islam.

Therefore, a more appropriate translation in a Muslim context would be to say: "Isa (Jesus) is a prophet and servant of Allah." This aligns with the Islamic belief in the prophethood of Jesus and his special status as a chosen messenger of Allah.

## Grade: 80

**Comment:** This is a good attempt at translating the statement "Jesus is the Son of God" into a Muslim context. It acknowledges the Islamic belief in Jesus as a prophet and messenger of Allah, while avoiding literal claims of divinity. The explanation of Tawhid reinforces the Islamic understanding of God's oneness, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it could benefit from further elaboration on the relationship between Jesus and Allah, as well as the significance of his role as a Son in the Christian faith.
