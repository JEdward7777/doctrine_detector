  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus and provided an appropriate alternative translation within that context. However, from a Christian-specific worldview, the response did not maintain the original terminology or convey the concept of Jesus being the Son of God as Biblically accurate. There was no clear teaching or context provided to explain the meaning in line with Christian beliefs. The grade reflects the need for better alignment with the concern of maintaining Biblical accuracy and explaining the meaning appropriately."
