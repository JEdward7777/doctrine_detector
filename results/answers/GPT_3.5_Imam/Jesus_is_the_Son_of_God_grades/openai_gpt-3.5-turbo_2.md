## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## [Answer](../Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) is a prophet and a messenger of Allah, and he is not considered the literal son of God. Rather, we believe in the Oneness of God, known as Tawhid, which is a fundamental concept in Islam.

Therefore, a more appropriate translation in a Muslim context would be to say: "Isa (Jesus) is a prophet and servant of Allah." This aligns with the Islamic belief in the prophethood of Jesus and his special status as a chosen messenger of Allah.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The response provided a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus and provided an appropriate alternative translation within that context. However, from a Christian-specific worldview, the response did not maintain the original terminology or convey the concept of Jesus being the Son of God as Biblically accurate. There was no clear teaching or context provided to explain the meaning in line with Christian beliefs. The grade reflects the need for better alignment with the concern of maintaining Biblical accuracy and explaining the meaning appropriately.
