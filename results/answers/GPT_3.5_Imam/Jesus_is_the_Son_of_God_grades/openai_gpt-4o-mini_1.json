However, from a Christian worldview, the response does not address the concern of maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain the meaning of \"Jesus is the Son of God.\" It misses the opportunity to acknowledge and explain the significance of Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity."
