  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus (peace be upon him) and offers an alternative translation that aligns with Islamic beliefs. However, from a Christian perspective, the response does not address the concern of maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain the meaning of \"Jesus is the Son of God.\" Therefore, while the response is informative and respectful, it lacks in addressing the specific concern given and hence the grade is slightly reduced."
