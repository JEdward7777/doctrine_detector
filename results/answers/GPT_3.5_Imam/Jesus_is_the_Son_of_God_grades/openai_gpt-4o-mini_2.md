## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## [Answer](../Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) is a prophet and a messenger of Allah, and he is not considered the literal son of God. Rather, we believe in the Oneness of God, known as Tawhid, which is a fundamental concept in Islam.

Therefore, a more appropriate translation in a Muslim context would be to say: "Isa (Jesus) is a prophet and servant of Allah." This aligns with the Islamic belief in the prophethood of Jesus and his special status as a chosen messenger of Allah.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus (peace be upon him) and offers an alternative translation that aligns with Islamic beliefs. However, from a Christian perspective, the response does not address the concern of maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain the meaning of "Jesus is the Son of God." Therefore, while the response is informative and respectful, it lacks in addressing the specific concern given and hence the grade is slightly reduced.
