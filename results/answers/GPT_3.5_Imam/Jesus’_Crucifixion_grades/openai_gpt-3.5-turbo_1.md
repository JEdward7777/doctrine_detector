# Question [Jesus’ Crucifixion](../../../questions/Jesus’_Crucifixion.md)
What does the offer of wine mixed with myrrh indicate about Jesus' experience on the cross?

# Correct Answer
The offer of wine mixed with myrrh was meant to ease Jesus' pain and suffering, yet he refused it, reflecting his full acceptance of his sacrificial role.

# Stated Concern
Reflecting on Jesus' refusal can lead to deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission.

# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was not crucified but was raised up to the heavens by Allah. The Quran mentions in Surah An-Nisa (4:157-158) that Jesus was not killed nor was he crucified, but it was made to appear so to the people. So, we do not believe that Jesus actually experienced being crucified on the cross.

Therefore, any references to wine mixed with myrrh in relation to Jesus' experience on the cross are not considered relevant from an Islamic perspective.

Comment: From a Christian perspective, the response given aligns with the concern provided in highlighting Jesus' refusal of wine mixed with myrrh as a demonstration of his commitment to his sacrificial role. However, the provided response does not address the concern involving Islamic teachings regarding the crucifixion of Jesus, which is a significant theological difference between Islam and Christianity. It is crucial to acknowledge and respect these differences when evaluating religious perspectives.
