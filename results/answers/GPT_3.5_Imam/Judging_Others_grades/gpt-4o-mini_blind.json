  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a well-written and insightful perspective from an Islamic point of view regarding judging others. However, as the question specifically asked for instructions from the Bible on how Christians should judge each other, the response does not directly address the biblical teachings on this matter. As a result, the grade is lower as it does not align with the Christian worldview sought in the question. The response may have benefited from directly referencing Christian scriptures on this topic."
