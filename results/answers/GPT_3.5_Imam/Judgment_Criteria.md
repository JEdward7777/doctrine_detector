## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I will provide an understanding from the Islamic perspective on how individuals will be judged on the Day of Judgment, as taught in the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

In Islam, the Day of Judgment is known as Yawm al-Qiyamah. On that day, every individual will be resurrected and brought before Allah for judgment. The Quran describes this day as a day when every individual will be recompensed for their deeds, whether good or bad.

The criteria for judgment are based on one's faith in Allah, their actions and intentions in accordance with Islamic teachings, and their treatment of others. The Quran emphasizes the importance of belief in the Oneness of Allah, following the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), performing good deeds, and avoiding sin.

On the Day of Judgment, every person's deeds will be weighed, and they will be held accountable for their actions. Those who believed in Allah and lived a righteous life will be rewarded with Paradise, while those who rejected faith and engaged in sinful activities will face punishment in Hell.

Ultimately, the judgment on the Day of Judgment is in the hands of Allah, who is the Most Just and Merciful. It is important for Muslims to strive to live a righteous life, seek forgiveness for their sins, and have faith in Allah's mercy and judgment on that day.
