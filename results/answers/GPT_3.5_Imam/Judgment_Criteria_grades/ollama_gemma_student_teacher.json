  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the Islamic perspective on the Day of Judgment, referencing relevant Islamic teachings and beliefs. However, it does not address the Christian specific worldview or the criterion of judgment based on Christ's character. The answer is relevant to the question as it explains the Islamic belief in judgment based on actions and intentions, but it does not align with the Christian perspective as specified in the concern."
