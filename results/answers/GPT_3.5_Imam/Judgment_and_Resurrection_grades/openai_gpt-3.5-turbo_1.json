While the response provides a comparison between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding judgment and accountability, it does not specifically detail the events associated with the Christian concept of the \"day of Yahweh\" or the \"day of the Lord\" as requested. It lacks specificity in explaining the judgment of sinners, resurrection, and the establishment of the Lord's rule that are key components of Christian eschatology."
