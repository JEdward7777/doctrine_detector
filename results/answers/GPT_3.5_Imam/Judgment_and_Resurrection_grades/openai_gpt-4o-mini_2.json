It effectively highlights the similarities in the events of judgment, resurrection, and accountability for actions. However, while the response addresses the events of judgment and accountability, it lacks specific details about the resurrection of believers and the establishment of God's rule, which are significant aspects of Christian eschatology. A more thorough explanation of these events would have enhanced the response further."
