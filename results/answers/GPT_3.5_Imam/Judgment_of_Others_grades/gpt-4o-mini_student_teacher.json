  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that demonstrates an understanding of the importance of humility, self-awareness, and compassion in both Islam and Christianity when dealing with the faults of others. However, the student did not directly quote or reference the specific teaching of Jesus in response to the question. While the student did mention the importance of removing the plank from our own eye before pointing out the speck in someone else's eye, the direct reference to Luke 6:41-42 was not made. This lack of specificity slightly diminishes the effectiveness of the response in addressing the concern provided."
