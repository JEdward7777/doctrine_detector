  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical teaching on pointing out the faults of others. The reference to Matthew 7:3-5 is accurate and relevant, highlighting the importance of addressing one's own shortcomings before criticizing others. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic teachings on humility and mercy towards others adds depth and breadth to the response. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly connecting the biblical teachings to the Christian worldview and addressing the specific concern about hypocrisy and witness."
