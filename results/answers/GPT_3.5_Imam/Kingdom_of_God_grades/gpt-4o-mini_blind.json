However, from a Christian worldview, it is crucial to prioritize doctrinal accuracy in conveying the concept of the \"Kingdom of God.\" While cultural adaptation is important for effective communication, altering the term to something like \"Divine Presence\" or \"Realm of God\" could potentially dilute the theological significance and may not fully capture the true meaning of the Kingdom of God as taught in Scripture. A more robust discussion on the theological implications and potential risks of rephrasing such a foundational concept would strengthen the answer."
