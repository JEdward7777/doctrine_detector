However, from a Christian perspective, retaining the original term is crucial to preserve the depth and biblical context of the concept. The student could have emphasized more on the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term \"Kingdom of God\" and how explanations can help convey its true meaning to different cultural contexts without losing its essence."
