  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response acknowledges the concern about rephrasing losing the depth and biblical context of the term \"Kingdom of God\" and instead suggests alternative ways to convey the concept that are more relatable to the target audience. The emphasis on maintaining the essence and meaning of the original concept shows an understanding of the importance of preserving the biblical context.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response does not directly address the concern about rephrasing losing depth and biblical context. While it acknowledges this concern, it does not provide a comprehensive explanation or argument to alleviate this worry.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a thoughtful approach to translation by considering the cultural context of the target audience while also acknowledging the importance of preserving the biblical context. With some further development on addressing the concern about rephrasing losing depth and biblical context, this response could be even stronger."
