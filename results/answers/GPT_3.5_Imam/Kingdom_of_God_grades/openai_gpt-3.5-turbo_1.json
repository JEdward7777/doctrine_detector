  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of retaining the term \"Kingdom of God\" to preserve its spiritual and eschatological significance. It also rightly addresses the concern that rephrasing could potentially lose the depth and biblical context of the term. However, while the response suggests providing explanations about the term's significance, it could have further emphasized the importance of enriching the audience's understanding within their cultural context without altering the core meaning of the term. Overall, a solid response with room for a bit more emphasis on the importance of providing contextual explanations."
