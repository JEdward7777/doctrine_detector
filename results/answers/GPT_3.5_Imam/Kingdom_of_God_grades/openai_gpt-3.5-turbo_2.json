The suggested approach of retaining the term and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance aligns well with a Christian worldview that values the integrity and richness of biblical concepts. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of preserving the biblical essence of the term to fully align with a Christian perspective."
