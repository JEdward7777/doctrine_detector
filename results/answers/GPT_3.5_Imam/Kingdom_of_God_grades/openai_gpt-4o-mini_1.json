The concern about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term through rephrasing is effectively addressed. The only slight deduction is that there could be further elaboration on why maintaining the original term is essential in preserving the specific theological nuances and implications associated with the \"Kingdom of God.\" Overall, a very well-argued and insightful response."
