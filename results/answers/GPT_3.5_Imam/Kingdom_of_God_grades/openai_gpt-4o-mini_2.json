  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and well-reasoned argument for retaining the term \"Kingdom of God\" and explaining its spiritual and eschatological significance. It acknowledges the concern that rephrasing could potentially lose the depth and biblical context of the term. However, deducting a few points for not explicitly addressing how cultural context can still be respectfully acknowledged while retaining the original term. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of maintaining the integrity and richness of religious concepts in translation."
