## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The term "kingdom of heaven" is often used in the Gospel of Matthew instead of "kingdom of God" that is used in other Gospels. This phrase is significant because it emphasizes the sovereignty and majesty of God in the context of the coming of His kingdom on earth.

The term "heaven" in this context signifies the ultimate reality and the divine realm where God's rule is supreme. By using this term, the Gospel of Matthew emphasizes the transcendence and authority of God in establishing His kingdom. It reminds believers that the kingdom is not merely a physical or earthly entity, but a spiritual reality that is intricately linked to God's divine plan.

Furthermore, the term "heaven" in the expression "kingdom of heaven" highlights the eschatological aspect of the kingdom. It points to the future fulfillment of God's promises and the ultimate reign of God in the new heavens and the new earth.

Overall, retaining the term "heaven" in the phrase "kingdom of heaven" in the book of Matthew serves to emphasize the spiritual, transcendent, and eschatological dimensions of God's sovereign rule and His ultimate plan for redemption and restoration.
