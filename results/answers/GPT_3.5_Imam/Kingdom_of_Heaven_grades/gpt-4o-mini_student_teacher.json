  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the Gospel of Matthew. They effectively highlighted the theological implications and the unique emphasis that term brings to Matthew's gospel. The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic and connected it well to the biblical context. However, the response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern regarding the importance of understanding unique terminology used in the gospels. Despite this, the student's explanation was well-written and offered valuable insights."
