  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student's response accurately highlights the significance of using \"kingdom of heaven\" in Matthew's Gospel, emphasizing its distinctiveness from other Gospels' use of \"kingdom of God\". They also provide some excellent theological insights, such as the connection to eschatology and the transcendence of God's rule. The writing is clear and well-structured, making it easy to follow.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of addressing the concern about understanding unique terminology in the Gospels, showing how this particular phrase sheds light on Matthew's intended message.\n\nTo improve, I would suggest adding more depth and nuance to the discussion. For instance, exploring the cultural or historical context that might have influenced Matthew's choice of language could add richness to the analysis. Additionally, providing a few examples from the Gospel itself to illustrate the theological implications of \"kingdom of heaven\" would strengthen the student's argument.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of \"kingdom of heaven\" in Matthew's Gospel."
