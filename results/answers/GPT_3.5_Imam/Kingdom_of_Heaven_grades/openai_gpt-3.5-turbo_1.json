It effectively connects this theological concept to the sovereignty, transcendence, eschatology, and spiritual dimensions of God's reign. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the unique terminology used in the gospels and effectively conveys the intended theological implications of this specific phrase in Matthew's gospel."
