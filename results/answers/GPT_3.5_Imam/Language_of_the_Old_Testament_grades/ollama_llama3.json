  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response correctly states that the majority of the Old Testament was written in ancient Hebrew, which aligns with the given answer. It also provides additional information about the use of Aramaic in certain books, which is accurate and adds value to the response.\n\nThe only reason it's not a perfect score is that the response could be even more concise and direct in its agreement with the given answer. For example, it could have simply stated \"The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with some small portions in Aramaic\" without providing additional context or examples.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of knowing the original languages of Scripture and provides accurate information to support that understanding."
