I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response correctly states that the majority of the Old Testament was written in ancient Hebrew, which aligns with the given answer. It also provides additional information about the use of Aramaic in certain books, which is accurate and adds value to the response.

The only reason it's not a perfect score is that the response could be even more concise and direct in its agreement with the given answer.
