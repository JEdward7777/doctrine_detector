In Islam, believers typically meet in mosques for congregational prayers, community gatherings, and Islamic teachings. The mosque serves as the central place for Muslims to come together to worship, learn, and interact with one another. Muslims are encouraged to attend the mosque regularly for prayers, especially the Friday congregational prayer (Jumu'ah), which is obligatory for adult men.
