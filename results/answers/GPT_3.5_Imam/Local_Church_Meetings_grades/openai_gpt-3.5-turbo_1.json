However, the response does not address the specific Islamic context of congregational prayers in mosques as detailed in the original answer. Encouraging believers to gather in homes for fellowship is commendable, but it would be more complete by incorporating aspects unique to Islamic traditions such as mosque congregational prayers and community events."
