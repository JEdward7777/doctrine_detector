However, it did not address the question directly about Romans 8:23 and the adoption of sons in a Christian context. The answer failed to apply a Christian specific worldview and did not engage with the doctrinal significance of the verse for believers. It is crucial to focus on interpreting biblical verses accurately within their Christian theological framework when addressing such questions."
