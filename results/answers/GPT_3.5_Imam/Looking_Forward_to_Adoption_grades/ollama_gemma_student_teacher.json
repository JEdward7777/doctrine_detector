However, the answer lacks specific engagement with the text Romans 8:23 and does not provide detailed explanations regarding the believer's anticipation and hope in the context of adoption. Additionally, the answer could benefit from clearer elaboration on the relationship between the current state of believers and the future fulfillment of their adoption as God's children."
