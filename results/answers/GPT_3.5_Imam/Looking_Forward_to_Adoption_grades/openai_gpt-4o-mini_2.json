However, the integration of Islamic beliefs on adoption and believers' relationship with Allah, while informative, slightly detracted from the focus on the Christian worldview. Overall, the explanation given aligns well with the concern of understanding the hope and future aspect of being adopted into God's family from a Christian perspective."
