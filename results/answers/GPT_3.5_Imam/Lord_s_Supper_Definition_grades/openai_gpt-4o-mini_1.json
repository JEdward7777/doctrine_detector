  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response correctly states the basic understanding of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith, emphasizing its connection to the Passover meal and its symbolism of Jesus' sacrifice for sin. However, it could have provided more depth and elaboration on the theological significance and spiritual impact of the Lord's Supper in the Christian tradition. Overall, the response demonstrates a foundational understanding but lacks in depth."
