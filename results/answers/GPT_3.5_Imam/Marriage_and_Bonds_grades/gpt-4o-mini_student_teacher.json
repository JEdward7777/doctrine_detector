  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-articulated response from an Islamic perspective highlighting the sacredness of marriage and the importance of commitment, love, and mutual respect between spouses, the answer did not directly address the Christian perspective as requested. To fully address the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships, it is important for the response to focus on biblical principles specific to Christianity. The student's insights were thoughtful and relevant but lacked the Christian worldview necessary for the given question and concern."
