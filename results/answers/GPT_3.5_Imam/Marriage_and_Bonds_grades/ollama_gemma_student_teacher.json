  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of the 'bond of marriage' from a Christian perspective. However, the response focuses on Islamic principles rather than Christian teachings. While there are similarities between Islamic and Christian beliefs about marriage, the student's answer does not address the specific concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships as specified in the grading criteria."
