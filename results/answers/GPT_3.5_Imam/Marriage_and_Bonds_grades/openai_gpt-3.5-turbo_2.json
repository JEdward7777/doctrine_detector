  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the response provides valuable insights from an Islamic perspective on marriage and emphasizes the importance of mutual respect and commitment between spouses, the concern specified a need to promote strong, Christ-centered marriages. The response does not directly address this concern as it focuses on Islamic principles rather than Christian ones. However, the concept of marriage as a sacred commitment established by God and the importance of mutual support and love can align with Christian beliefs to some extent. A higher grade could be achieved by explicitly mentioning Christian values and principles related to marriage."
