However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that the foundation of marriage is rooted in God's design as outlined in the Bible. While there are similarities in values such as mutual support and love, the Christian emphasis on Christ-centered marriages may differ in key theological aspects. It would be beneficial to further explore and incorporate Christian teachings on marriage into the response to better align with the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design."
