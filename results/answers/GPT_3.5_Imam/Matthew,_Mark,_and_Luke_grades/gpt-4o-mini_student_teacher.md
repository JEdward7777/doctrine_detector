Grade: 85

Comment: The student correctly identified the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Acts where the names of the twelve disciples are listed, which demonstrates a good understanding of the New Testament Scriptures. However, the addition of Acts in the student's response was unnecessary as the twelve disciples are primarily named in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke according to the reference answer.
