  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke as containing the names of the twelve disciples. Additionally, they provide specific chapter and verse references for each list. While the inclusion of Acts is a commendable effort, it's not strictly necessary to answer the question within the specified reference answer."
