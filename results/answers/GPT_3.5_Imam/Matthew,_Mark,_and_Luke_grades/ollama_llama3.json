  "grade": 67.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 67.\n\nWhile the response correctly identifies the relevant books (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) that contain the list of disciples, it doesn't fully address the concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. The original answer only mentions three books, whereas the correct information includes Acts as well. Additionally, the response could have provided more specific details about each disciple or their roles in the early Christian church.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have gone beyond simply listing the books and provided more insight into the significance of the disciples' names, their relationships with Jesus, or how they contributed to the spread of Christianity."
