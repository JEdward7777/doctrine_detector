  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies that the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which demonstrates a familiarity with the Gospel accounts. However, there was a slight oversight in not mentioning the inclusion of the disciple names in the book of Acts as well, which is also a crucial part of the New Testament where the disciples are listed. Overall, the response shows good knowledge and understanding of the topic, but could have been more comprehensive."
