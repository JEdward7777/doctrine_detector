However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the theological significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies, emphasizing the unique and salvific role of the Messiah in Christianity compared to other beliefs. Additionally, the mention of Islamic beliefs slightly detracts from the focus on Christian doctrine in this context."
