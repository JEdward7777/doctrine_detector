They rightly identified key prophecies such as the virgin birth and lineage from King David. However, there was a missed opportunity to emphasize the critical importance of understanding these prophecies in strengthening faith in Jesus as the Messiah. Encouraging the student to tie the fulfillment of these prophecies to the significance of Jesus as the Messiah would have enhanced the quality of their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
