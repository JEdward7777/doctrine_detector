The explanation effectively connects these prophecies to Jesus as the Messiah, demonstrating an understanding of their significance in strengthening faith in Him. The response could have been improved by including additional prophecies and their fulfillment by Jesus to provide a more comprehensive understanding, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised. Great job!"
