In Islamic belief, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered one of the great messengers of Allah, rather than the Messiah. However, in Christian belief, Jesus is considered the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies found in the Old Testament.

Some of the prophecies about the Messiah in the Old Testament include:

1. The Messiah will be born of a virgin: This prophecy is found in Isaiah 7:14. Jesus' birth to the Virgin Mary is seen as the fulfillment of this prophecy in the New Testament.

2. The Messiah will be from the line of David: In 2 Samuel 7:12-13, there is a promise to King David that one of his descendants will establish a kingdom that will last forever. Jesus is understood to be from the line of David, fulfilling this prophecy.

3. The Messiah will be a suffering servant: Isaiah 53 describes a servant who will suffer on behalf of others. Christians believe that Jesus' crucifixion and death fulfilled this prophecy.

4. The Messiah will be a light to the Gentiles: Isaiah 42:6 and Isaiah 49:6 mention that the Messiah will bring salvation not only to the Israelites but also to the Gentiles. Christians believe that through Jesus, salvation is offered to all people, fulfilling this prophecy.

There are many more prophecies in the Old Testament that Christians believe Jesus fulfilled as the Messiah. Muslims also believe in the miraculous birth of Jesus and his prophethood, but do not see him as the literal fulfillment of these specific Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah.
