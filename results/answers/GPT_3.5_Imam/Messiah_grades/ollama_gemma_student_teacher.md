## Question [Messiah](../../../questions/Messiah.md)
How can the term 'Messiah' be explained in a context with different religious expectations of a savior?

## Correct Answer
Teach that 'Messiah' means 'Anointed One' and explain Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His unique role as savior.

## Stated Concern
Clear teaching helps differentiate Jesus' role from other religious savior figures while staying true to scripture.

## [Answer](../Messiah.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, the term "Messiah" refers to Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, who is believed to be a mighty prophet and messenger of Allah. Muslims believe that Prophet Isa will return before the Day of Judgment as a just ruler and a savior to restore justice and peace on Earth.

In Christianity, the term "Messiah" is used to refer to Jesus Christ as the savior and redeemer of humanity. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God who came to Earth to atone for the sins of humanity through his death and resurrection.

In Judaism, the concept of the Messiah differs from both Islam and Christianity. Jews believe in the coming of a future descendant of King David who will be anointed as a king and lead the Jewish people to redemption and establish the reign of God on Earth. This figure is seen as a political and military leader who will bring about a time of peace and prosperity.

Despite these differences in the concept of the Messiah, all three Abrahamic faiths share the belief in the coming of a savior who will bring about a time of peace, justice, and righteousness. Muslims, Christians, and Jews may have different expectations and interpretations of the Messiah, but the underlying hope for a divinely appointed leader to guide and save humanity is a common thread that unites these faith traditions.
