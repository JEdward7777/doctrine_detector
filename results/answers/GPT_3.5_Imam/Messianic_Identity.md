## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (peace be upon him) is recognized as a prophet and the Messiah, also known as the Christ. However, the title "King of the Jews" is a term that has been used in the Christian Gospels to refer to Jesus. This title was given to Jesus by Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, during the trial leading to his crucifixion.

From a Muslim perspective, it is important to understand that Jesus' true identity and mission are not centered around earthly kingdoms or political titles. Rather, Jesus is revered and esteemed as a prophet and messenger of God who was sent to guide the Children of Israel and preach the message of monotheism and righteous living.

The title "King of the Jews" ascribed to Jesus during his trial does not diminish his status as the Messiah in Islamic belief. It is essential for Muslims to focus on Jesus' teachings, his miracles, and his role as a guide for humanity rather than getting caught up in political titles or worldly power dynamics.
