The focus on Jesus as a prophet and messenger in Islam is valid but does not sufficiently engage with the significance of the title 'King of the Jews' in relation to Jesus' messianic role according to Christian beliefs. The student should have explored how the title establishes Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the promised King in Christian theology."
