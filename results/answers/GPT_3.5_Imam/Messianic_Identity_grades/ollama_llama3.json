While it's accurate that Jesus is revered as a prophet and messenger of God in Islam, the concern was specifically about understanding Jesus' messianic role in the Christian faith. The response could have explored more deeply how this title relates to Jesus' role as the promised Messiah and its implications for his eternal reign."
