  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 60.\n\nWhile the student made good effort in explaining the concept of \"ministering\" from an Islamic perspective, the answer does not specifically address the question asking for the Christian viewpoint. The student should have focused more on the biblical understanding of 'ministering' rather than solely discussing the Islamic beliefs and practices. The response could have been improved by comparing or contrasting the Islamic concept with the Christian concept of 'ministering' according to the Bible."
