  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response from an Islamic perspective on serving and guiding others based on the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad. However, in the context of the given concern about defining ministry according to the Bible, the student's answer does not directly address the Christian specific understanding of ministry as serving others by teaching them about God and caring for their spiritual and physical needs. The student's response focused more on general acts of service and guidance within Islam rather than framing it within the Christian perspective of ministry."
