  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of ministry within the Islamic worldview. However, it does not fully align with the given reference answer from the teacher, which focuses on serving others through teaching and caring for their spiritual and physical needs. The student's answer expands the definition to include broader concepts of service, such as promoting justice and guiding people towards righteousness. While these additional aspects are valuable, they are not explicitly related to the act of teaching or caring for spiritual needs."
