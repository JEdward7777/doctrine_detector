  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive explanation of how the concept of ministering is understood and practiced within Islam, focusing on serving, guiding, and promoting virtuous behavior. While it did not directly address the given Christian-specific definition of ministry, it effectively highlighted the Islamic perspective on service and spiritual guidance. To improve the grade, the response could have incorporated a comparison to the Christian view of ministry or acknowledged the importance of understanding different religious perspectives in serving others effectively."
