From a Christian worldview, understanding the specific biblical principles and practices related to ministry is essential for effective service within the church and community. The response could have been improved by drawing parallels between the Islamic concept of service and ministry in Christianity, emphasizing the importance of aligning service with biblical teachings for Christians."
