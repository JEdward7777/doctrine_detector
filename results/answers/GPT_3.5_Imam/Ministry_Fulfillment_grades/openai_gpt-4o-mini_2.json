The connection between serving others and understanding/executing one's God-given purpose is effectively highlighted. However, there is room for improvement in applying a Christian worldview throughout the response and providing more specific scriptural references to support the explanation. Additionally, as a Muslim Imam, it would have been beneficial to acknowledge any differences in belief systems between Islam and Christianity related to ministry and serving others."
