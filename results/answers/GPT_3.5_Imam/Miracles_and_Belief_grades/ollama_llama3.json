  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response generally aligns with the provided answer and concern. It provides a clear explanation of the role of miracles in demonstrating God's power and leading others to faith, which addresses the concern of understanding their role in evangelism and personal faith. The text also mentions the importance of reflection and contemplation among people, which is relevant to the concern.\n\nHowever, there are some minor areas for improvement. For example, the response could have explored more specific examples of miracles from Christian scripture or tradition. Additionally, while it mentions the idea that faith ultimately comes from within, it could have delved deeper into what this means practically for personal evangelism and apologetics.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith, but could benefit from some additional development and nuance."
