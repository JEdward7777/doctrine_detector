# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
Miracles are extraordinary events that defy the natural laws and are believed to be manifestations of God's power and presence. In Islam, miracles are viewed as signs from God that serve as evidence of His existence, power, and divine guidance.

When a miracle occurs, it serves as a clear indication of the existence of a higher power beyond human comprehension. It shows that there are forces at work in the universe that go beyond the limits of human understanding and control. Miracles are seen as a manifestation of God's mercy, compassion, and intervention in the lives of His creation.

In the Quran, the holy book of Islam, numerous accounts of miracles performed by the prophets are mentioned as evidence of their truthfulness and as signs for people to believe in the existence of God. For example, the miracles of Prophet Moses parting the Red Sea, Prophet Jesus raising the dead, and Prophet Muhammad splitting the moon are all seen as clear signs of God's power and existence.

Miracles are also meant to provoke reflection and contemplation among people. They are intended to make people question the nature of reality and the limits of human knowledge, leading them to acknowledge the existence of a supernatural realm beyond the material world.

Ultimately, miracles serve as a means to strengthen one's faith and belief in God. They provide a tangible and visible demonstration of His existence and power, encouraging people to turn to Him in worship and submission. However, it is important to remember that while miracles can serve as signs that lead to belief, faith ultimately comes from within and is a personal choice that each individual must make.
