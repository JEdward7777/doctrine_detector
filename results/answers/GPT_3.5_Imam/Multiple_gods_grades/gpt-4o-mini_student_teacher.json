  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 80.\n\nWhile the student did a good job explaining the concept of the Trinity and using analogies to clarify the monotheistic nature of Christianity, there was a slight deviation from the reference answer provided by the teacher. The reference answer specifically emphasizes the need for clear biblical teaching, which the student's answer lacked in depth. Encouraging the student to include more explicit references to scripture or specific biblical passages to support their explanation would have enhanced the integrity of Christian doctrine in their response."
