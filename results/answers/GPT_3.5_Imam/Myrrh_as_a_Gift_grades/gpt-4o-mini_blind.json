The connection between myrrh as a symbol of future suffering and sacrifice, as well as its association with anointing and purification, is well explained. Good job in highlighting the spiritual aspects related to myrrh and Jesus' mission. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the biblical context and significance of myrrh in the specific cultural and religious practices of the time for a more thorough analysis."
