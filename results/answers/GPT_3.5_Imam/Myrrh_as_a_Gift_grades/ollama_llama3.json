  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively interprets the significance of myrrh as a gift to Jesus, highlighting its connection to his future suffering and sacrifice. The explanation of myrrh's use in ancient times for medicinal and aromatic purposes provides context for its inclusion among the gifts, and the symbolic interpretation of myrrh's use in the anointing of the deceased is well-made.\n\nThe response also does a good job of aligning the symbolism of myrrh with Jesus' message as a healer and bringer of spiritual renewal. The conclusion effectively summarizes the significance of myrrh as a reminder of Jesus' earthly mission, including suffering, sacrifice, and redemption for humanity.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is in providing more explicit connections between the symbolism of myrrh and Jesus' purpose and mission, which is the concern being addressed. While the response does touch on this theme, it could be further developed to provide a more direct answer to the question. Overall, however, this response provides a thoughtful and well-supported explanation of the significance of myrrh as a gift to Jesus."
