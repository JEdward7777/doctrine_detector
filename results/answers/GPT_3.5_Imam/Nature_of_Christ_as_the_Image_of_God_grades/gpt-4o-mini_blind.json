  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The response accurately discusses the Christian belief that Jesus is the image of God and explains its significance well. However, the response focuses primarily on the Islamic perspective of Jesus rather than providing a deeper exploration of the Christian understanding. To improve the grade, the student should have delved more into the theological implications of Jesus being the image of God within Christian doctrine."
