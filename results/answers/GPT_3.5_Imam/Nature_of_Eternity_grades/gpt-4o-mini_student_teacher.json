  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of how eternity is defined in the context of Christian beliefs, touching on the concepts of everlasting life, existence beyond time and space, and the implications of one's choices in this life. However, the student made an inaccurate comparison by introducing Muslim beliefs, which was not relevant to the question about Christian beliefs specifically. This distracted from the clarity and focus of the answer."
