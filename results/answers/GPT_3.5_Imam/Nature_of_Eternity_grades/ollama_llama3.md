In Christian beliefs, eternity is often understood as the concept of everlasting life and existence beyond time and space. It refers to the state of being with God in the afterlife, either in heaven or hell, based on a person's faith and deeds in their earthly life. Christians believe that eternity is a timeless existence where individuals will experience either eternal joy and peace in the presence of God or eternal separation from Him.

It is important to note that while Muslims and Christians may have some differences in their beliefs around the concept of eternity, both faiths emphasize the importance of living a righteous life and following God's commandments to attain a favorable outcome in the afterlife.
