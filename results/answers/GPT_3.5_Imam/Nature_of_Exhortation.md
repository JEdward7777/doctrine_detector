## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the teachings of the New Testament, particularly in the words of Jesus, Christians are encouraged to exhort one another in a spirit of love and humility. The Apostle Paul, in his letters, also emphasizes the importance of exhortation in building up the body of believers and helping each other grow in faith and righteousness.

One key aspect of exhortation in the New Testament is the idea of speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). This means that when exhorting someone, Christians should do so with gentleness and respect, seeking to build up rather than tear down. It is important to approach exhortation with the motive of helping the other person draw closer to God and live in accordance with His will.

Another important principle in exhortation is to focus on addressing sin or problems in a person's life while also offering encouragement, support, and hope. Christians should exhort one another not out of a sense of superiority or judgment, but out of a desire to see each other grow in holiness and maturity in Christ.

In terms of practical application, Christians can exhort one another through gentle reminders, sharing relevant scripture verses, offering prayers and support, and providing practical help or guidance when needed. It is also important to be willing to receive exhortation ourselves and to humbly accept correction from others.

Overall, exhortation in the New Testament is meant to be a positive and constructive act done out of love and concern for one another's spiritual well-being. It is a way for Christians to encourage and uplift each other on their journey of faith.
