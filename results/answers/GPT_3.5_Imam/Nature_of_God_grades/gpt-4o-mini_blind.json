However, the answer does not directly address the Christian context of Jesus' statement that \"God is spirit.\" The focus should have been on how this understanding influences worship from a Christian worldview, rather than solely discussing Islamic beliefs. Additionally, there is a lack of discussion on the significance of Jesus' statement in shaping Christian worship practices. A more thorough exploration of the implications of God's spiritual nature in shaping Christian worship would have improved the response."
