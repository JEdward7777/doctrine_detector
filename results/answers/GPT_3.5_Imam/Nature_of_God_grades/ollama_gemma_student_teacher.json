  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of God as spirit in both Christianity and Islam. They effectively explain the spiritual nature of God and how this understanding should influence worship. The answer is well-reasoned and supported by relevant scriptures from both traditions. Additionally, the student clearly articulates the need for spiritual engagement rather than physical rituals in worship."
