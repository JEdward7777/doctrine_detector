## [Answer](../Nature_of_God.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Christian context, the statement that "God is spirit" can be found in the New Testament in the Gospel of John 4:24 where Jesus is speaking to the Samaritan woman at the well. In this verse, Jesus is emphasizing the spiritual nature of God, highlighting that God is not limited by physical form or location.

As Muslims, we believe in the oneness and transcendence of Allah (God) and that He is beyond human comprehension. In Islam, Allah is described as being beyond time and space, not limited by physical attributes, and not requiring a body or form. The concept of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, is central to our faith.

Our worship should be influenced by this understanding by focusing on developing a deep spiritual connection with Allah, recognizing His transcendence, and submitting ourselves completely to His will. This means that our worship should be sincere, humble, and free from any form of associating partners with Allah or attributing human characteristics to Him.

We should worship Allah with full devotion, seeking His pleasure and guidance in our lives, and striving to adhere to His commands and teachings. Our worship should be performed with humility, reverence, and a sense of awe towards the greatness and majesty of Allah as the ultimate Spirit and Creator of all things.
