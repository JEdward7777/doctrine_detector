  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of hell as mentioned in the Bible, emphasizing its role as a place of punishment and separation from God for those who reject Him. While the response incorporates some key aspects of the Christian understanding of hell, it lacks specificity and depth in comparison to the reference answer provided. Additionally, the student's perspective as a Muslim Imam could potentially present a differing theological viewpoint which may not fully align with a Christian-specific worldview."
