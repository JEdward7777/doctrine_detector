  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the nature and experience of hell as described in the Bible. However, it is important to note that the student's perspective is rooted in Islamic teachings rather than Christianity. While the concept of hell is similar across religions, there may be variations in the details and beliefs. The answer would be more appropriate if it focused exclusively on the Christian perspective on hell as requested in the prompt."
