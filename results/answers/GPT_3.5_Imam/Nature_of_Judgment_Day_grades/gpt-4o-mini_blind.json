  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer a 60. While the student accurately describes the general concept of 'judgment day' in Christianity, there are significant theological inaccuracies present in the response. As a Muslim Imam, the student may not have the depth of understanding of Christian beliefs required to provide a fully accurate explanation. Additionally, the answer could have included more specific references to Bible verses that speak about judgment day in the Christian context. The comparison between Islam and Christianity, while briefly mentioned, could have been expanded upon or omitted altogether to stay focused on the question at hand."
