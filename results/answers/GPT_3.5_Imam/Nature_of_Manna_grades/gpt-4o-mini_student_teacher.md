Grade: 90

Comment: The student accurately described the appearance and taste of manna as "fine, flake-like thing" and similar to wafers made with honey, which aligns with the biblical description. The student also correctly linked this to the miraculous provision of God for the Israelites in the wilderness. There is a minor discrepancy in mentioning coriander seed, which was not specifically part of the biblical description but does not significantly impact the accuracy of the answer in relation to the concern of understanding God's miraculous provision.
