  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately describes the physical appearance of manna as \"fine, flake-like\" and its color as \"white like coriander seed.\" Additionally, they correctly referenced the book of Exodus as the source of this information. The student also appropriately recognized manna as a miraculous provision from God. While the description of the taste as \"wafers made with honey\" is not explicitly found in the scriptures, it is a common interpretation and accurately reflects the sweetness associated with manna."
