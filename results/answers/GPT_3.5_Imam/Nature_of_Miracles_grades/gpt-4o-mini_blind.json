From a Christian standpoint, while it is acknowledged that Jesus is a significant figure in Islam, the miracles performed by Jesus, such as healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, and raising the dead, reveal His identity as the Son of God and the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament. The answer would benefit from incorporating Christian beliefs about Jesus' divinity and His unique role in salvation."
