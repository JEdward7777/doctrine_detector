  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on Jesus's miracles. However, it does not fully address the concern of affirming Jesus's divine nature as specified in the grading criteria. The reference answer suggests that the miracles reveal Jesus's divinity, while the student's answer focuses on his prophethood and special abilities. While the student's answer is well-written and demonstrates deep knowledge of Islamic beliefs about Jesus, it does not go beyond the limits of the Christian specific worldview."
