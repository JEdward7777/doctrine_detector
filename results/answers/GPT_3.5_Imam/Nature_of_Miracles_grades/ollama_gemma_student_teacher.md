## [Answer](../Nature_of_Miracles.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a mighty prophet and messenger of Allah. The miracles associated with Jesus mentioned in the Qur'an also reveal important aspects of his identity.

The miracles of Jesus, including healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, and even raising the dead, demonstrate his special status and closeness to Allah. These miracles serve as a sign of Allah's power and mercy, as well as demonstrate Jesus's role as a prophet with the ability to perform extraordinary acts by the permission of God.

In Islam, Jesus is known as Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary), and he is honored as one of the great prophets who delivered the message of monotheism to his people. The miracles he performed were intended to guide the people towards faith in Allah and to demonstrate his special mission as a prophet.

In conclusion, the miracles performed by Jesus reveal his identity as a chosen prophet of Allah with special abilities and a close relationship with the Divine.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on Jesus's miracles. However, it does not fully address the concern of affirming Jesus's divine nature as specified in the grading criteria. The reference answer suggests that the miracles reveal Jesus's divinity, while the student's answer focuses on his prophethood and special abilities. While the student's answer is well-written and demonstrates deep knowledge of Islamic beliefs about Jesus, it does not go beyond the limits of the Christian specific worldview.
