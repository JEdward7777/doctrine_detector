  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided by the student does not align with the Christian belief in Jesus as the divine Son of God and the Messiah. The student's understanding of Jesus's miracles as affirming His divine nature is not accurately represented in the Islamic perspective presented in the response. The answer lacks a clear recognition of Jesus's divinity as understood in the Christian worldview."
