They correctly mention that these terms are used interchangeably to refer to divinely inspired writings and emphasize the sacred and authoritative nature of the teachings. However, to improve, they could have further underscored the unique and central role of the Bible as the primary source of Christian scripture in detailing the relationship between scripture and the word of God within a Christian worldview."
