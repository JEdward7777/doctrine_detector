  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and concise explanation of the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word, drawing from a Christian perspective. The integration of the biblical context and the broader theological understanding of \"the word of God\" enriches the explanation. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect how the written scriptures serve as a manifestation of God's spoken word, emphasizing their divine inspiration and authority."
