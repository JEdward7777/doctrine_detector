  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on the roles of sinful nature and external influences in temptation. However, the answer does not align with a Christian worldview, which is the perspective requested for grading. From a Christian standpoint, the concept of \"nafs\" as described in Islamic teachings differs from the understanding of a sinful nature in Christian theology. Additionally, the emphasis on seeking guidance from the Quran and Sunnah, which are fundamental sources in Islam, would not be applicable to a Christian context. To improve the grade, the response should have provided a perspective based on Christian teachings and used biblical references to support the discussion."
