  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how sinful nature and external influences relate to temptation in Islamic teachings. However, the student did not directly address the question on the sources and reasons for temptation in Christian teaching. The answer given is not aligned with a Christian specific worldview, which impacts the grade given. It is important to focus on the specific teachings and beliefs of Christianity in addressing questions related to this worldview."
