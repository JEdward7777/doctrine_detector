## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, humans are believed to have both a sinful nature (nafs) and external influences that can lead them towards temptation and wrongdoing. The nafs is often described as the lower self or ego that is inclined towards desires and temptation. This inner struggle is mentioned in the Quran where Allah says, "And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil, except those upon which my Lord has mercy." (Quran 12:53)

External influences, such as societal pressures, peer influence, media, and environment, can also play a significant role in leading individuals towards temptation and sin. Islam emphasizes the importance of being conscious of the company we keep and the environments we expose ourselves to, as they can greatly impact our behavior and choices.

It is essential for Muslims to protect themselves from the negative influences of both their sinful nature and external factors by striving to strengthen their faith, seeking guidance from the Quran and Sunnah, and surrounding themselves with righteous company. Additionally, practicing self-discipline, mindfulness, and seeking forgiveness through repentance can help individuals resist temptation and overcome their sinful inclinations.
