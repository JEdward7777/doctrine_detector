The answer should have focused solely on the Christian worldview and biblical references. Furthermore, it is crucial to highlight the unique perspective of Christianity on salvation through faith in Jesus Christ rather than just moral and ethical living. The response lacked doctrinal correctness in fully addressing the Christian view on wickedness, consequences, and redemption."
