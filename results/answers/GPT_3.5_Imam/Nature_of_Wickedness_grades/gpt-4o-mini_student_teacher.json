  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of how the Bible describes wickedness and the consequences for those who engage in it, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. However, the response lacked a clear connection to the concern of how biblical perspectives on wickedness can influence moral behavior and spiritual growth. Additionally, while the student made efforts to draw parallels between Islam and Christianity, a Christian-specific worldview would have been more appropriate for this question. Overall, a good effort but could have been more focused on the specific concerns raised."
