  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55/100\n\nComments: The answer provided contains some accurate information about the general understanding of the soul and spirit in Christianity. However, it lacks doctrinal precision as it raises some theological issues by mixing Islamic teachings with Christian beliefs. Additionally, the response does not delve deeply enough into the biblical basis for the differentiation between soul and spirit, nor does it reference specific biblical passages that address this distinction. The student should focus on providing a more focused and doctrinally accurate explanation based on Christian teachings."
