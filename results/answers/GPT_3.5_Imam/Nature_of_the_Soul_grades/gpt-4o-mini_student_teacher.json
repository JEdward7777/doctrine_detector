  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides some information on the distinction between soul and spirit in Christianity, mentioning the soul as the essence of a person and the spirit as the connection to God. However, the response lacks a clear explanation of how the Bible specifically differentiates between these concepts. Additionally, the mention of Islamic teachings may be irrelevant to the Christian-specific worldview. More focus on biblical references and theological interpretations within Christianity would have strengthened the answer."
