However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern by not explicitly emphasizing the importance of understanding the biblical definitions for accurate interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God. It could have further emphasized the significance of aligning one's beliefs with biblical teachings to ensure a solid foundation in Christian worldview."
