  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a general overview of the concepts of soul and spirit in Christianity, but it lacks depth and specificity in addressing the concern raised regarding biblical definitions for accurate interpretation. While the explanation of soul and spirit is informative, the lack of emphasis on the importance of understanding these concepts according to biblical definitions lowers the grade. More specific references to scriptural passages or theological perspectives would have strengthened the response."
