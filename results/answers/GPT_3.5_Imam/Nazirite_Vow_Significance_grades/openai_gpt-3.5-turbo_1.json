However, the connection to the Nazirite vow in the biblical context could have been strengthened by addressing the spiritual significance and symbolism associated with the restrictions of the Nazirite vow in detail. Further exploration of the parallels or differences between the concepts of voluntary vows in Islam and the Nazirite vow in Judaism would have enhanced the response."
