## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a mighty prophet and messenger of Allah. The concept of a "new covenant" established through Jesus is primarily a Christian belief, as outlined in the New Testament of the Bible. This new covenant symbolizes the relationship between God and humanity, particularly in terms of forgiveness and salvation.

As Muslims, we believe in the concept of Tawheed (the Oneness of God) and that there is a direct relationship between each individual and Allah, without the need for intermediaries or covenants. We believe in seeking forgiveness directly from Allah through sincere repentance and striving to do good deeds.

While we respect the beliefs of our Christian brothers and sisters, as Muslims, our focus remains on following the teachings of the Qur'an and the example of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in our faith and practice.
