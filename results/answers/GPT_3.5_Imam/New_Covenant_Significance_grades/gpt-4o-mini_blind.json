However, the explanation lacks depth in Christian theology and the significance of the new covenant in terms of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins. The response could benefit from a clearer explanation of the Christian perspective on the role of Jesus in bridging the gap between God and humanity through the new covenant."
