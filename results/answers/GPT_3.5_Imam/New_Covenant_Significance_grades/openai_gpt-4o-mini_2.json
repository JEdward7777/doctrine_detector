While the student accurately explains the difference in beliefs between Islam and Christianity regarding the concept of the new covenant, they fail to engage with the core Christian belief of Jesus' sacrifice and its significance in fulfilling God's promises. In a Christian worldview, understanding and acknowledging the redemptive power of Jesus' sacrifice is fundamental to grasping the depth of God's love and grace towards humanity."
