  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good overview of the relevance of the Psalms in Christian faith and practice, mentioning their importance and themes. However, the student missed the specific instruction from the New Testament that Christians are given regarding singing psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him. This specific instruction is crucial in understanding how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship. Overall, a solid effort but lacking in addressing the specific instruction provided in the reference answer."
