## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, Christians are not given specific instructions regarding the Psalms as a whole. However, the Psalms are often quoted and referenced in the New Testament, showing their importance and relevance to Christian faith and practice. For example, Jesus himself quoted from the Psalms, particularly during his crucifixion and resurrection.

 Christians may find value in reading, studying, and meditating on the Psalms as part of their spiritual growth and worship. The themes of praise, thanksgiving, supplication, and trust found in the Psalms can resonate with Christians in their own prayers and devotion. Additionally, the Psalms are seen as prophetic in Christian theology, pointing towards Jesus Christ and his redemptive work.

Overall, while Christians are not given specific instructions on how to engage with the Psalms in the New Testament, the Psalms continue to hold a significant place in Christian worship and spiritual life.
