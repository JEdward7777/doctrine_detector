It acknowledges the value of the Psalms in spiritual growth and their relevance to Christian faith, while also recognizing their prophetic significance in pointing towards Jesus Christ. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly tying the instructions in the New Testament to the contemporary application in Christian worship. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the relationship between the Psalms and Christian faith."
