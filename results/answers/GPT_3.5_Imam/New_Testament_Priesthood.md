## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of believers in Jesus being considered priests is rooted in the idea of the priesthood of all believers. This concept highlights the belief that every follower of Jesus has direct access to God and can serve as a mediator between humanity and God.

In Christianity, the traditional understanding of priesthood often associates it with ordained clergy who have specific roles and responsibilities within the church. However, the idea of the priesthood of all believers emphasizes that all believers have a priestly role in their relationship with God.

This concept is influenced by passages in the New Testament, such as 1 Peter 2:9, which describes believers as "a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, Godâ€™s special possession." This verse highlights the idea that all believers have a priestly role in offering spiritual sacrifices to God and proclaiming His greatness to the world.

Therefore, being considered a priest in the New Testament means that every believer has the privilege and responsibility to approach God directly, offer worship and prayers on behalf of themselves and others, and participate in the mission of spreading the message of salvation to the world.

Ultimately, the concept of the priesthood of all believers reflects the equality and access to God that all believers have through faith in Jesus Christ, regardless of their specific roles or titles within the church.
