  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers, rooted in New Testament passages and emphasizing the idea that all believers have a priestly role in their relationship with God. It effectively connects the concept to the privilege and responsibility of believers to approach God directly, offer worship and prayers, and participate in spreading the message of salvation. The explanation is clear, well-supported, and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
