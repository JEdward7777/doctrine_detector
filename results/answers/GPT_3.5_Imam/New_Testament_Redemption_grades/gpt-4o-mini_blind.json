  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and accurate comparison of the concept of purification between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The student correctly highlights the shift from external rituals to internal purification and emphasizes the importance of repentance and seeking forgiveness. One improvement could be to include specific references to key passages or teachings from both the Old and New Testaments to enhance the depth of the answer. Overall, a well-structured and doctrinally sound response."
