## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Old Testament, purification rituals were an integral part of the religious practices for the Israelites. These rituals were primarily focused on external cleanliness through practices such as washing with water, offering sacrifices, and following specific guidelines for maintaining purity.

In the New Testament, the concept of purification undergoes a shift. Jesus emphasized the importance of internal purification and spiritual cleanliness over outward rituals. He taught that true purity comes from the heart and one's intentions, rather than just following external rules and regulations.

Jesus also emphasized the role of repentance and seeking forgiveness as a means of purification. Through his teachings and actions, he showed that God is concerned with the purity of the heart and soul, rather than just external appearances.

Overall, while purification was important in both the Old and New Testaments, the emphasis in the New Testament is more on internal purity, repentance, and seeking forgiveness through faith in God's mercy and grace.
