  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of the concept of purification in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the shift from external rituals to internal purity in the New Testament. However, the student fell short in fully addressing the concern of recognizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin. The student mentioned Jesus' teachings on repentance and seeking forgiveness but did not explicitly connect it to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus on the cross as the means of eternal purification. The student's answer could be improved by emphasizing the centrality of Christ's sacrifice in achieving eternal purification from sin in the New Testament."
