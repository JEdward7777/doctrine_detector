It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification from sin. The only room for improvement would be to further elaborate on the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice in cleansing individuals from sin and restoring their relationship with God. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
