## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, the story of Prophet Noah (Nuh in Arabic) and the Ark is mentioned in the Quran as well. The purpose of the Ark, according to Islamic belief, was to save Prophet Noah and those who believed in him from the great flood that was sent as a punishment by Allah to cleanse the earth of corruption and disbelief.

Prophet Noah spent many years warning his people about their wrongdoing and calling them to repent and worship Allah alone. Only a few believed in him, so Allah commanded him to build the Ark to safeguard those believers and the pairs of every kind of animal. The Ark served as a means of salvation and protection from the devastating flood that wiped out the disbelievers.

Ultimately, the purpose of the Ark was to symbolize the mercy, protection, and deliverance that Allah provides to those who remain steadfast in faith and obedience, even in the face of adversity. It is a reminder of the importance of following the guidance of the Prophets and the consequences of rejecting the message of truth.
