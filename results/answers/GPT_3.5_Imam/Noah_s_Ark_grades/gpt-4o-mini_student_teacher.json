  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful answer from an Islamic perspective regarding the purpose of Noah's Ark. However, the concern specified references understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative of Noah's Ark, which focuses on a Christian worldview. The student did not directly address the concept of God's judgment on humanity and the act of preservation as part of God's plan for salvation, which is essential in the Christian interpretation of the story of Noah's Ark. The response, while informative from an Islamic standpoint, did not fully align with the specific concern provided."
