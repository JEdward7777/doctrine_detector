  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of how listening to God in Islam is linked to gaining wisdom. They effectively discuss the importance of understanding and following the teachings of Allah through the Quran and how this process can lead to wise decision-making. However, the response does not directly address the concern of recognizing the connection between obedience to God and wisdom, which is a key aspect from a Christian worldview. The student could strengthen their answer by emphasizing the importance of obedience to God and His will in the pursuit of wisdom."
