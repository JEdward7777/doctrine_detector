In Islam, listening to God is closely tied to gaining wisdom because understanding and following the teachings of Allah can provide guidance and insight into how to navigate life's challenges and make decisions. The Quran is believed to be the ultimate source of guidance and wisdom, with verses that provide solutions to various issues and offer lessons that can help individuals make wise choices.

By actively listening to God through recitation and reflection on the Quran, Muslims can deepen their understanding of their faith, values, and ethics. This process of internalizing and living out the teachings of Islam can cultivate wisdom, as individuals learn to apply these principles in their daily lives and interactions.

Furthermore, through prayer and meditation, Muslims can seek Allah's guidance and support in making decisions and facing difficult situations. This connection to the divine can provide clarity and direction, helping individuals develop a sense of inner peace and confidence in their choices.

Ultimately, the practice of listening to God in Islam is seen as a pathway to cultivating wisdom, as it involves seeking knowledge and guidance from the ultimate source of all wisdom and knowledge.
