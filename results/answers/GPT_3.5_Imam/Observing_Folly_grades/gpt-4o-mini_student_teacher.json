  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of actions categorized as folly in Islam, the response does not directly address the question from a Christian perspective based on the Bible. The concern highlighted the importance of recognizing folly in one's actions to align with God's will, which was not adequately reflected in the answer. A stronger connection to the reference answer and a clearer emphasis on Christian teachings on folly would have improved the grade."
