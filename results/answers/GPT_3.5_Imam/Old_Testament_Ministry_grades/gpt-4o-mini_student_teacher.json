  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of how priests carried out their ministry in the Old Testament temple, covering key aspects such as offering sacrifices, leading worship, teaching the people, and interceding for them. The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the practices of the Old Testament and how they can inform current ministry approaches. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly addressing how the priests ministered to God through their sacrificial service, which was the main focus of the concern provided."
