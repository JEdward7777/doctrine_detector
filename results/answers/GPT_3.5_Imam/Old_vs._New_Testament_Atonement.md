## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Old Testament, the concept of atonement revolves around the idea of offering sacrifices to make amends for sins committed. These sacrifices were an important part of the Jewish tradition and were seen as a way to seek forgiveness and restore a relationship with God. The blood of animals, such as lambs or bulls, was often used in these rituals to symbolize the cleansing of sin.

In the New Testament, the understanding of atonement shifts with the coming of Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Jesus, through his crucifixion and resurrection, served as the ultimate and perfect sacrifice for the sins of humanity. His death is seen as the ultimate atonement for the sins of all mankind, past, present, and future. This understanding emphasizes the grace, mercy, and love of God towards His creation, and the belief that through faith in Jesus, believers can be reconciled with God.

Overall, while the concept of atonement in both the Old and New Testaments involves seeking forgiveness for sins, the New Testament understanding emphasizes the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment and completion of the need for atonement.
