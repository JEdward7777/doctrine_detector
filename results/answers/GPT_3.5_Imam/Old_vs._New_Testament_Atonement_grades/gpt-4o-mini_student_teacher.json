  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. They accurately explain the Old Testament practice of sacrificial offerings for atonement and contrast it with the New Testament teaching on Jesus Christ's ultimate sacrifice as the fulfillment of atonement. The response effectively addresses the concern raised and demonstrates a clear understanding of the shift in atonement from the Old to the New Testament."
