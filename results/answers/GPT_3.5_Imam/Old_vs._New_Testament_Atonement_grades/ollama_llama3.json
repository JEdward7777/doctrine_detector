  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of explaining the concept of atonement in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the difference between temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament and Jesus' ultimate sacrifice in the New Testament. It also emphasizes the idea that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for all sins forever, which aligns with the concern about clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or biblical references to support its claims. Additionally, while it touches on the idea of God's grace and mercy in the New Testament, it could delve deeper into this aspect to provide a more nuanced understanding of the transition from Old to New Testament atonement.\n\nOverall, the response is clear and concise, but could benefit from further development and biblical support to fully address the concern."
