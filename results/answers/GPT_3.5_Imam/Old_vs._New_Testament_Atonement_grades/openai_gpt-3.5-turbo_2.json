It effectively addresses the concern raised by highlighting the significance of Christ's sacrifice as fulfilling the need for atonement once and for all. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview emphasizing the completeness and sufficiency of Jesus' sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins."
