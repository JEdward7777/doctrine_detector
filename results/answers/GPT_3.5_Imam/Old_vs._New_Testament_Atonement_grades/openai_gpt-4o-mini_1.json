The understanding of atonement in both the Old and New Testaments is effectively contrasted, highlighting the ultimate fulfillment and completion of atonement through Jesus Christ. This response aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice in reconciling believers with God."
