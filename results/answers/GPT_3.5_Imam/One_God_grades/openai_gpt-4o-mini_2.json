It appropriately addresses the concern of cultural polytheism by suggesting clear and respectful language to convey the concept of 'One God' while avoiding compromise on biblical monotheism. The inclusion of Quranic verses and hadiths to support the oneness of God in the context of Islam is a valuable addition, strengthening the overall approach to addressing the concern."
