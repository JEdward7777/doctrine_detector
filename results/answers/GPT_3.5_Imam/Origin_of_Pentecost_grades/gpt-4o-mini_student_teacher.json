  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing the historical and religious significance of the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot). They effectively connected the festival to its agricultural roots and the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai in Jewish tradition. Additionally, they made a strong connection to the events of Pentecost in the New Testament, highlighting the empowerment of the apostles by the Holy Spirit. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly referencing the provided answer from the teacher to more explicitly connect the biblical festival to its fulfillment in Christ. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
