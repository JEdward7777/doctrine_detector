It emphasizes the parallel between the Jewish festival and its fulfillment in Christ through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the early Christian believers. The response could have further elaborated on how Pentecost represents the fulfillment of the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai in Christ, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern of connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ from a Christian worldview."
