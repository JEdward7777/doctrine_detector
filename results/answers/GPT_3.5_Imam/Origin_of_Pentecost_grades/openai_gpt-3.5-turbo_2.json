It highlights the parallel between the giving of the Law to the Israelites and the empowering of the apostles by the Holy Spirit, pointing to the continuity of God's plan of redemption from the Old Testament to the New Testament. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of how the Jewish festival finds its ultimate fulfillment in Christ and the birth of the Christian Church. Great job overall."
