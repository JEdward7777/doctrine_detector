It effectively highlights the linkage between the Jewish festival and the Christian celebration of Pentecost, emphasizing the fulfillment of the festival through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon believers as described in the New Testament. The response could have further emphasized the theological understanding of Pentecost as the birth of the Christian Church and the significance of the Holy Spirit's empowerment in light of Christ's redemptive work. However, the connection between the biblical festival and its fulfillment in Christ is demonstrated well."
