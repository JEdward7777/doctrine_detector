  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately states that Jesus' followers were first called \"Christians\" in Antioch, which aligns with the given answer. Additionally, it provides a specific biblical reference (Acts 11:26) to support this claim, demonstrating an attempt to recognize historical context and significance of the term \"Christian\". While the response could be improved by providing more contextual information about the time period or cultural implications surrounding the emergence of the term \"Christian\", the overall accuracy and inclusion of relevant scripture earn a high grade."
