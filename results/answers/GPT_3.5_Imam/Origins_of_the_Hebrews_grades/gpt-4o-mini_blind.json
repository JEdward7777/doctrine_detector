From a Christian perspective, Hebrews are considered to be descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac, not his grandson Jacob. Additionally, the Christian view would emphasize the Hebrews' role in biblical narratives and their relationship with God as described in the Old Testament. The answer would be more accurate and appropriate if it addressed the biblical perspective on the Hebrews."
