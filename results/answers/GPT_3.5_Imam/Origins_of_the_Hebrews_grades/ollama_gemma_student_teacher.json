While it correctly states that the Hebrews are descendants of Prophet Ibrahim through his grandson Prophet Ya'qub (Jacob), it is inaccurate to refer to the Hebrews as a significant group in history based on Islamic perspectives. The biblical narrative of the Hebrews aligns with the traditional Jewish and Christian understanding, not the Islamic perspective."
