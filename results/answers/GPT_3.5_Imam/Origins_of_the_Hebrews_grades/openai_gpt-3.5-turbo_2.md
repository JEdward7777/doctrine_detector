In the Islamic perspective, Hebrews are considered to be descendants of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) through his grandson Prophet Ya'qub (Jacob), who was also known as Israel. They are a significant group of people in history, particularly mentioned in the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The story of the Hebrews can be found in the Quranic narratives, where they are referred to as the Children of Israel.

Comment: The response correctly identifies the Hebrews as being descendants of Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob, which aligns with the Biblical narrative. However, the response does not address the concern about the importance of understanding the heritage of the Hebrew people for grasping Biblical narratives fully. A brief explanation connecting the lineage of the Hebrews to the significance of Biblical narratives would have enhanced the response further.
