In the Islamic perspective, Hebrews are considered to be descendants of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) through his grandson Prophet Ya'qub (Jacob), who was also known as Israel. They are a significant group of people in history, particularly mentioned in the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

Comment: The response accurately states that the Hebrews are descended from Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob, which aligns with the Biblical perspective. However, the mention of Islamic beliefs and perspectives on Hebrew descent may be considered extraneous in a Christian-specific worldview. Nonetheless, the response adequately addresses the concern by highlighting the Hebrew lineage as crucial for understanding Biblical narratives.
