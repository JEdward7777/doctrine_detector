## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, the concept of pardon and forgiveness is integral to our beliefs about God's mercy and justice. Muslims believe that God is the Most Merciful and Most Forgiving, and that He pardons our sins when we sincerely repent and seek His forgiveness. We believe that God's forgiveness is a direct result of His mercy and grace, and that it is not contingent upon any intermediaries or intercessors.

Jesus Christ, as understood in Christianity, is believed to be the intercessor between humans and God for the forgiveness of sins. However, in Islam, we believe that each individual is responsible for their own actions and seeking forgiveness directly from God. We do not believe in the concept of original sin or the vicarious atonement of Jesus for the sins of humanity.

Therefore, while both Christianity and Islam emphasize the importance of forgiveness and pardon, the understanding of how this forgiveness is attained differs between the two faiths. In Islam, forgiveness is sought directly from God through sincere repentance, while in Christianity, Jesus Christ is seen as the mediator for forgiveness of sins.
