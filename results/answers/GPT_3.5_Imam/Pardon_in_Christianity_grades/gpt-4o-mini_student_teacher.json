  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation of the Islamic perspective on forgiveness and pardon, but did not effectively relate it back to the Christian concept of pardon through Jesus Christ. The response lacked depth in connecting the two beliefs and exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness as requested in the concern. The student should have focused more on comparing and contrasting the Christian and Islamic views on pardon and forgiveness within the context of the question."
