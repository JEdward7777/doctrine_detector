  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of pardon in Islam and its relationship to forgiveness. However, the response lacks specific references to Christian beliefs or the concern provided. The student correctly explains the Islamic perspective on forgiveness as direct communication with God through sincere repentance. However, the answer does not address the relationship between pardon and God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ as specified in the concern."
