However, the response could have delved deeper into the Christian understanding of pardon and divine forgiveness within the context of the New Covenant and how it ties into God's nature of justice and mercy. Additionally, addressing how divine forgiveness is tied to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
