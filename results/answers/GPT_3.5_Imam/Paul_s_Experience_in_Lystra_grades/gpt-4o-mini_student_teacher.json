  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer is well-written, but the main concern is that the student interpreted the story from a Muslim perspective instead of a Christian one. While some points may be applicable generally, they do not align with the specific Christian worldview being evaluated in this context. The student did not address the core Christian teachings of persevering in faith and ministry in difficult circumstances, which was the focus of the concern."
