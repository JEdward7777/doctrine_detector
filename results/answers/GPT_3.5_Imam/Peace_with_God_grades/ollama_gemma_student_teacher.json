  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Islamic perspective on achieving peace with God. However, it does not address the specific concern of the prompt, which relates to the role of faith in Jesus' sacrifice in achieving peace with God according to scripture. The answer also includes incorrect information regarding Christianity, claiming that Islam does not believe in Jesus' sacrifice for atonement. This undermines the overall credibility of the response."
