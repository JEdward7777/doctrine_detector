For Muslims, the concept of purification from sin is central to our faith as well. In Islam, we believe that seeking forgiveness and repentance from Allah is the key to purifying oneself from sins. Repentance involves acknowledging one's mistakes, feeling remorse for committing those sins, resolving not to repeat them, and asking for forgiveness from Allah.

Muslims are encouraged to seek purification constantly through sincere repentance, performing acts of worship, and engaging in good deeds. We believe that Allah is the Most Merciful and Forgiving, and He accepts the repentance of His servants who turn to Him with sincerity.

It is important for Christians and Muslims alike to strive for spiritual purification and closeness to God through seeking forgiveness, performing good deeds, and striving to lead a righteous life.
