  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer is relevant to the question and addresses the concern. However, it is not specific to Christian beliefs and practices. The student correctly describes the concept of purification from sin in Islam, but fails to connect it specifically to Christianity. The answer would be more appropriate for a question about the concept of purification in different religions rather than one specifically focusing on Christianity."
