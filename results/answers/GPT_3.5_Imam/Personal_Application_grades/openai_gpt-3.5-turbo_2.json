The focus on seeking forgiveness from God and the belief in His mercy and forgiveness is shared by both faith traditions. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the personal implications of seeking purification for one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. It acknowledges the parallel values of leading a righteous life in both Christianity and Islam."
