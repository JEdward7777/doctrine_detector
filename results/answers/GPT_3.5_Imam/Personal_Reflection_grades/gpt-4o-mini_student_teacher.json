  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a fair explanation of the expression \"woe is me\" as conveying a sense of remorse and distress about one's own suffering or sin. However, the student did not directly address the concern of encouraging personal reflection on one's own spiritual state and awareness of sin, which is important in a Christian worldview. The student also referenced an Islamic perspective instead of a Christian one. Therefore, the grade is lower as the answer missed the mark in addressing the concern from a Christian-specific worldview."
