It correctly highlights the conflict between Jesus' teachings and the Pharisees' practices and beliefs, leading to opposition and persecution. The answer could be improved by incorporating more direct references to specific biblical passages where Jesus confronted the Pharisees, showcasing the doctrinal roots of the disagreements. Additionally, emphasizing Jesus' fulfillment of the Law as opposed to mere criticism of the Pharisees would provide a deeper theological insight into the relationship dynamics."
