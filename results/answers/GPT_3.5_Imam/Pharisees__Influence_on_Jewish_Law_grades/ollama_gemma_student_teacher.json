  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the conflict between the Pharisees and Jesus, as well as the tension between the Pharisees and early Christians. The response clearly explains how the Pharisees' adherence to the Laws of Moses created barriers to their understanding and acceptance of Jesus and his teachings. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific ethical and theological implications of the Pharisees' legalistic approach."
