It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how the Pharisees' focus on the letter of the law rather than its spirit created conflicts with Jesus, who emphasized the inner spiritual transformation. The integration of Christian worldview principles, such as the importance of genuine righteousness and love, enhances the analysis. Additionally, the response succinctly explains the role of the Pharisees in the challenges faced by Jesus in his ministry."
