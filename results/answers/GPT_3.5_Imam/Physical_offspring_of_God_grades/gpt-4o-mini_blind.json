  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student did a decent job explaining the Islamic perspective on the term \"Son of God\" and emphasizing the metaphorical understanding within Islam. However, the response fell short in providing a Christian-specific perspective on clarifying the term for someone who believes it implies physical offspring of God. It would have been more effective to address this misconception through the lens of Christian theology, emphasizing concepts such as the eternal Sonship of Jesus and the Trinitarian nature of God. The student should have incorporated more Christian doctrinal explanations to provide a comprehensive answer."
