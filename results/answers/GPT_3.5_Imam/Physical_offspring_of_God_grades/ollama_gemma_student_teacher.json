  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the theological significance of the term \"Son of God\" within an Islamic perspective. They effectively address the misconception of physical offspring and clearly explain the metaphorical relationship between Jesus and God. Additionally, the student provides a solid explanation of the doctrinal differences between Islam and other faith traditions regarding polytheism and the oneness of God. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific theological interpretations and scriptural references within Islam that support the metaphorical understanding of the \"Son of God\" concept."
