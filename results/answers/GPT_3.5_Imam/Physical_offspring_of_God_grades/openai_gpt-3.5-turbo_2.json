It upholds the importance of proper teaching to prevent doctrinal errors and retains the biblical terminology by providing a theological comparison between Islam and other faith traditions. However, the response could be enhanced by directly incorporating the given answer more explicitly within the explanation to strengthen the connection between the Christian belief in Jesus' divine nature and the explanation within an Islamic context."
