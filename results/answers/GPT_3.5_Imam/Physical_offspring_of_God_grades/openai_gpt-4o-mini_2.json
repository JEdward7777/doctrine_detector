It correctly teaches that 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation, while highlighting theological and doctrinal differences. However, it could have emphasized more biblical terminology to strengthen the Christian perspective and better differentiate it from Islamic beliefs."
