  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 75.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the question and provides a well-structured response that distinguishes between physical death and spiritual perishing in Islamic teachings.\n2. The explanation of physical death and spiritual perishing is articulated coherently and effectively.\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n1. The response would benefit from a stronger emphasis on the importance of spiritual salvation through faith in Islam, rather than simply focusing on physical death and spiritual disconnect.\n2. It would be beneficial to include references to specific Islamic teachings or scriptures to further support and substantiate the explanation provided.\n\nOverall, the student shows a good grasp of the topic but could enhance the depth of their response by incorporating more theological insights and textual references to strengthen their argument."
