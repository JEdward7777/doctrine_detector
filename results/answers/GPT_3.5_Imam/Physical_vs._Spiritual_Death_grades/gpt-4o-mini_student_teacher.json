  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of physical death and spiritual perishing in the context of Islam, emphasizing the spiritual disconnect from Allah. However, the response did not align with the Christian perspective provided by the teacher, which focuses on the eternal consequences of not trusting in Jesus for spiritual perishing. The student should have addressed the Christian viewpoint to fully address the concern raised in the question."
