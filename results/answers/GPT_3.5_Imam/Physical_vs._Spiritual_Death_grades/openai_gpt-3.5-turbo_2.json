  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively clarifies the distinction between physical and spiritual death from an Islamic perspective and provides a well-reasoned explanation. It appropriately addresses the concern raised by emphasizing the eternal consequences related to spiritual perishing and offers a clear perspective while incorporating the Christian view presented in the given answer. It could have further emphasized the unique significance of trust in Jesus for Christians in contrast to the Islamic perspective but overall, it provides a strong analysis from a Christian-specific worldview."
