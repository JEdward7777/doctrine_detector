  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the distinction between physical death and spiritual death in Islamic teachings, addressing the concern raised about clarifying this distinction. The explanation is thorough and well-articulated from an Islamic perspective. However, it would have been beneficial to offer a Christian perspective on the concept of spiritual death for comparison and contrast, as suggested in the answer provided. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern and presents the information in a coherent manner."
