It highlights key aspects such as gathering for worship, sharing meals, praying, studying scripture, mutual support, and the sharing of possessions. The emphasis on unity, care, and love among the early Christian community is also well articulated. These practices can indeed serve as a model for contemporary Christians to deepen their connections with one another. Overall, a solid response with a strong Christian worldview perspective."
