  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of calling out to a higher power in prayer and the importance of sincerity, humility, and trust. However, the response reflects Islamic beliefs and references Allah instead of the Christian understanding of calling out to the Lord. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate Christian theology and terminology when discussing prayer and calling out to God."
