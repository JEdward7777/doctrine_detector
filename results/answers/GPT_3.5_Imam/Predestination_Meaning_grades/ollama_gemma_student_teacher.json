  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately defines the concept of predestination in a Christian context. It correctly states that predestination refers to God's predetermination of events, including the eternal fate of individuals, before the beginning of time. The student also provides relevant biblical references to support their claim. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the theological debates surrounding the doctrine of predestination and its implications for Christian beliefs and practices."
