In Christian theology, the term "predestine" refers to the belief that God has predetermined or foreordained all events, including the eternal fate of individuals, before the beginning of time. This doctrine is often associated with the concept of divine sovereignty and is a topic of theological debate among Christians. It is based on verses from the Bible, such as Romans 8:29-30 and Ephesians 1:5, which speak about God's foreknowledge and predestination of those whom He has chosen for salvation.
