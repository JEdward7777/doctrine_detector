It correctly emphasizes God's role in determining beforehand the eternal fate of individuals, aligning well with Christian beliefs about divine sovereignty and predestination. The response effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological concept within the context of Christian theology. Great job!"
