## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we do not believe in the concept of humans being "adopted children of God" in the Christian sense. Rather, we believe that all individuals are servants of Allah and created by Him. It is through belief in and submission to Allah that we fulfill our purpose in this world.

That being said, in Islam, all believers are considered to be close to Allah and can attain a special relationship with Him through faith and worship. The Qur'an often refers to believers as "servants of Allah" and promises them His guidance, mercy, forgiveness, and ultimately Paradise if they adhere to His commandments and follow the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

So, in Islam, the "privileges" that believers receive include guidance in this world, the promise of forgiveness and mercy from Allah, and the hope of eternal paradise in the hereafter. These privileges are not based on adoption, but rather on sincere faith and submission to the will of Allah.
