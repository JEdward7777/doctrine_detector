However, the answer fails to address the specific question about privileges of adopted children of God as mentioned in Romans 8:14-15. It would have been beneficial to briefly acknowledge the Christian perspective on adoption as children of God and then provide an Islamic perspective on the concept of privilege or special relationship with Allah. This response lacks direct engagement with the Christian context presented in the question."
