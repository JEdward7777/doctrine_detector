However, the response falls short in recognizing the depth of the relationship between believers and God.\n\nWhile it mentions that believers are considered close to Allah and can attain a special relationship with Him through faith and worship, it does not fully explore or emphasize the intimacy and personal nature of this relationship. The concern about recognizing the depth of the relationship is only partially addressed, leaving room for further development and nuance."
