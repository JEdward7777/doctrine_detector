However, it lacks a direct comparison to the depth of the relationship between believers and God as described in the Christian context. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the closeness and privileges that believers in Islam can receive from Allah, but could have further explored the depth of this relationship in relation to the Christian understanding of being adopted children of God."
