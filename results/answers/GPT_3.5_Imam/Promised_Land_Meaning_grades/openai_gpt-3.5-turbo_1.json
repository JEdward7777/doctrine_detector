However, the response primarily draws from Islamic scripture (the Quran) to discuss this Christian-specific concept, which may not fully address the concern of understanding the biblical significance. While there is some overlap in the narratives between Islam and Christianity regarding Abraham, a more comprehensive examination of the biblical context and significance would strengthen the response."
