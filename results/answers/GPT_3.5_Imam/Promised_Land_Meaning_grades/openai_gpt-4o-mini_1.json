The references to Quranic verses help shed light on the Islamic perspective. However, the response does not explicitly address the biblical significance of God's promises to Abraham and his lineage, which was the specified concern. It would have been stronger if it had connected the Islamic perspective to the biblical narrative to show the understanding from a Christian worldview."
