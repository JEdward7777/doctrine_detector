  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response effectively conveys that the term \"Daughter of Zion\" is used to refer to Israel or Jerusalem in prophetic texts, and that it often carries messages of hope or warning. However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples from prophetic texts to illustrate its point, and exploring the deeper meaning and significance of this term within its historical context.\n\nIn terms of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context, the response demonstrates a basic understanding that these prophecies have a special significance. However, it could be further developed by providing more insight into the cultural and historical background in which these prophecies were written, and how this informs our interpretation and application of these texts today.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some good information, it could benefit from more depth and analysis to truly demonstrate an understanding of the prophetic nature of terms like \"Daughter of Zion\"."
