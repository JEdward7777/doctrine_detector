  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nWhile the student's response provides insightful information about protective desire within Islamic marriage, it does not directly address the Christian perspective as requested in the prompt. The answer fails to connect the concept of protective desire with Christian teachings or principles. Additionally, the response is not relevant to the specific concern expressed in the prompt, which focuses on applying the concept of protective desire within Christian relationships."
