  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a good job of highlighting the importance of seeking guidance from a higher power (Allah) in discerning one's purpose, which aligns well with the concern about finding clarity and direction. The response also touches on the value of self-reflection, knowledge-seeking, and serving others in fulfilling one's calling.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not explicitly mention prayer or seeking guidance from God as a means of discerning one's purpose, which is mentioned in the target answer. Additionally, while the response does touch on the importance of faith and spiritual guidance, it could have been more explicit in emphasizing the role of God's guidance in fulfilling His purpose.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of discerning one's calling and provides some practical advice for doing so. While it could be improved by explicitly mentioning prayer and seeking divine guidance, it still offers a helpful framework for individuals seeking to understand and fulfill their purpose."
