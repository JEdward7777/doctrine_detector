  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive and well-structured approach from an Islamic perspective on discerning one's calling and purpose, which aligns closely with the Christian concern of finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life. The emphasis on seeking knowledge, reflecting on abilities, seeking divine guidance, serving humanity, and consulting with others resonates with Christian teachings on discernment and following God's will. However, the slight deviation from the Christian framework in referencing Islamic beliefs and practices is the reason for deducting some points from the grade. Nonetheless, the core principles discussed in the response are applicable and valuable for Christians seeking to discern their calling as well."
