The emphasis on incorporating Islamic principles and practices aligns well with the concern of finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life. The response could be strengthened by explicitly mentioning the importance of prayer, studying Scripture, and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, in addition to the Islamic perspectives shared."
