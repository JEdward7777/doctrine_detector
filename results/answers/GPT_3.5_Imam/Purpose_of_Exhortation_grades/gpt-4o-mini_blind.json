  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of exhortation from an Islamic perspective, the response did not address the primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament. The focus on Islamic teachings, while informative, deviated from the Christian-specific worldview of the question. The grading considers doctrinal correctness, and in this case, the lack of alignment with New Testament teachings significantly impacted the grade."
