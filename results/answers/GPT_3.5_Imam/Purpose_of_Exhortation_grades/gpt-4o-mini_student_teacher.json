The answer does not align with the reference answer, which emphasizes persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will as the primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament. The student's perspective, while informative, does not directly address the concern of understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey from a Christian worldview."
