  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the response provides some insightful information about exhortation from an Islamic perspective, it does not specifically address the concern of understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. The provided answer also lacks direct correlation with the specified concern, as it primarily focuses on the concept of exhortation in Islam rather than exploring its biblical roots. However, the response does demonstrate some recognition of the importance of exhortation in promoting moral uprightness and good behavior among believers. To improve, the response could have incorporated more biblical references or explanations to address the specified concern."
