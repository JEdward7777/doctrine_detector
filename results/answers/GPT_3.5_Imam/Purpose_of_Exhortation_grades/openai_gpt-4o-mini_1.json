While the response effectively discusses the importance and methods of exhortation within Islam, it lacks specific references to the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of exhortation as a concept but could benefit from more explicit connections to the biblical perspective on this topic."
