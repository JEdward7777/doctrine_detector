The answer does not directly reference Christian beliefs, practices, or the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification, which is crucial in understanding holiness within a Christian context. The response should have focused more on Christian teachings, scriptures, and practices that guide believers in living a life set apart for God's purpose."
