While there are some universal principles shared among faith traditions, true holiness in Christianity is centered on faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, obedience to His teachings, and transformation through the Holy Spirit. Additionally, the response does not directly address the concern of practical application of holiness in a believer's life from a Christian perspective."
