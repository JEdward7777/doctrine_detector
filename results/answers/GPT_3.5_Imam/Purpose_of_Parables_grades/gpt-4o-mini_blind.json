It lacks doctrinal correctness in its understanding of Jesus as the Son of God and the unique purpose of his parables in Christianity. The response also does not mention the concept of the Kingdom of God, which is foundational to understanding the significance of Jesus' parables in Christian teachings. In a Christian worldview, Jesus used parables not only to convey moral lessons but also to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of God to those who have ears to hear."
