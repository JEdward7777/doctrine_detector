  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60. \n\nWhile the student's response accurately describes the general purpose of parables in conveying spiritual and moral lessons, there is a significant divergence from a Christian worldview perspective. The student's answer focuses on the Islamic perspective of Jesus and parables, which may not align with Christian beliefs. Additionally, the student overlooks the aspect of Jesus using parables to reveal truths to his disciples while concealing the deeper meaning from those who did not believe, as highlighted in the reference answer. \n\nThe Christian-specific worldview emphasizes the dual purpose of parables: to enlighten and challenge believers while simultaneously concealing deeper truths from unbelievers. Thus, the student's answer, although well-written and informative from an Islamic perspective, lacks the Christian-centric understanding of Jesus's use of parables."
