It acknowledges the deeper significance of Jesus' use of parables to reveal truth to believers while concealing it from those who lack faith. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the implications of Jesus' teaching methods on faith. A Christian perspective would likely emphasize even more strongly the spiritual discernment involved in understanding and applying Jesus' teachings, but overall, this response demonstrates a solid grasp of the subject matter."
