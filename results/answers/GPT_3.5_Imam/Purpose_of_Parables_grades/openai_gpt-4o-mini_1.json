However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it lacks the critical element of acknowledging the divinity of Jesus and the significance of his teachings in revealing the truth of God's kingdom to all people, not just his disciples. It is important to highlight the unique role of Jesus as the Son of God and Savior of humanity, as this aspect is fundamental to understanding the implications of his teachings on faith."
