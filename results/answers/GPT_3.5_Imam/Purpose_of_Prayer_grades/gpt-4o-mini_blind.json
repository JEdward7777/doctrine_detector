However, since the question specifically asks for purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible, the answer is not directly addressing the Christian perspective, which is the primary focus of the question. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, there are distinct differences in the beliefs surrounding prayer between Islam and Christianity. The response would be more accurate if it focused on the Christian perspective as outlined in the Bible."
