  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the purposes of prayer in Islam, the answer did not directly address the question about the key purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible. It is important to stay focused on the specific concerns raised in the question to provide a relevant response. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, the key purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible emphasize seeking God's mercy, wisdom, confessing sins, giving thanks, and interceding for others, which were not fully addressed in the student's response related to Islam."
