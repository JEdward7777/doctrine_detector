It effectively recognizes the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life. However, it could have further emphasized the distinct Islamic perspective and the unique teachings of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in relation to prayer, which would have enhanced the overall understanding of prayer within an Islamic context."
