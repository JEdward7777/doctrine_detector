  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-structured answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the role of the Psalms in the worship practices of the nation of Israel. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the historical context and purpose of worship through Psalms, as the specific concern requested. Additionally, the answer could have emphasized more on the expression of emotions such as joy, faith, reverence, pain, and sorrow as highlighted in the reference answer."
