  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer from an Islamic perspective regarding the purpose of tests that believers experience. However, from a Christian worldview, the focus is on tests revealing sin, leading believers to repentance, and fostering a closer relationship with God. While the student's answer is insightful and well-supported, it does not directly address the concern of how understanding the nature of tests can impact a believer's response to difficult circumstances from a Christian perspective."
