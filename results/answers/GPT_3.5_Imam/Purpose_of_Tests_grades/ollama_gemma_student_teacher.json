  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Islamic perspective on tests and trials. However, it does not fully align with the Christian specific worldview as referenced in the concern. The Christian perspective emphasizes the exposure of sin as a purpose of tests, which is not explicitly mentioned in the student's response."
