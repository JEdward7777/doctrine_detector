  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated response from an Islamic perspective on the relationship between the soul and God, demonstrating an understanding of the spiritual significance of the soul in Islam. However, the student could improve their grade by directly addressing the concern provided, which focuses on how recognizing the soul's role in relation to God can influence a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. The response could have been enhanced by explicitly connecting the impact of the soul's relationship with God to spiritual growth and moral decision-making."
