Christians believe that Jesus was not only a prophet and a messenger of God, but also the Son of God and the Savior of humanity. Therefore, the title of "Rabbi" is used to acknowledge his authority, wisdom, and role as a teacher in Christian faith.

Comments: The answer provides a generally accurate explanation of how the term "Rabbi" is understood in Christian teachings. It correctly identifies Jesus as the primary referent of the title, highlighting his authority, wisdom, and role as a teacher. However, it could have been strengthened by mentioning the Jewish context of the title "Rabbi" and how it relates to Jesus' interactions with his disciples and the Jewish religious leaders of his time. Including this additional historical and cultural context would have further enriched the answer.
