  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the term \"Rabbi\" in the context of Christian teaching. However, there is a concern in the accuracy of the information provided, as the student's answer does not fully address the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. The student correctly explains the meaning of \"Rabbi\" as teacher or master in Hebrew, but falls short in connecting this to the broader understanding of rabbinic teaching within the New Testament context. Further explanation on how rabbinic teachings influenced Jesus' ministry and his interactions with Jewish religious leaders in the New Testament would strengthen the response."
