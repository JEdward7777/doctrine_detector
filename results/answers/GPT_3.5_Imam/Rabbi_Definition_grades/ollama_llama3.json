  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by explaining that \"Rabbi\" means \"teacher\" or \"master,\" which is accurate. However, it does not fully address the concern as it only mentions Jesus Christ and does not explicitly discuss the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. The response also lacks biblical references to support its claims.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response should have more thoroughly addressed the concern by discussing how Jesus' teachings in the New Testament were influenced by Jewish rabbinic traditions and how he fulfilled or modified these traditions. Additionally, the response could have provided more scriptural evidence to support its claims about Jesus being referred to as \"Rabbi.\""
