The explanation effectively addresses the concern regarding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament from a Christian worldview. The only improvement would be to elaborate further on how Jesus' role as a rabbi aligns with or diverges from traditional rabbinic teaching in Judaism."
