However, the answer does not address the concern of understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. While the response provides insight into the Christian perspective of Jesus Christ as a Rabbi, it does not directly connect this understanding to the broader context of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament."
