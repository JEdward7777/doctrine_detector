  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the Temple in Jerusalem, they did not address the specific historical events that led to its destruction and subsequent rebuilding as per the teacher's reference answer. It is important to focus on the historical context and significance of the temple's destruction and restoration, which was missing in the student's response. The student's answer, while informative from an Islamic worldview, did not directly answer the question with the required historical events to receive a higher grade in this context."
