However, the focus on Islam is not necessary for this question, which specifically asks for a comparison within the context of the Bible and ancient Israel. The answer would have been stronger if it had delved deeper into the biblical principles of redemption and how they relate to the Old Testament practices, without bringing in comparisons to Islamic beliefs."
