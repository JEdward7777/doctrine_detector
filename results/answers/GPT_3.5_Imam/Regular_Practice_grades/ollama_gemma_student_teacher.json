  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 0/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is clearly irrelevant to the question as it expresses a Muslim perspective and does not address the Christian belief in the Lord's Supper. The student's response fails to provide any information regarding Paul's establishment of the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers."
