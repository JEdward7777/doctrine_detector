## Question [Regular Practice](../../../questions/Regular_Practice.md)

## Correct Answer
The apostle Paul established the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers to remember and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of the Lord’s Supper in the life of the church and individual believers.

## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we do not believe in the teachings of the Apostle Paul or the concept of the Lord's Supper as practiced in Christianity. However, in Islam, we have the tradition of breaking bread together as a symbol of unity and brotherhood. Just as the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of sharing meals and hospitality with others, the act of breaking bread can serve as a reminder of the blessings from Allah and the importance of community and solidarity among believers.

**Comment:** The student's answer is clearly irrelevant to the question as it expresses a Muslim perspective and does not address the Christian belief in the Lord's Supper. The student's response fails to provide any information regarding Paul's establishment of the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers.
