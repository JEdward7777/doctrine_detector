  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided by the student, although respectful towards the Muslim perspective, does not adequately address the concern raised about the importance of the Lord's Supper in Christianity. The student's answer focuses on Islamic traditions related to breaking bread but fails to engage with the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian belief and practice. More consideration of the Christian worldview and the specific concern raised would have strengthened the response."
