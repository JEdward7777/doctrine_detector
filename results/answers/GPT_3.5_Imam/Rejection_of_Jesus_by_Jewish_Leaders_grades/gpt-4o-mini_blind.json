The emphasis on Islamic beliefs and the downplaying of the Christian significance of Jesus as the Son of God and the sacrifice for the atonement of sins detracts from the Christian perspective on this crucial event. The answer could benefit from focusing more on the Christian interpretation of Jesus' rejection and its implications for Christian beliefs."
