  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on atonement and propitiation. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of clarifying the differences and similarities between the two terms as specified. The student correctly highlights the distinct Christian belief in propitiation as appeasing God's wrath through Jesus Christ's sacrifice, but could have elaborated more on the relationship between propitiation and atonement within Christian theology. Additionally, the answer could have been strengthened by referencing Biblical passages or theological insights to support the Christian perspective on propitiation and atonement."
