## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, there is no concept of the twelve apostles as mentioned in Christian teachings. Muslims believe in the disciples of Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, but do not have the same emphasis on the specific number or names of these disciples as found in the Christian tradition. The focus in Islam is on the message of all the Prophets, including Prophet Isa, and the importance of following the teachings of all the Prophets, rather than the specific details surrounding certain individuals.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: While the response acknowledges differences in beliefs between Islam and Christianity regarding the twelve apostles, it fails to directly address the question asked. A correct Christian perspective on this matter would involve discussing the selection of Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot, as recorded in Acts 1:15-26. The response also does not provide any insight into the Christian understanding of the importance and role of the twelve apostles in the early Church.
