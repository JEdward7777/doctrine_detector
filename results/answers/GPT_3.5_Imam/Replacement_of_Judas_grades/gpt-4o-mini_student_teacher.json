  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's response does not address the question about who was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles from a Christian perspective. The answer provided focuses on Islamic beliefs and teachings concerning Prophet Isa (Jesus) rather than providing the relevant information about Matthias being chosen as Judas' replacement. The student's response does not align with the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, as it is not related to the specific event of selecting a replacement apostle."
