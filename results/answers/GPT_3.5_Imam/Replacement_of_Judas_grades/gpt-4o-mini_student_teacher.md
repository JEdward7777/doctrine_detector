## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, there is no concept of the twelve apostles as mentioned in Christian teachings. Muslims believe in the disciples of Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, but do not have the same emphasis on the specific number or names of these disciples as found in the Christian tradition. The focus in Islam is on the message of all the Prophets, including Prophet Isa, and the importance of following the teachings of all the Prophets, rather than the specific details surrounding certain individuals.

Grade: 10

Comment: The student's response does not address the question about who was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles from a Christian perspective. The answer provided focuses on Islamic beliefs and teachings concerning Prophet Isa (Jesus) rather than providing the relevant information about Matthias being chosen as Judas' replacement. The student's response does not align with the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, as it is not related to the specific event of selecting a replacement apostle.
