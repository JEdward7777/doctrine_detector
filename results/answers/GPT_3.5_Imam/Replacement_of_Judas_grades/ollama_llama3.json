  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does not directly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, it does provide some insight into the Islamic perspective on the disciples of Prophet Isa (Jesus). The response acknowledges that Muslims do not have the same emphasis on the specific number or names of these disciples as found in the Christian tradition, which is relevant to the concern.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern and providing more information about how the Islamic tradition views the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The response also does not specifically mention Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, which is the main point mentioned in the provided answer.\n\nComment: While this response provides some useful information on the Islamic perspective, it could be more effective in addressing the concern by providing a direct comparison or contrast between Christian and Islamic views on apostolic leadership."
