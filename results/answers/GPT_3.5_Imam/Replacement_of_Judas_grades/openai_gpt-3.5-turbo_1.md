## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, there is no concept of the twelve apostles as mentioned in Christian teachings. Muslims believe in the disciples of Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, but do not have the same emphasis on the specific number or names of these disciples as found in the Christian tradition. The focus in Islam is on the message of all the Prophets, including Prophet Isa, and the importance of following the teachings of all the Prophets, rather than the specific details surrounding certain individuals.
