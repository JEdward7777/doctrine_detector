## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, there is no concept of the twelve apostles as mentioned in Christian teachings. Muslims believe in the disciples of Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, but do not have the same emphasis on the specific number or names of these disciples as found in the Christian tradition. The focus in Islam is on the message of all the Prophets, including Prophet Isa, and the importance of following the teachings of all the Prophets, rather than the specific details surrounding certain individuals.

Comment: The response accurately discusses the replacement of Judas Iscariot with Matthias in the apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, aligning with Christian teachings on this specific event. However, there could have been more emphasis on the significance of this continuity of apostolic leadership within the Christian faith, highlighting the importance of maintaining the authority and mission entrusted by Jesus to His apostles.
