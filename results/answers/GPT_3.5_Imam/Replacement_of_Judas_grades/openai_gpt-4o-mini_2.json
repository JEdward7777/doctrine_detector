  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response accurately states the Christian belief regarding Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, demonstrating a solid understanding of apostolic succession in Christianity. However, the response did not directly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, which is a key aspect of the Christian faith. A stronger connection between the response and the concern would have improved the overall grade."
