## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, there is no concept of the twelve apostles as mentioned in Christian teachings. Muslims believe in the disciples of Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, but do not have the same emphasis on the specific number or names of these disciples as found in the Christian tradition. The focus in Islam is on the message of all the Prophets, including Prophet Isa, and the importance of following the teachings of all the Prophets, rather than the specific details surrounding certain individuals.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 75

Comment: The response accurately states the Christian belief regarding Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, demonstrating a solid understanding of apostolic succession in Christianity. However, the response did not directly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, which is a key aspect of the Christian faith. A stronger connection between the response and the concern would have improved the overall grade.
