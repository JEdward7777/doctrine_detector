  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive overview of the Christian perspective on salvation, including faith in Jesus Christ, belief in his death and resurrection, repentance, confessing sins, and following Jesus' teachings. However, the answer is lacking in specificity and clarity compared to the reference answer, which succinctly states that repentance of sins and belief in Jesus are the requirements for salvation according to the Bible. The student's response could be improved by focusing on the core biblical requirements for salvation without unnecessary details or comparisons to Islam."
