  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and the crucifixion, the answer does not address the specific Christian perspective on Peter addressing the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. The answer does not engage with the reference answer provided by the teacher or evaluate the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel from a Christian worldview perspective. The response focuses solely on Islamic beliefs, missing the key aspect of the question that requires a Christian-specific analysis."
