  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian belief in the resurrection, emphasizing Jesus' resurrection as central to the faith and connecting it to believers' hope for eternal life. However, the student slightly missed the mark on explicitly mentioning that resurrection is the act of becoming alive again after death through God's power, as exemplified by Jesus. This response could have been improved by incorporating a more precise definition of resurrection in a Christian context as outlined in the reference answer."
