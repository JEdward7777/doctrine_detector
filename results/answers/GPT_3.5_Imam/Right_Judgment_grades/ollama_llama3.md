## [Answer](../Right_Judgment.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, the concept of judging others is guided by the teachings of the Quran and the sayings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Luke 6:37, from the Christian Bible, shares a similar message of refraining from judging others and emphasizes the importance of showing mercy and forgiveness.

As Muslims, we are taught to be cautious when judging others, as only Allah has the ultimate authority to judge. The Quran states in Chapter 4, Verse 135: "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of both. So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse [to give it], then indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted."

This verse reminds us to be just and fair in our judgments, even if it means speaking against ourselves or loved ones. It also emphasizes the importance of being truthful and impartial in our assessments.

In light of the concept of condemnation, Islam teaches us to be cautious and merciful in our judgments. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales. Do not look for others' faults, and do not spy, and do not be jealous of one another, and do not desert (cut your relation with) one another, and do not hate one another; rather, be servants of Allah as brothers."

Therefore, as Muslims, we should approach judging others with caution, fairness, and compassion, always seeking to uphold justice and avoid condemnation.
