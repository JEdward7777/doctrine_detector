The inclusion of relevant verses from both the Quran and the Bible, along with teachings of Prophet Muhammad, highlights the importance of showing mercy, refraining from harsh judgment, and upholding justice. The response effectively addresses the concern with a Christian-specific worldview while drawing parallels between the two faith traditions. Great job!"
