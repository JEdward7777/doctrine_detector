  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful comparison between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding God's attributes, but the answer focused more on the concept of God's wrath in Islam rather than addressing how Christians reconcile it with His nature as loving and merciful. The student did mention the connection between God's wrath and His love and mercy, but could have delved deeper into how Christians specifically understand this reconciliation within the context of Biblical teaching."
