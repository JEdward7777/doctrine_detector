In Islamic theology, angels are considered to be purely spiritual beings created by God to serve Him in various ways. They do not have free will and always obey God's commands without question. Some of the primary ways in which angels serve God include:

1. Worship: Angels are constantly engaged in worshiping and glorifying God. They never tire of praising Him and carrying out acts of worship.
 
2. Acting as Messengers: Angels are often sent by God to deliver messages to His prophets and convey His commands to humanity. For example, the Angel Jibril (Gabriel) was sent to deliver revelations to Prophets such as Muhammad (peace be upon him).

3. Recording Deeds: According to Islamic belief, each person has two angels assigned to them who record their deeds, whether good or bad. These records will be presented on the Day of Judgment.

4. Protection: Angels are believed to protect and guide believers, providing them with support and assistance in times of need. They are also present during moments of hardship and death to comfort and guide believers.

5. Executing God's Will: Angels play a role in carrying out God's commands and enforcing His will on earth. For example, the Angel of Death is responsible for taking the souls of people when their time comes.

Overall, angels serve as a means through which God interacts with His creation and carries out His divine plan. They are considered to be beings of light and mercy, constantly working to uphold the will of God.
