  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: The response provided brings insights from Islamic theology regarding angels; however, the question specifically asked for references from the Bible, not Islamic theology. The student did not focus on the biblical perspective but instead provided information based on Islamic beliefs. The reference points are inaccurate and not aligned with a Christian worldview, which is essential for answering the question accurately. The student should focus on providing biblical references and aligning the response with Christian beliefs when answering questions from a Christian-specific worldview."
