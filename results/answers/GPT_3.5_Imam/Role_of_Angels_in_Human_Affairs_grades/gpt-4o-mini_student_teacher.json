  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on angels serving God, it does not directly address the concern of how understanding these roles can impact Christian perceptions of divine intervention. The response lacks a comparison or contrast with the Christian view on angels serving God, which is essential for addressing the given concern from a Christian worldview. Further integration of Biblical references and Christian beliefs would have strengthened the answer."
