  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a basic understanding of the roles of angels in Islamic theology but does not directly address how understanding these roles can impact how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives. It lacks depth in connecting the Islamic perspective on angels to the concern raised from a Christian worldview. More explicit connections and explanations would have strengthened the response and improved the grade."
