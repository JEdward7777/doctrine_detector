It does not directly address the concern raised regarding Christian perceptions of divine intervention. To improve, the response could provide more detailed examples and explanations related to angelic roles in delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening believers, and communicating on behalf of God. Additionally, it should address how understanding these roles might influence Christian beliefs about divine intervention."
