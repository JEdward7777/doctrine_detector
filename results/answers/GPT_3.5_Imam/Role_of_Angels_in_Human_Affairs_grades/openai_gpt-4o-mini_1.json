  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a decent overview of the roles of angels in Islamic theology, highlighting their service to God in worship, message delivery, recording deeds, protection, and executing God's will. However, there is a lack of explicit connection to the concern raised about how understanding these roles of angels can impact Christian perceptions of divine intervention. To improve the grade, more explicit comparisons or contrasts between Islamic and Christian beliefs about angels and divine intervention would have been beneficial."
