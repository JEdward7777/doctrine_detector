  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a brief summary of Islamic beliefs regarding angels' roles in serving God, but it lacks depth and fails to address the concern raised about Christian perceptions of divine intervention. While the response mentions some functions of angels such as delivering messages and providing protection, it does not address the broader theological implications for Christians or how understanding these roles might impact their faith and perception of divine intervention. To improve the grade, the response should delve into the distinct Christian perspective on angels and their roles in divine intervention."
