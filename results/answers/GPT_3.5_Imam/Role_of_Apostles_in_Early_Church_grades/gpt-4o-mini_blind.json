  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student's response is inaccurate and misleading as it refers to the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers in the context of Islam instead of Christianity. The apostles mentioned in the question are those from the New Testament who followed Jesus Christ, not in Islam. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and does not align with a Christian-specific worldview. The student should focus on accurately interpreting the apostles' actions within the Christian context in future responses."
