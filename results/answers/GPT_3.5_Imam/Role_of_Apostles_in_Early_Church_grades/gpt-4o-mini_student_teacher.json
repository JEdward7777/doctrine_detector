  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant insights on unity, knowledge, and leading by example, but the response focused more on teachings from Islam rather than the actions of the apostles in fostering community among believers in a Christian context. The answer did not directly address the importance of fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer as modeled by the apostles, which are crucial aspects of community building within the early church. The student could improve by linking their points more explicitly to the actions of the apostles as outlined in the reference answer."
