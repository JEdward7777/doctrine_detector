  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of community and teaching as modeled by the apostles, but it falls short in directly addressing the concern. While the response highlights the importance of unity, knowledge, and example-setting, it does not explicitly connect these aspects to the early Christian church or the apostles' teachings. Additionally, some minor errors in terminology (e.g., referring to a \"Muslim community\" when discussing the early Christian church) detract from the overall grade.\n\nThe response shows some connection to the concern by highlighting the importance of teaching and community-building, but it could be strengthened by more directly addressing the apostles' example and its relevance to building a strong and supportive Christian community."
