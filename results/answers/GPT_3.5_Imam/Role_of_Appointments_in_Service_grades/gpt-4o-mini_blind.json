The student accurately references key verses from scripture to support their points. The emphasis on serving with sincerity, humility, and a servant's heart aligns well with Christian doctrine. One improvement could be to include a mention of the importance of prayer and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit in discerning and effectively fulfilling one's role within the Church. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound answer."
