  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how Christians are called to fulfill their roles within the Church, referencing relevant Bible verses and emphasizing the importance of serving with sincerity, humility, and love. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting believers' responsibility in their appointed tasks and service within the body of Christ. The only small improvement would be to directly mention advancing God's kingdom, as stated in the reference answer, to receive a perfect score."
