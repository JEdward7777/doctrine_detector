In the Passover event as described in the Bible, the blood played a significant role in the Hebrew tradition. The blood of the lamb was used to mark the doorposts of the homes of the Israelites in Egypt as a sign of protection and to distinguish them from the Egyptians. This act symbolized obedience to God's command and trust in His promise of deliverance.

The shedding of blood also alludes to the sacrificial system present in the Israelite religious practices. The offering of the lamb as a sacrifice and the application of its blood served as a means of atonement for sins and a reminder of the covenant between God and His people.

Overall, the blood in the Passover event symbolizes protection, salvation, atonement, and the importance of obedience to God's commands. It also points towards the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is considered the ultimate Passover Lamb in Christian belief, offering redemption and deliverance from sin.
