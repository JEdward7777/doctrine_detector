  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has shown a good understanding of the significance of the blood in the Passover event within the Hebrew tradition, relating it to protection, salvation, atonement, and obedience. They have effectively connected the symbolism of the blood to the sacrificial system. However, the student could have placed a stronger emphasis on the connection to sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith, as well as delved deeper into the concept of Jesus Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb."
