The response also effectively links the Passover event to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God in Christian belief. The only slight area for improvement would be to further elaborate on how Jesus fulfilled the sacrificial system and served as the ultimate atonement for sins in Christian theology."
