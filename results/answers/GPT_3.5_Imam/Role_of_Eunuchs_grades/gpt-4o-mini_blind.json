  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The student has made an effort to connect Islamic principles to the role of eunuchs in ancient societies, highlighting the value and contributions of all individuals in Islam. However, the response lacks specific Biblical references and a clear Christian worldview perspective. In order to improve, the student should integrate more explicit references to Christian teachings and how they relate to the role of eunuchs in ancient times, ultimately aligning their argument more closely with a Christian perspective."
