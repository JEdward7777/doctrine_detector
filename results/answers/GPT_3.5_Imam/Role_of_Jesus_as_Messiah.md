## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is a revered prophet and a Messiah sent by Allah to guide the Children of Israel. The concept of the kingdom, as it relates to Jesus' role as the Messiah, can be understood through the lens of his prophethood and the ultimate establishment of justice and righteousness.

Muslims believe that Jesus will return to Earth in the end times as a just ruler and will establish a kingdom based on justice and peace. This belief is based on various Islamic texts, including the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Quran.

Jesus' role as the Messiah is closely tied to the idea of establishing a righteous kingdom on Earth, where justice, equity, and compassion prevail. His Kingdom will be a reflection of the divine values of mercy and compassion that are central to Islamic teachings.

Therefore, the concept of the kingdom in relation to Jesus as the Messiah underscores the belief in a future where justice will prevail, and the oppressed will be uplifted. It is a reminder for Muslims to strive for righteousness and justice in their own lives and communities, following the example set by Prophet Jesus.
