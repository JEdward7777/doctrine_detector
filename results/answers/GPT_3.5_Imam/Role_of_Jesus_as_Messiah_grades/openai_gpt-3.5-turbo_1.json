The answer focused on the Islamic perspective of Jesus as a prophet and the establishment of a future kingdom based on justice and peace, rather than acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah fulfilling God's plan for salvation. More emphasis on Jesus' unique role in Christianity and his significance as the Savior would have been expected."
