However, from a Christian perspective, there is a significant theological difference in understanding Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who fulfills the prophecy of ruling over God's kingdom with righteousness. The response does not address the Christian-specific concept of Jesus' divinity and his role in God's plan for humanity, which is a crucial aspect when discussing the importance of Jesus' role as the Messiah."
