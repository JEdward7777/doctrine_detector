The answer accurately conveys the theological significance of this title, emphasizing Jesus' divine nature, role in creation, embodiment of divine wisdom, and intermediary function between God and humanity. The response effectively connects the concept to the Gospel of John and the broader Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God. Overall, this is a strong and doctrinally sound explanation. Great job!"
