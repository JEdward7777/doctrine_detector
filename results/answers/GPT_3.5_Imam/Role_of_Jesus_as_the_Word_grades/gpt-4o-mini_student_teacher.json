  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation of how the title \"the Word of God\" highlights Jesus' divine nature and role in creation in Christianity. However, the student's answer could have further emphasized the significance of Jesus' divinity and his role in revealing God, as mentioned in the concern. The reference answer more succinctly captures the central idea that Jesus fully reveals who God is as he embodies God's message to humanity."
