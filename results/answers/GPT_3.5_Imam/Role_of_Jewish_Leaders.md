## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
From an Islamic perspective, the Qur'an does not explicitly mention the specific role of Jewish religious leaders in the crucifixion of Jesus. However, it is important to note that the Quranic narrative differs from the Christian one in that Muslims do not believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was crucified. In Islam, it is believed that Jesus was not killed or crucified, but rather he was raised to the heavens by Allah.

It is also important to understand that Muslims are taught to respect all Prophets and messengers, including Jesus, and to approach discussions about other faiths with kindness and respect. It is not productive or appropriate to assign blame or make assumptions about other religious communities.
