  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response is not relevant to the Christian-specific worldview and biblical narrative asked in the question. The student should have focused on providing an analysis of how the prophet Nathan utilized a parable in confronting King David. The answer provided does not engage with the concern of understanding the use of parables for correction and revelation in biblical narratives."
