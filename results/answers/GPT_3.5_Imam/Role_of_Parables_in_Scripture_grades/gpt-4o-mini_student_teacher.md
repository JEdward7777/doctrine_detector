## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
It seems there might be a confusion here. In Islamic teachings, Prophet Nathan is not a prophet mentioned in the Quran or in Islamic tradition. The story of Prophet Nathan mentioned in the Bible is not part of Islamic teachings and is not considered authoritative in Islam. 

If you are referring to a story from Islamic teachings, please provide more details so I can offer a relevant response.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response is not relevant to the Christian-specific worldview and biblical narrative asked in the question. The student should have focused on providing an analysis of how the prophet Nathan utilized a parable in confronting King David. The answer provided does not engage with the concern of understanding the use of parables for correction and revelation in biblical narratives.
