## Question [Role of Parables in Scripture](../../../questions/Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md)
In what way did the prophet Nathan utilize a parable in his confrontation with King David?

## Correct Answer
The prophet Nathan told David a parable to reveal the king's terrible sin in a way that would lead to his acknowledgment and repentance.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives.

## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
It seems there might be a confusion here. In Islamic teachings, Prophet Nathan is not a prophet mentioned in the Quran or in Islamic tradition. The story of Prophet Nathan mentioned in the Bible is not part of Islamic teachings and is not considered authoritative in Islam. 

If you are referring to a story from Islamic teachings, please provide more details so I can offer a relevant response.

**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** 
While the student correctly points out that Prophet Nathan is not a figure recognized in Islamic tradition, they fail to address the concern related to the use of parables in biblical narratives. The response lacks a comprehensive analysis of the parable as a means of correction and revelation in the biblical story of Nathan and David.
