However, it primarily focuses on refuting the reference to Prophet Nathan rather than engaging with the concern about parables as a means of correction and revelation. The response could be improved by providing more insight into how parables are used in biblical narratives for correction and revelation, and exploring potential parallels or differences between Islamic and Christian understandings of parabolic storytelling."
