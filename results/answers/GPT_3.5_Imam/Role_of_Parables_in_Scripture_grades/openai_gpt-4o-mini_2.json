The explanation aligns well with the concern regarding the use of parables as a tool for correction and revelation within biblical narratives from a Christian perspective. The deductive marks are due to the lack of directly addressing the Islamic context or alternative teachings, which could have enriched the response further from a comparative religious perspective."
