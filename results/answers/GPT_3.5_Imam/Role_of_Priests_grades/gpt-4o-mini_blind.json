  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament according to the Bible. It covers key aspects such as offerings and sacrifices, intercession, teaching, ritual purity, and judgement/mediation. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the priestly role in the religious life of the community. However, for a higher grade, the student could have included more scriptural references to support each point and emphasized the significance of the priesthood in pointing towards the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, in the New Testament."
