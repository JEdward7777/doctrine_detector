  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a comprehensive overview of the primary responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament.\n* Supports each responsibility with clear examples from the Bible.\n* Recognizes the multifaceted role of priests as spiritual leaders and mediators between the people and God.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* Lacks specific examples or citations from the Bible to support the claims made about the responsibilities of priests.\n* Does not address the broader theological significance or spiritual impact of the priests' duties.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical role of priests. However, including more direct references and exploring the theological implications would further enhance the quality of the answer."
