However, the response could have delved deeper into the specific biblical context and significance of these duties, connecting them more explicitly to the priestly role as depicted in the Old Testament. Further reference to the priestly duties of intercession, maintaining ritual purity, judgement, and mediation as essential aspects of the priestly role in the Old Testament would have enhanced the overall analysis."
