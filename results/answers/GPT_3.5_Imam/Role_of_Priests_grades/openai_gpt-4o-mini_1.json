However, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical significance of these roles, emphasizing the priestly role as mediators between God and the people, emphasizing the need for atonement for sin, and highlighting the importance of priesthood in foreshadowing the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, in the New Testament. Further scriptural references and theological connections would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
