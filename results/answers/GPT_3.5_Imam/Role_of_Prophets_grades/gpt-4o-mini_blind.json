From a Christian perspective, the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible is to communicate God's messages and will to His people, often involving warning of sin and calling for repentance, rather than solely focusing on guiding people to the right path or providing moral and ethical guidance. The answer should have clearly distinguished the differences in the understanding of prophethood between Islam and Christianity."
