## [Answer](../Role_of_Prophets.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the context of Islam, which believes in the same prophets mentioned in the Bible, the primary role of a prophet is to convey the message of God to humanity, guide people to the right path, and warn them of the consequences of their actions. Prophets are also tasked with calling people to worship and submit to the one true God, to establish justice and righteousness in society, and to provide moral and ethical guidance to help people lead fulfilling and spiritually enriched lives. Ultimately, the goal of prophethood is to lead people towards God's mercy, forgiveness, and eternal salvation.

**Comment:**

While the student's answer correctly describes the primary role of a prophet in Islam, it fails to address the specific concern of the prompt, which is the biblical role of prophets. The answer should have focused on interpreting the biblical perspective of prophecy rather than discussing Islamic beliefs about prophets.
