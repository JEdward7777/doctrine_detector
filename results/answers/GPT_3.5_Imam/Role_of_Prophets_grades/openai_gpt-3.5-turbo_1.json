However, it does not fully address the concern of understanding the biblical role of prophets and their messages, as it focuses more on a general understanding of prophethood across various religions rather than specifically addressing the biblical perspective. Additional emphasis on the specific characteristics and functions of biblical prophets would strengthen the response."
