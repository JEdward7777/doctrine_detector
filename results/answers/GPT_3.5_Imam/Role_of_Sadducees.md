## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that my expertise lies in Islamic teachings and I do not have extensive knowledge about the specific roles and responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system. The Sadducees were a Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, known for their strict adherence to the Torah and their role in the Temple in Jerusalem. They were mainly responsible for overseeing religious rituals and practices at the Temple, such as offering sacrifices, maintaining the sanctity of the Temple, and ensuring that the religious laws were followed.

Their main responsibilities included performing priestly duties, regulating religious ceremonies, and making decisions on matters of Jewish law. The Sadducees were known for their conservative approach to religious interpretation and their focus on the literal observance of the Torah. They also held significant political power during their time, often collaborating with the ruling authorities.

It is important to note that my understanding of the Sadducees is based on general knowledge and may not cover all aspects of their responsibilities within the Jewish temple system.
