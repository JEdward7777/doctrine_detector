  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a decent overview of the responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system, mentioning their role in overseeing religious rituals and practices, offering sacrifices, and maintaining the sanctity of the Temple. However, the response lacked depth and did not fully address the specifics of the Sadducees' responsibilities as priestly leaders. Additionally, there was no exploration of the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus, which was a key aspect of the question."
