The response also lacks depth and nuance in its discussion of the Sadducees' responsibilities, failing to mention key aspects such as their conservative approach to religious interpretation and their significant political power.\n\nThe response does not directly address the main responsibility mentioned in the given answer (\"taking care of the temple complex and performing priestly tasks such as offering sacrifices\"), but it does provide some relevant information about the Sadducees' priestly duties. To better explore the historical context of religious leadership during this time, the response could have delved deeper into the Sadducees' role within the Temple system and their relationships with other Jewish sects, such as the Pharisees."
