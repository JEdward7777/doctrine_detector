They linked the practices of scribes to the preservation of the sacred texts and highlighted the meticulous care and dedication required in copying and maintaining accuracy. However, the answer could have been more focused on the specific responsibilities of scribes as mentioned in the reference answer, which would have strengthened the response further."
