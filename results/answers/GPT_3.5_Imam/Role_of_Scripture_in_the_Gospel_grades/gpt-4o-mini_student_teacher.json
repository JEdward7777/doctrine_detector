  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of how Scripture is used in sharing the Gospel message in the Bible, mentioning examples like quoting Old Testament scriptures, storytelling, parables, and references by the apostles. However, the student's answer lacked specificity in citing specific examples such as Philip and Paul as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, there was a missed opportunity to emphasize the unique Christian perspective on the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies through Jesus Christ, which is a significant aspect of integrating Scripture into the communication of the Gospel from a Christian worldview."
