  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately addresses the concern of understanding the integration of Scripture in the communication of the Gospel. However, the answer is primarily focused on the Bible, despite the fact that the student is a Muslim Imam. The student could have elaborated more on how Islamic texts such as the Quran and Hadith emphasize the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message. Additionally, the student's answer lacks specific examples from the Bible to support their claims."
