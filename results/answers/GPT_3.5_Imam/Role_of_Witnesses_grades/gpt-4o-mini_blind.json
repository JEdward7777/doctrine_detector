  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the role witnesses play in confirming the life and resurrection of Jesus in the New Testament, linking specific examples from the Gospels. The response displays understanding and knowledge of the importance of eyewitness testimonies in establishing the truth of Jesus' resurrection. However, the inclusion of the Islamic perspective, while informative, is not directly relevant to the question and detracts from the focus on the Christian worldview. For a higher grade, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological significance of these witnesses within Christian beliefs."
