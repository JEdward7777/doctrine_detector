  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response generally stays within the realm of the given answer by highlighting the importance of witnesses in the New Testament, particularly those who followed Jesus. It also touches on the concept of firsthand accounts, which aligns with the idea that witnesses shared their experiences. However, the response could be more robust in exploring the significance of these witnesses for Christian belief and practice.\n\nThe concern about Christians witnessing their faith and sharing personal experiences is partially addressed by mentioning the testimonies of those who followed Jesus, but it could be more explicitly connected to the call to witness one's faith.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could provide more specific examples of how the accounts of witnesses in the New Testament continue to inspire and strengthen Christian faith today. Additionally, a stronger connection between the importance of witnesses and the concern about Christians witnessing their faith would enhance the overall quality of the response."
