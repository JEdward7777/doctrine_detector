The explanation of the role of witnesses in confirming the life and resurrection of Jesus is clear and aligns well with the concern provided. The connection between the biblical accounts of witnesses and the modern-day application for Christians is well articulated. The discussion on the Islamic perspective, while informative, slightly detracts from the Christian-specific focus of the response."
