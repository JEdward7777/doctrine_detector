However, the focus of the question was on the unique responsibilities of the high priest in Israel compared to other priests, and this answer somewhat lacks specificity on that aspect. The mention of the high priest serving as the primary intercessor between the people and God, maintaining the sanctity of the Tabernacle or Temple, and representing the community in matters of atonement and reconciliation is accurate. There is room for improvement in providing more detailed and distinct responsibilities that set the high priest apart from other priests in Israel. Additionally, since the question states \"in Israel,\" it would be more relevant to focus solely on Jewish religious practices and not bring in comparisons with Islamic beliefs."
