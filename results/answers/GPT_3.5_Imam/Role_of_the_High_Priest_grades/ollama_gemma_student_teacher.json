  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the unique responsibilities of the high priest in ancient Israelite society. They accurately highlight the primary roles of leading religious ceremonies, serving as an intercessor, maintaining the sanctity of the Temple, and representing the community. However, the answer lacks specific mention of the high priest's unique privilege of entering the most holy part of the Tabernacle or Temple to offer the special sacrifice. This omission slightly diminishes the comprehensiveness of the response."
