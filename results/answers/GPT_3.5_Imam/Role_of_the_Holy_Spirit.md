## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, we do not have the concept of being "born again" in the same way that some Christian denominations do. However, we do believe in the importance of the Holy Spirit (known as Ruh al-Qudus) in empowering believers and guiding them in their faith.

The Holy Spirit is believed to be a source of Divine guidance and inspiration for Muslims. It is through the Holy Spirit that believers strive to live righteous lives, engage in acts of worship, and seek closeness to Allah.

The empowerment that comes from the Holy Spirit for a Muslim believer can be seen in various ways, such as:

1. Guidance: The Holy Spirit helps believers to understand and apply the teachings of Islam in their daily lives. It inspires them to seek knowledge, perform good deeds, and avoid sinful acts.

2. Strength and perseverance: The Holy Spirit provides believers with spiritual strength and endurance to overcome challenges and hardships. It gives them the ability to remain steadfast in their faith, especially during difficult times.

3. Connection with Allah: Through the Holy Spirit, believers can feel a deeper connection with Allah and experience His presence in their lives. It helps them to develop a strong relationship with their Creator through prayer, remembrance, and reflection.

Overall, the Holy Spirit plays a significant role in empowering Muslim believers to live a life of faith, righteousness, and submission to Allah.
