  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers in Islamic belief. However, the answer did not address the specific Christian concept of being \"born again\" and how the Holy Spirit empowers a believer in that context. To improve the grade, the student should focus on addressing the Christian perspective more directly."
