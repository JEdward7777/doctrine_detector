However, it does not directly address the concept of being \"born again\" as understood in Christian theology. The response focuses on the Islamic belief in the Holy Spirit as Ruh al-Qudus and its significance in guiding Muslims. While relevant to the concern expressed, this approach does not align entirely with the Christian perspective on the Holy Spirit's role in the believer's life after salvation."
