While the explanation about the Holy Spirit in Islamic belief is informative, it does not address the concern regarding the Christian perspective on being \"born again\" and the empowerment provided by the Holy Spirit for producing good spiritual fruit. In a Christian worldview, the Holy Spirit is understood to indwell believers after being born again through faith in Jesus Christ, guiding and empowering them to live according to God's will and produce spiritual fruit."
