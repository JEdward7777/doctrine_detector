# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic perspective, the concept of the Messiah is different from that in Christianity. In Islam, Jesus (peace be upon him) is regarded as the Messiah, but his role is primarily seen as that of a prophet who came to guide the Children of Israel and preach the worship of the One God. Islamic belief does not support the view that Jesus was crucified or that he died for the sins of humanity.

From the Christian perspective, the Messiah, or Christ, is seen as the savior and deliverer of humanity. According to the Bible, the Messiah was prophesied to come as a descendant of King David, to establish God's kingdom on earth, to redeem humanity from sin, and to bring about the ultimate judgment and salvation.

Christians believe that Jesus fulfilled these roles through his teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection. He is seen as the perfect and final sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, the one who conquered death, and the one who will return in the future for the final judgment.

It's important to note the differences in the understanding of the Messiah between Islam and Christianity, as both religions have distinct theological beliefs and interpretations of scripture regarding this topic.

Comment: The response provides a clear comparison between the Islamic and Christian perspectives on the Messiah, highlighting the differences in roles and beliefs. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the distinctive Christian view of the Messiah as a prophet, priest, and king who establishes the New Covenant. The explanation could be further enhanced by including more specific biblical references to support the Christian perspective on the Messiah's mission and authority.
