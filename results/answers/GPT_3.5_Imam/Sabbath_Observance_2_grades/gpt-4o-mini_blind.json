The focus on Friday prayers and the Sabbath in Islam is not relevant to the question asked, which specifically inquired about God's instructions to the Israelites regarding gathering manna in relation to the Sabbath within the Biblical framework. This answer lacks doctrinal correctness in addressing the specific biblical account and theological implications related to God's provision and commandments."
