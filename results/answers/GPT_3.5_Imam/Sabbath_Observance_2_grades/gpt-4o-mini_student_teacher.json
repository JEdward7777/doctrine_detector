  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer references the Quran and provides a perspective from Islam, rather than addressing the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands as specified in the concern. The answer also does not accurately portray the specific instructions given by God to the Israelites regarding gathering manna in relation to the Sabbath. The student should focus more on the biblical narrative and the significance of obeying God's commands related to the Sabbath."
