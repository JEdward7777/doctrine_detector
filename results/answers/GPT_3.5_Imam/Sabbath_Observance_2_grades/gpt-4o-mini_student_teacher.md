## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Quran, there is a mention of the story of the Israelites being provided manna and quails as a test of their obedience to God's commandments. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:57), it is mentioned that God provided manna and quails to the Israelites in the wilderness and instructed them to gather only what they needed for the day, except on the day before the Sabbath.

On Fridays, the Israelites were instructed to gather and prepare enough manna for two days - Friday and Saturday, as Saturday is the Sabbath when they were not supposed to work or gather food. This was a test of their obedience and trust in God's provision. Those who tried to gather extra manna on the Sabbath day were met with disappointment as it would spoil and not be fit for consumption.

This story serves as a reminder for us as Muslims to trust in Allah's provision and to observe the Sabbath, or in our case, Friday prayers and the recommended acts of worship on Fridays. It also teaches us the importance of following God's commands and not being greedy or hoarding resources beyond our needs.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer references the Quran and provides a perspective from Islam, rather than addressing the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands as specified in the concern. The answer also does not accurately portray the specific instructions given by God to the Israelites regarding gathering manna in relation to the Sabbath. The student should focus more on the biblical narrative and the significance of obeying God's commands related to the Sabbath.
