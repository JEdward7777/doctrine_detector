However, it lacks depth in addressing the importance and significance of keeping the Sabbath holy as commanded by God to Moses. It would have been beneficial to include a brief discussion on the theological reasoning behind Sabbath observance in Judaism and how it relates to God's commandments. Additionally, the response could have elaborated more on the concept of sanctifying a specific day for worship and rest in the Islamic faith."
