  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates an understanding of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship, but it does not address the Christian perspective on keeping the Sabbath holy according to the Ten Commandments. The student correctly points out that Muslims do not observe the Sabbath in the same way as Jews, but they fail to explain how their understanding of worship and rest differs from the Christian understanding. Additionally, the student's answer lacks specific examples or references to support their claims."
