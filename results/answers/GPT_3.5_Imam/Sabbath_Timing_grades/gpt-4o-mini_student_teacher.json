  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provides some correct information about the timing of the Sabbath in Jewish tradition, but the answer is quite confusing and includes irrelevant information about Muslim traditions. The response lacks focus on the specific timeframe for the observance of the Sabbath according to Biblical teachings. More clarity and accuracy in addressing the concern would have improved the grade."
