## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Jewish tradition, the Sabbath, also known as Shabbat, begins at sunset on Friday and ends at nightfall on Saturday. It is observed as a day of rest and worship, with activities such as lighting candles, attending synagogue services, and refraining from work and certain activities. Muslims do not observe the Sabbath in the same way as Jews, as our holy day of the week is Friday, known as Jumu'ah, when congregational prayers are performed in the mosque. The Sabbath is a reminder of the importance of rest and worship in both Jewish and Islamic traditions.
