  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response provides a well-explained perspective on loving others sacrificially from an Islamic worldview, but it does not directly address the essence of God's love as exemplified by Jesus and how it should reflect in personal relationships. The focus on Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the ultimate example detracts from the Christian-specific aspect of sacrificial love demonstrated by Jesus. The student should further develop their understanding of sacrificial love within the context of Christianity to improve their grade."
