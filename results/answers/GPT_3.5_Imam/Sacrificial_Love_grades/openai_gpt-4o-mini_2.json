The mention of Prophet Muhammad as an example of sacrificial love is relevant. However, the response could have further connected the concept to the essence of God's love as demonstrated through Jesus Christ's sacrificial act, which is central to the Christian worldview. This deeper connection would have strengthened the response in addressing the concern more directly from a Christian perspective."
