  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the beliefs of the Sadducees and their contrast with Christian teaching regarding the resurrection. They accurately highlighted the differences in beliefs and their implications for faith. However, the student's answer went into more detail than necessary, deviating slightly from the specific concern provided. The reference answer was more concise and directly addressed the contrast in beliefs."
