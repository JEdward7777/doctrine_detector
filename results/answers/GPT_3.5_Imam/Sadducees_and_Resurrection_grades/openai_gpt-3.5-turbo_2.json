  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the differences in beliefs between the Sadducees and Christians regarding the resurrection. It accurately points out that the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection, while Christians affirm the resurrection of Jesus and the promise of resurrection for believers. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding differences in beliefs and their implications for faith from a Christian perspective. However, to improve the grade, more depth could be added to the explanation of how these beliefs impact faith and the broader theological implications of these differences."
