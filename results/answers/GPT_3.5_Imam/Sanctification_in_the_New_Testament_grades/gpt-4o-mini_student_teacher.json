  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed overview of how the New Testament describes the sanctification process for believers in Jesus, which is commendable. However, the student's answer did not address the specific concern of recognizing the role of faith in the sanctification process, which is essential in Christian theology. In order to improve the grade, the student should have integrated the role of faith in how believers participate in the sanctification process through trust and obedience to God."
