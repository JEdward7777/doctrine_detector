# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that my understanding is based on Islamic teachings rather than Christian theology. However, I can provide a general overview of how the New Testament describes the sanctification process for believers in Jesus.

In Christianity, sanctification is the process by which a believer is made holy and set apart for God's purposes. According to the New Testament, this process involves the work of the Holy Spirit in transforming the believer to become more like Christ.

One key passage that discusses sanctification is found in the book of Romans, where the apostle Paul writes about the ongoing transformation that takes place in the life of a believer. In Romans 8:29, Paul explains that believers are predestined to be conformed to the image of Christ, which suggests a process of becoming more like Jesus through the work of the Holy Spirit.

Additionally, the book of 1 Thessalonians 4:3 highlights the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God and growing in holiness. This suggests that sanctification involves not only being set apart for Godâ€™s purposes but also living in a way that reflects the character of Christ.

Overall, the New Testament teaches that sanctification is a lifelong process that involves the believer cooperating with the work of the Holy Spirit in order to grow in holiness and become more like Jesus.
