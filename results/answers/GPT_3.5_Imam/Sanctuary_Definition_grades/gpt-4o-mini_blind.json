  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a generally accurate explanation of the term \"sanctuary\" in the context of the Bible, covering both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively connects the sanctuary to places of worship in the Old Testament and the concept of believers being the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. The mention of believers being holy and set apart is commendable. To improve, the response could delve deeper into the significance of the sanctuary in both testaments and provide more specific scriptural references to support the points made."
