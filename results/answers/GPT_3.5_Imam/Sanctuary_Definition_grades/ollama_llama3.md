## [Answer](../Sanctuary_Definition.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the context of the Bible, the term "sanctuary" refers to a sacred or holy place, typically used for worship or religious purposes. In the Old Testament, the sanctuary often refers to the Tabernacle or Temple where the Israelites worshipped God and offered sacrifices. The sanctuary was considered a place where God's presence dwelt among His people.

In the New Testament, the concept of the sanctuary is extended to include the idea that believers themselves are now the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). Christians are seen as holy and set apart for God's purposes, making their bodies a sanctuary that should be honored and respected.

Overall, the concept of sanctuary in the Bible emphasizes the idea of a place or state of holiness, where God's presence is felt and worshipped.
