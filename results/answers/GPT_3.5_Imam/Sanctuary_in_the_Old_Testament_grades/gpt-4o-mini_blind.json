  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament. It accurately explains the sanctity of the sanctuary as a place where God's presence dwelled among His people, the need for sincerity and reverence in approaching God, and the significance of worship, sacrifice, and obedience. The use of relevant biblical references, such as Exodus 25:8, supports the explanation well. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound answer."
