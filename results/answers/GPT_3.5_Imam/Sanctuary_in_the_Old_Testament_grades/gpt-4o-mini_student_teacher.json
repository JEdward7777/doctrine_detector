  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament. The response includes relevant scriptural references and explains the significance of the sanctuary as a place of worship, sacrifice, and divine presence. The student accurately captures the essence of the sanctuary as a meeting place between God and His people. However, the primary concern of recognizing the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people could be more explicitly addressed in the response to align more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
