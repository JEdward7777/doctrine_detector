In the Old Testament, God described the sanctuary as a holy place where His presence dwelled among His people.

It served as a physical reminder of God's presence and the need for His people to approach Him with sincerity and reverence.

God instructed the Israelites to build the sanctuary according to specific instructions given to Moses on Mount Sinai. The design and details of the sanctuary symbolized God's holiness, the need for atonement for sins, and the importance of worship and obedience.

In the book of Exodus, God said, "Then have them make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell among them" (Exodus 25:8). This verse reflects the intimate relationship between God and His people, emphasizing the importance of the sanctuary as a meeting place between humanity and the Divine.

Throughout the Old Testament, the sanctuary was a place of sacrifice, prayer, and repentance. It was a symbol of God's covenant with His people and a reminder of the need for reconciliation and obedience.

Overall, the sanctuary in the Old Testament was a sacred space that connected God with His people and emphasized the importance of worship, obedience, and atonement.
