The connection between the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of protection for His people is effectively highlighted. However, the response could have further elaborated on the concept of the sanctuary as a symbol of God's holiness and the need for reconciliation through sacrifice and obedience. Overall, a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on the sanctuary is demonstrated."
