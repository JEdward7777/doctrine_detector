# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Satan (known as Shaytan) and his followers will be punished in Hell for their disobedience and rebellion against Allah. The Quran mentions that Satan refused to bow down to Adam out of pride and was subsequently cast out of Paradise. It is believed that Satan and his followers continue to misguide and tempt humans, leading them away from the path of righteousness.

On the Day of Judgment, Satan and his followers will be held accountable for their actions and will be punished in the Hellfire. The Quran describes Hell as a place of intense heat, torment, and suffering for those who have committed evil deeds and rejected the guidance of Allah.

It is important for Muslims to seek protection from Satan by reciting the Quran, engaging in acts of worship, and seeking refuge in Allah from his whispers. By following the teachings of Islam and striving to live a righteous life, Muslims can protect themselves from the influence of Satan and avoid the fate that awaits him and his followers in Hell.
