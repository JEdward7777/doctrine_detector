  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on the fate of Satan and his followers in hell. It accurately summarizes the Quranic account of Satan's disobedience and subsequent expulsion from Paradise, and explains the belief that he continues to tempt humans. The response also correctly describes the punishment awaiting Satan and his followers in the Hellfire. However, the answer is limited to the Islamic belief system and does not address the Christian perspective on this issue, which was the specified concern in the prompt."
