It acknowledges the consequences of their disobedience and rebellion against Allah. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to note that in Christian theology, the ultimate fate of Satan is also eternal punishment in the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10). Understanding this shared belief can help in recognizing the universal struggle between good and evil in both Islamic and Christian perspectives."
