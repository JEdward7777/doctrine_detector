  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student provided a well-written explanation of intercession from an Islamic perspective, citing relevant Quranic verses and interpreting them in the context of praying for others. However, it must be noted that the focus of the question was on Bible verses providing insights into interceding for others, not Islamic teachings. The answer would have been more appropriate if it had discussed intercession within the framework of Christian beliefs and scriptures. Additionally, the answer did not accurately address the specific question asked, leading to a lower grade."
