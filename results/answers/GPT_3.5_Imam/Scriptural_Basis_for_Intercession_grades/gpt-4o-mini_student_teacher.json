  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and cohesive response exploring the concept of intercession in Islam and the importance of praying for others. However, the specific concern was to explore Bible verses for guidance on intercession, which the student did not address. The answer would have been stronger if it had included relevant Bible verses explicitly related to interceding for others, as provided in the reference answer."
