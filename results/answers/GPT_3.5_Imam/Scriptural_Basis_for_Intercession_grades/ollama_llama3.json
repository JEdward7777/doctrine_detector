The provided answer does not mention any relevant Bible verses or passages that would support this concern. Instead, the response focuses primarily on Islamic concepts and references Quranic verses, which are irrelevant to the original concern. To better align with the concern, a more effective response might engage directly with Scripture, highlighting relevant passages and their implications for Christian prayer and intercession."
