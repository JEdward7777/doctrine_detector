# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, intercession is understood as seeking the assistance or intervention of a higher authority on behalf of oneself or someone else. While the concept of interceding for others is not directly found in the Quran, there are some verses that can provide insights on the importance of seeking help for others through prayer and supplication.

One verse that emphasizes the importance of praying for others is found in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:186), where Allah says, "And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me and believe in Me that they may be guided."

This verse highlights the importance of supplicating to Allah on behalf of oneself and others, indicating that Allah is near and responsive to the prayers of those who seek Him sincerely.

Another verse that can provide insights into interceding for others is in Surah Al-Furqan (25:74), where Allah says, "And those who say, 'Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us an example for the righteous.'"

This verse shows the importance of seeking Allah's blessings and mercy for one's family members, indicating that it is permissible and encouraged to pray for the well-being and guidance of others.

In summary, while there may not be direct references to interceding for others in the Quran, the concept of seeking Allah's help and blessings for oneself and others through prayer and supplication is emphasized in several verses. Muslims are encouraged to pray for the well-being, guidance, and forgiveness of not only themselves but also their family members, friends, and the wider community.
