  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response provides a thorough explanation of intercession in Islam based on Quranic verses, the lack of engagement with the specified concern to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession from a Christian perspective significantly impacts the grade. The response does not incorporate the provided Christian verses or reflections from a Christian worldview, resulting in a lower grade."
