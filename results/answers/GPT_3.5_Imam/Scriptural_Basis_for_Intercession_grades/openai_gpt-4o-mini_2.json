  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the concept of intercession in Islam, utilizing relevant verses from the Quran to support the discussion. However, the response does not directly address the concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession from a Christian perspective. To improve the grade, the response could have included more explicit references to Christian scriptures and teachings on intercessory prayer."
