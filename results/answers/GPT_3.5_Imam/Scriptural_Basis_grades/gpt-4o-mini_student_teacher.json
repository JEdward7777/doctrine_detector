  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of propitiation within Christianity and correctly referenced verses such as Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2, and Hebrews 2:17 to support their explanation. However, they missed citing 1 John 4:10 which is also a key verse supporting the concept of propitiation. Additionally, the student effectively acknowledged the differences in the understanding of atonement between Christianity and Islam, demonstrating a respectful approach to comparing the two faith traditions."
