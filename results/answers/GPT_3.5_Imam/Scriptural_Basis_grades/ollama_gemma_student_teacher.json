  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of propitiation and provides relevant biblical references to support their claim. However, the response lacks a deeper theological analysis of the concept and does not explicitly address the specified concern of connecting the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding. Additionally, the student's explanation of the Islamic perspective on atonement is not directly relevant to the question."
