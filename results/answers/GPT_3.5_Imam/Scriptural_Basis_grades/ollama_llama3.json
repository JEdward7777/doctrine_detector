  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of connecting the theological concept with biblical references, providing three specific verses (Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2, and Hebrews 2:17) that support the idea of propitiation. The inclusion of these verses within their respective contexts helps to provide a deeper understanding of the concept.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not directly address the original answer or concern. While it does mention some key verses related to propitiation, it does not explicitly state how these verses support the idea or provide a clear connection between the theological concept and biblical references.\n\nComment: The response provides a good understanding of the concept of propitiation in Christianity and supports this with relevant biblical references. To take it to the next level, consider directly addressing the original answer and concern by highlighting how the provided verses specifically connect to the idea of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins."
