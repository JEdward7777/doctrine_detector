  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the theological concept of propitiation with biblical references for deeper understanding within the Christian context. The incorporation of specific verses such as 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26 adds depth to the explanation and demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic. The response could be further enhanced by providing additional context or explanations for how these verses contribute to the understanding of Jesus as the propitiation for sins."
