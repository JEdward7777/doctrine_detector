## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic faith, we do not consider the Bible to be the ultimate authority, as we believe that the original message of the previous scriptures has been altered over time. However, the concept of propitiation is found in Christianity, particularly in the doctrine of atonement. 

Within the Christian context, some verses that are often referenced to support the concept of propitiation include:

1. Romans 3:25 - "God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his bloodâ€”to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness..." 

2. 1 John 2:2 - "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."

3. Hebrews 2:17 - "For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people."

It is important to note that these verses are interpreted and understood within the Christian theological framework and may not hold the same significance or meaning in the Islamic tradition. In Islam, the concept of atonement is different, and forgiveness of sins is primarily sought through sincere repentance, seeking forgiveness from Allah, and performing good deeds.

The response could be further enhanced by providing additional context or explanations for how these verses contribute to the understanding of Jesus as the propitiation for sins.
