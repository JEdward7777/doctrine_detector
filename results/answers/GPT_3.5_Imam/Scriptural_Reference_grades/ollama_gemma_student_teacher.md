## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic faith, we believe in the Quran as the final and most complete revelation from Allah to humanity. However, we also recognize the Bible as a sacred scripture that contains guidance from Allah. Regarding the concept of the "world" in relation to believers, there are several passages in the Bible that address this concept:

1. John 17:14-16: In these verses, Jesus prays to God for his followers, saying that they are not of the world, just as he is not of the world. He asks God to protect them from the evil one because they belong to God.

2. 1 John 2:15-17: This passage warns believers not to love the world or the things in the world, as they are temporary and will pass away. Instead, believers are encouraged to do the will of God, which will last forever.

3. Romans 12:2: This verse instructs believers not to conform to the pattern of this world, but to be transformed by the renewing of their minds in order to understand and do God's will.

These passages emphasize the idea that believers should not be attached to the materialistic and transient aspects of the world but should instead focus on following the teachings of God and living a righteous and virtuous life.
