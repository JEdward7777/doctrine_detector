  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of key passages in the Bible that address how believers should view and interact with the world, emphasizing the importance of not conforming to ungodly values. The references to John 17:14-16, 1 John 2:15-17, and Romans 12:2 appropriately address the concern raised about navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values. However, the response could have elaborated more on how believers are called to be in the world but not of it, and how they can bring light and salt to a secular society while upholding their faith."
