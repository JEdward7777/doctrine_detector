  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant biblical passages to support the concept of the day of judgment, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the answer focused more on the comparison between Islam and Christianity rather than solely addressing the biblical passages supporting the day of judgment. To improve the grade, the student should have directly addressed the concern provided by focusing solely on the scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment."
