  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of the Day of Judgment and provides relevant biblical passages to support the claim. However, the response lacks specific references to the passages mentioned in the reference answer, which could have enhanced the overall depth and completeness of the analysis. Additionally, the student's acknowledgment of the differences between the Christian and Islamic understandings of the Day of Judgment shows a thoughtful consideration of different perspectives."
