  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does provide some biblical passages that support the concept of judgment, which aligns with the concern to deepen understanding of scripture related to judgment. The inclusion of non-canonical references (Matthew 25:31-46, Romans 2:5-11, and 2 Corinthians 5:10) from the New Testament also adds value to the response.\n\nHowever, the main concern is to provide scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment, and while the passages provided are relevant, they do not directly address the key passages mentioned in the answer (Luke 10:12, Luke 11:31, Luke 11:32, Matthew 10:15, and Matthew 12:36). The response could be strengthened by providing more direct connections to these specific passages.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some useful biblical support for the concept of judgment, it does not fully address the concern to provide a scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment."
