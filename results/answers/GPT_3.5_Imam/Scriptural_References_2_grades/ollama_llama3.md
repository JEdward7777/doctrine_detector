## Question [Scriptural References 2](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_2.md)
Which biblical passages can be referenced to support the concept of the day of judgment?

## Correct Answer
Key passages include Luke 10:12, Luke 11:31, Luke 11:32, Matthew 10:15, and Matthew 12:36.

## Stated Concern
This seeks to deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, the concept of the Day of Judgment, also known as the Day of Resurrection or the Last Day, is a core belief that is mentioned in the Quran. However, there are also biblical passages that can be referenced to support this concept:

1. Matthew 25:31-46: In this passage, Jesus speaks about the coming of the Son of Man in glory and the separation of the righteous from the wicked on the day of judgment. Those who have shown kindness and compassion to others will inherit the kingdom, while those who have not will face punishment.

2. Romans 2:5-11: This passage emphasizes the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God. It speaks about God's judgment based on people's deeds and the eternal destiny of individuals.

3. 2 Corinthians 5:10: This verse talks about how all of us will appear before the judgment seat of Christ, where each person will receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.

While these biblical passages may not align perfectly with the Islamic understanding of the Day of Judgment, they do provide some common ground in terms of the belief in a final judgment by God based on one's actions in this world.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response does provide some biblical passages that support the concept of judgment, which aligns with the concern to deepen understanding of scripture related to judgment. The inclusion of non-canonical references (Matthew 25:31-46, Romans 2:5-11, and 2 Corinthians 5:10) from the New Testament also adds value to the response.

However, the main concern is to provide scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment, and while the passages provided are relevant, they do not directly address the key passages mentioned in the answer (Luke 10:12, Luke 11:31, Luke 11:32, Matthew 10:15, and Matthew 12:36). The response could be strengthened by providing more direct connections to these specific passages.

Overall, while the response provides some useful biblical support for the concept of judgment, it does not fully address the concern to provide a scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment.
