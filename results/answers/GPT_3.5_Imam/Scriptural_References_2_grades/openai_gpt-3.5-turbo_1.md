## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, the concept of the Day of Judgment, also known as the Day of Resurrection or the Last Day, is a core belief that is mentioned in the Quran. However, there are also biblical passages that can be referenced to support this concept:

1. Matthew 25:31-46: In this passage, Jesus speaks about the coming of the Son of Man in glory and the separation of the righteous from the wicked on the day of judgment. Those who have shown kindness and compassion to others will inherit the kingdom, while those who have not will face punishment.

2. Romans 2:5-11: This passage emphasizes the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God. It speaks about God's judgment based on people's deeds and the eternal destiny of individuals.

3. 2 Corinthians 5:10: This verse talks about how all of us will appear before the judgment seat of Christ, where each person will receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.

While these biblical passages may not align perfectly with the Islamic understanding of the Day of Judgment, they do provide some common ground in terms of the belief in a final judgment by God based on one's actions in this world.
