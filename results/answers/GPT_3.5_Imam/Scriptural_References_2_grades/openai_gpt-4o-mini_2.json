The inclusion of Luke 10:12, Luke 11:31, Luke 11:32, Matthew 10:15, and Matthew 12:36 enhances the understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforces the scriptural basis for beliefs, aligning well with the specified concern. There is a clear effort to show how these passages contribute to a Christian worldview regarding the final judgment by God based on one's actions. Great job in expanding on the scriptural foundation for this belief."
