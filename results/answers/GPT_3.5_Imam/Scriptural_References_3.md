## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I am not well-versed in the New Testament of the Bible, including the book of Matthew. However, the concept of iniquity in Islam is similar to the Christian concept of sin. In Islam, iniquity refers to wrongdoing, disobedience to God's commandments, and behavior that is harmful to oneself or others.

In Islamic teachings, iniquity is a serious matter that should be avoided at all costs. The Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasize the importance of repentance, seeking forgiveness from Allah, and striving to amend one's ways to avoid falling into iniquity.

It is important for Muslims to reflect on their actions, seek forgiveness for their sins, and strive to lead a righteous and pious life in accordance with the teachings of Islam. The Quran teaches that Allah is the Most Merciful and Most Forgiving, and He is always ready to forgive those who sincerely repent and seek His forgiveness.

In summary, iniquity in Islam is seen as a serious offense that should be avoided through seeking forgiveness, repentance, and striving to lead a life in accordance with the teachings of Islam.
