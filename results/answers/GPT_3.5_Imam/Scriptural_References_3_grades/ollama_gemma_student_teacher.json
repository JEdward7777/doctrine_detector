  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of iniquity in Islam and its similarities to the Christian concept of sin. However, the response lacks specific references to the passage Matthew 23:27-28, which is the basis for the given concern. The student could have elaborated on how the passage illuminates the nature of iniquity as described in the Christian worldview."
