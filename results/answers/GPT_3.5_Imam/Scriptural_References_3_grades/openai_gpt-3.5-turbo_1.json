  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a good explanation of how iniquity is viewed in Islam and emphasized the importance of seeking forgiveness and leading a righteous life. However, it did not directly address the concern raised from a Christian perspective regarding the importance of genuine holiness over mere external compliance to religious standards found in Matthew 23:27-28. To improve the grade, the response could have included a comparison with the Christian understanding of iniquity and the importance of inner righteousness as highlighted in the Bible verse provided."
