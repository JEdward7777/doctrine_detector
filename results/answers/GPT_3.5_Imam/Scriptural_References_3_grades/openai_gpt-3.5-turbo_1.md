# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I am not well-versed in the New Testament of the Bible, including the book of Matthew. However, the concept of iniquity in Islam is similar to the Christian concept of sin. In Islam, iniquity refers to wrongdoing, disobedience to God's commandments, and behavior that is harmful to oneself or others.

In Islamic teachings, iniquity is a serious matter that should be avoided at all costs. The Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasize the importance of repentance, seeking forgiveness from Allah, and striving to amend one's ways to avoid falling into iniquity.

It is important for Muslims to reflect on their actions, seek forgiveness for their sins, and strive to lead a righteous and pious life in accordance with the teachings of Islam. The Quran teaches that Allah is the Most Merciful and Most Forgiving, and He is always ready to forgive those who sincerely repent and seek His forgiveness.

In summary, iniquity in Islam is seen as a serious offense that should be avoided through seeking forgiveness, repentance, and striving to lead a life in accordance with the teachings of Islam.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provided a good explanation of how iniquity is viewed in Islam and emphasized the importance of seeking forgiveness and leading a righteous life. However, it did not directly address the concern raised from a Christian perspective regarding the importance of genuine holiness over mere external compliance to religious standards found in Matthew 23:27-28. To improve the grade, the response could have included a comparison with the Christian understanding of iniquity and the importance of inner righteousness as highlighted in the Bible verse provided.
