While the response does not directly address the concern regarding the importance of inner righteousness over outward appearances, it effectively communicates the seriousness of iniquity within an Islamic context. The discussion on seeking forgiveness and leading a righteous life aligns with the Christian principle of pursuing genuine holiness."
