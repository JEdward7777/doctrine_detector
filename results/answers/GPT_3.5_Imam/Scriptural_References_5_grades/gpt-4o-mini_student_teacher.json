  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70.\nThe student correctly identified Luke 16:19-31 as a key verse illustrating the shift in understanding of Hades but also incorporated Revelation 20:13-15 to further support their argument, which demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused on the specific verses provided in the reference answer, Luke 16:23 and Luke 23:43. Focusing on these verses would have shown a deeper engagement with the question and a more precise response."
