## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_5.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, there are several verses that indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous. One of the key verses that highlights this shift is found in the Gospel of Luke, where Jesus tells the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31.

In this parable, Jesus describes a rich man who lived a life of luxury and ignored the needs of a poor man named Lazarus who lay at his gate. When both men die, the rich man is sent to Hades where he is in torment, while Lazarus is taken to the "bosom of Abraham" or Paradise. This depiction of Hades as a place of torment for the unrighteous is a departure from the neutral understanding of Hades found in some earlier Jewish and Greco-Roman beliefs.

Another verse that indicates a shift in the understanding of Hades is found in the Book of Revelation, specifically in Revelation 20:13-15, where it is described as a place where the unrighteous will be judged and condemned:

"The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire."

These verses highlight the transformation of Hades from a neutral realm of the dead to a place of judgment and punishment for the unrighteous in the teachings of the New Testament.
