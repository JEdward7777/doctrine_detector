## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I do not interpret or explain verses from the Bible as it is not my area of expertise. However, I can share some thoughts on the concept of exaltation from an Islamic perspective.

In Islam, the concept of exaltation is closely tied to the idea of Tawhid, or the Oneness of Allah. Allah is the Exalted in Islam, and He is the one who is elevated in every way above His creation. Muslims believe that no one is comparable to Allah and He alone deserves all praise and exaltation.

Surah Al-Ahzab in the Quran (33:56) states: "Indeed, Allah and His angels confer blessing upon the Prophet. O you who have believed, ask [ Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [ Allah to grant him] peace." This verse shows the exaltation of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) by Allah and His angels, as well as the command for believers to send blessings upon him.

In Islamic teachings, humility is also emphasized as a virtue. Muslims are encouraged to be humble and not to seek personal exaltation or pride. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "He who has in his heart the weight of a mustard seed of pride shall not enter Paradise." (Sahih Muslim) This highlights the importance of humility in Islam and the need to avoid arrogance and self-exaltation.

Overall, in Islam, exaltation is reserved for Allah alone, and believers are encouraged to be humble in their dealings with others and in their worship of the Almighty.
