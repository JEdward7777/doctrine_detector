  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on exaltation and humility, the answer did not address the specific biblical verses mentioned in the question or connect the principles of humility and exaltation within Christianity. To improve the grade, the student should focus on addressing the given biblical passages and discussing how they illustrate the concept of exaltation within the Christian faith."
