The understanding of exaltation being reserved for God alone in Islam aligns well with the exaltation of Jesus highlighted in the Bible. The response effectively addresses the concern by showing the parallel between humility in Islam and the exaltation of Jesus in Christianity, showcasing the interconnectedness of these principles across both faith traditions."
