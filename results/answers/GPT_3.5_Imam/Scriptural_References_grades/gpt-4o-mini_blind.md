## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I can confirm that the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham can be found in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. In Genesis 17:1, God appears to Abraham and introduces Himself as "God Almighty" (El Shaddai in Hebrew). This title emphasizes God's all-powerful nature and signifies His ability to fulfill His promises.

Grade: 60

Comment: While the student correctly identified the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham in the Book of Genesis, they mentioned being a Muslim Imam, which may imply a different theological perspective than a Christian one. Additionally, the student could have expanded more on the significance of God's title "God Almighty" in the Christian understanding.
