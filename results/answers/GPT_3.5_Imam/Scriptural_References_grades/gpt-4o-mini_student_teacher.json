  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student accurately identified the book of Genesis as containing the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham and provided the correct verse reference (Genesis 17:1). The student's knowledge and explanation demonstrate a solid understanding of the biblical text and its significance. However, the response could have been improved by explicitly connecting the deeper connection to Scripture and God's promises that knowing this reference brings, as highlighted in the given concern."
