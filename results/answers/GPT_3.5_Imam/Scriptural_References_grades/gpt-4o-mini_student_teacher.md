## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I can confirm that the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham can be found in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. In Genesis 17:1, God appears to Abraham and introduces Himself as "God Almighty" (El Shaddai in Hebrew). This title emphasizes God's all-powerful nature and signifies His ability to fulfill His promises.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student accurately identified the book of Genesis as containing the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham and provided the correct verse reference (Genesis 17:1). The student's knowledge and explanation demonstrate a solid understanding of the biblical text and its significance. However, the response could have been improved by explicitly connecting the deeper connection to Scripture and God's promises that knowing this reference brings, as highlighted in the given concern.
