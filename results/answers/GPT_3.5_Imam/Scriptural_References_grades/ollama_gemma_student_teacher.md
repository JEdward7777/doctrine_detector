## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I can confirm that the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham can be found in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. In Genesis 17:1, God appears to Abraham and introduces Himself as "God Almighty" (El Shaddai in Hebrew). This title emphasizes God's all-powerful nature and signifies His ability to fulfill His promises.

**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:**

The student's answer is accurate in stating that the reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham can be found in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. However, the answer is not specifically from a Christian worldview and does not address the concern of deepening the connection to Scripture and God's promises. The answer also includes a statement regarding the Islamic perspective, which is not relevant to the Christian specific worldview.
