## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I can confirm that the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham can be found in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. In Genesis 17:1, God appears to Abraham and introduces Himself as "God Almighty" (El Shaddai in Hebrew). This title emphasizes God's all-powerful nature and signifies His ability to fulfill His promises.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 85.

The response accurately answers the question about the reference to God as 'Almighty' in Genesis, specifically citing Genesis 17:1. This meets the concern of knowing biblical references and deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises. The response also provides additional context by explaining the meaning behind "God Almighty" (El Shaddai) and its significance.

The only deduction is for a lack of explicit emphasis on how this reference helps deepen one's connection to Scripture and God's promises, as per the concern. While the response does provide some insights into the title's meaning, it could be strengthened by explicitly highlighting how knowing this reference can lead to a deeper understanding of God's power and faithfulness.

Overall, the response is well-structured and accurate, making it a strong 85 out of 100.
