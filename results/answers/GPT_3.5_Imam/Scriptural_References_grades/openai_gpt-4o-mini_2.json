The concern about deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises is valid and important within a Christian worldview. However, given the Islamic perspective provided by the writer (Muslim Imam), it is essential to approach the response from a Christian-specific worldview and consider the potential differences in theological understanding between Islam and Christianity."
