## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I can confirm that the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham can be found in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. In Genesis 17:1, God appears to Abraham and introduces Himself as "God Almighty" (El Shaddai in Hebrew). This title emphasizes God's all-powerful nature and signifies His ability to fulfill His promises.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately identifies the reference to God as 'Almighty' in the book of Genesis and specifies the exact verse (Genesis 17:1). The concern about deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises is valid and important within a Christian worldview. However, given the Islamic perspective provided by the writer (Muslim Imam), it is essential to approach the response from a Christian-specific worldview and consider the potential differences in theological understanding between Islam and Christianity.
