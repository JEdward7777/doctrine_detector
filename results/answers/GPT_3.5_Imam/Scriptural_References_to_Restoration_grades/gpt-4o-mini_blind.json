  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student provided relevant Bible verses emphasizing the theme of restoration as requested, which is a good effort. However, the student mistakenly included their personal perspective as a follower of Islam, which was not relevant to the question's focus on Christianity. The response lacks a clear distinction between the two faiths and does not fully engage with the Christian worldview in discussing the verses. In a future context, it would be important for the student to maintain a focus on the specific religious framework of the question being asked."
