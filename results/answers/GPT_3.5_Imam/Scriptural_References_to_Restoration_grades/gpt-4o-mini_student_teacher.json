  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses that emphasize the theme of restoration, illustrating God's promise to bring healing, abundance, and reconciliation. However, the student missed including key verses like Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6, which more specifically highlight God's promise of restoration and renewal. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the specific verses that directly address the theme of restoration in one's faith journey would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
