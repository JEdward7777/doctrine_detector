  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer is well-written and provides relevant biblical verses that emphasize the theme of restoration. However, it lacks a Christian-specific worldview by focusing on verses from the Islamic Qur'an rather than the Bible as instructed in the prompt. Additionally, the student did not address the specific concern of finding scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey."
