## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_to_Restoration.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, the Qur'an is the primary scripture that we follow, however, I can share with you some relevant verses from the Bible that emphasize the theme of restoration:

1. Joel 2:25-26 - "I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you. You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame." This verse illustrates God's promise to restore what has been lost and to bring abundance and satisfaction to His people.

2. Jeremiah 30:17 - "For I will restore health to you, and your wounds I will heal, declares the Lord, because they have called you an outcast: 'It is Zion, for whom no one cares!'" This verse shows God's promise to bring healing and restoration to those who have been outcast or oppressed.

3. Ezekiel 36:24 - "For I will take you from the nations, gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land." This verse speaks of God's promise to restore His people to their homeland, illustrating His faithfulness and sovereignty in fulfilling His promises.

These verses emphasize the theme of restoration in the Bible, highlighting God's ability and willingness to bring healing, abundance, and reconciliation to His people.

**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:**

The student's answer is well-written and provides relevant biblical verses that emphasize the theme of restoration. However, it lacks a Christian-specific worldview by focusing on verses from the Islamic Qur'an rather than the Bible as instructed in the prompt. Additionally, the student did not address the specific concern of finding scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey.
