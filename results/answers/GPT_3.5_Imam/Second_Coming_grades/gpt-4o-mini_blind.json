However, the response fails to address the Christian specific worldview of the question. It is important to note that the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds is a unique and significant belief within Christianity, primarily associated with the second coming of Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament. Therefore, the answer would benefit from emphasizing the doctrinal differences between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding this concept, rather than solely focusing on Islamic eschatology. Additionally, highlighting the theological implications and significance of this event for Christian believers would have strengthened the response."
