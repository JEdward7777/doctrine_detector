  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of Islamic eschatological beliefs regarding the return of Prophet Isa (Jesus) but strays far from the Christian-specific perspective requested in the question. The answer lacks a focus on the implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' for Christian hope and eschatology. While the student did draw some parallels between Islamic and Christian beliefs, the response did not directly address the unique significance of Jesus' return for Christian believers. Additionally, there was a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the theological implications and importance of Jesus' return specifically within Christian theology."
