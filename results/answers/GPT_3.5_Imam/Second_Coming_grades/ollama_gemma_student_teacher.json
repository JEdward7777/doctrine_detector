While the reference answer focuses on Christ's identity as the Messiah, the student correctly points out that Islamic eschatology shares similarities with this concept. \n\nThe answer is well-researched and clearly explains the Islamic perspective on the return of Prophet Isa as a sign of the end times. It also highlights the potential tribulations and ultimate triumph of righteousness associated with this event. \n\nThe conclusion effectively connects the Islamic belief in the return of Prophet Isa to the Christian concept of Jesus' return, highlighting the hope and fulfillment of God's promises. \n\nOverall, this is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
