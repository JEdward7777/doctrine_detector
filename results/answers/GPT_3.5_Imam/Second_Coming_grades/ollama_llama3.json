While it mentions that the return of Prophet Isa holds similar significance in Islamic eschatology, it does not explore how this compares to the Christian concept of the 'Son of Man' returning on the clouds.\n\nThe response also lacks a clear connection to the given answer, which emphasizes Jesus' return as the Messiah and the fulfillment of God's promises. The provided information is more focused on Islamic beliefs and teachings rather than exploring the implications for Christian hope and eschatology. To improve, the response could have provided more direct comparisons between Islamic and Christian eschatologies, and explored the significance of Jesus' second coming in relation to Christian hope and promises."
