However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about the implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' for Christian hope and eschatology. The response remains focused on Islamic beliefs without drawing a clear comparison or analysis with Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' return as the 'Son of Man'. A more in-depth comparison and reflection on the unique aspects of Jesus' second coming in Christian theology would have been beneficial for addressing the specified concern effectively."
