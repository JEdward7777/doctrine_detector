The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the similarities and differences between Christian and Islamic perspectives on the concept of a significant figure returning in the end times. However, the response could have delved deeper into how the specific Christian belief in Jesus' return as the 'Son of Man' impacts Christian hope and eschatology. Nonetheless, the student effectively addressed the concern and highlighted the shared significance of these events for believers in both faith traditions."
