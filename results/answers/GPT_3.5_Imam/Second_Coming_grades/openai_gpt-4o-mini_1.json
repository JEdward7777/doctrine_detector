It accurately contrasts this belief with the Christian concept of the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds. However, the response falls short in directly addressing the concern by not explicitly linking the implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' to Christian hope and eschatology. More explicit connections between the two beliefs would have strengthened the response."
