## [Answer](../Second_Coming.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the concept of the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran. However, there are similar concepts in Islamic eschatology regarding the return of Prophet Isa (Jesus) as a sign of the Day of Judgment.

According to Islamic teachings, Prophet Isa (Jesus) is believed to have been raised up to the heavens by Allah and will return to Earth before the Day of Judgment. His return is a sign of the final days and the impending end of the world. This event will have significant implications for believers, as it will mark a period of great trials and tribulations, but also a time of justice and righteousness prevailing on Earth.

Muslims believe that Prophet Isa will return as a just leader and will follow the laws of Islam. His return signifies the ultimate triumph of truth over falsehood and the victory of believers over disbelievers. It is a reminder for believers to stay steadfast in their faith and prepare for the Day of Judgment.

In conclusion, while the concept of the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds is specific to Christian beliefs, the return of Prophet Isa in Islamic eschatology holds similar significance for believers in terms of signaling the end times and the ultimate victory of righteousness. Muslims are encouraged to remain steadfast in their faith and strive to lead a righteous life in anticipation of these prophesied events.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response does a good job of explaining the Islamic belief regarding the return of Prophet Isa (Jesus) and its significance in eschatology. It accurately contrasts this belief with the Christian concept of the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds. However, the response falls short in directly addressing the concern by not explicitly linking the implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' to Christian hope and eschatology. More explicit connections between the two beliefs would have strengthened the response.
