It acknowledges the differences in terminology and concepts between Christianity and Islam, accurately stating that the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds is specific to Christian beliefs. However, the response could have delved deeper into the implications of Jesus\u2019 second coming as the 'Son of Man' specifically for Christian hope and eschatology, which was the specified concern. More direct connections between the concepts in the given answer and the Christian perspective would have strengthened the response."
