  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: This student's response is informative and well-organized, showcasing an understanding of the dangers of exalting oneself in Islam. However, the answer diverges from the provided biblical teachings as well as the concerns about recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride. The response should have focused more on how exalting oneself leads to pride, arrogance, and separation from God, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student displayed good critical thinking but missed aligning the response with the specific concern given."
