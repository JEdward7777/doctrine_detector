  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student has demonstrated a good understanding of the Pharisees' beliefs and motivations for wanting to separate the Jewish people from the Gentiles. They have included relevant information about the Pharisees' strict adherence to Jewish laws and their belief in the superiority of the Jewish people. \n\nHowever, the student could improve their answer by directly addressing the concern provided in the question, which is rooted in the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context. The student's explanation does touch on this concern indirectly by mentioning the Pharisees' desire to maintain the purity of the Jewish faith and protect it from outside influences, but a more explicit connection to the given concern would strengthen the response."
