  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the Pharisees' concern about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles. It provides a clear explanation of the Pharisees' belief in the purity of Judaism and their desire to preserve it from outside influences. Additionally, the student acknowledges the existence of other Jewish sects with different perspectives on relations with Gentiles. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the Pharisees' theological or scriptural basis for their separationist beliefs."
