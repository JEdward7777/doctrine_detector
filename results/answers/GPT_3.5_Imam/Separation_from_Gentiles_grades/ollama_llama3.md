## [Answer](../Separation_from_Gentiles.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The Pharisees were a Jewish sect during the time of Jesus, known for their strict adherence to the Torah and their emphasis on purity and separation from Gentiles. They believed that Gentiles were impure and considered them as "unclean" because they did not follow the laws and rituals of Jewish religious practices.

The Pharisees' concern about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles was rooted in their desire to maintain the ethnic and religious identity of the Jewish people. They believed that by avoiding contact with Gentiles, they could preserve the purity of the Jewish faith and protect it from outside influences.

Additionally, the Pharisees were also motivated by a sense of superiority and exclusivity, viewing themselves as the chosen people of God and believing that they were morally and spiritually superior to the Gentiles. By emphasizing separation from Gentiles, the Pharisees sought to maintain their sense of religious purity and uniqueness as a community.

However, it is important to note that not all Jews held the same views as the Pharisees, and there were other Jewish sects and groups, such as the Essenes and the Sadducees, who had different perspectives on relations with Gentiles.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response effectively captures the Pharisees' concern about separating themselves from Gentiles in order to maintain their religious purity and adherence to Jewish laws and traditions. The response also provides some context for why the Pharisees held this view, mentioning their desire to preserve the purity of the Jewish faith and protect it from outside influences.

The response does a good job of highlighting the Pharisees' motivations and concerns, and it even mentions that not all Jews shared these views, which adds nuance to the discussion. The only area for improvement is that the response could provide more detail and depth on the Pharisees' views and practices, as well as their interactions with Gentiles.

The concern that the response addresses - the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context - is also relevant and well-covered in the response. Overall, this is a strong response that effectively captures the Pharisees' concerns and motivations.

Comment: This response would be even stronger if it delved deeper into the Pharisees' practices and interactions with Gentiles, as well as explored the implications of their views on relationships between Jews and Gentiles in Jesus' time.
