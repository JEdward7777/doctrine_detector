## [Answer](../Separation_from_Gentiles.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The Pharisees were a Jewish sect during the time of Jesus, known for their strict adherence to the Torah and their emphasis on purity and separation from Gentiles. They believed that Gentiles were impure and considered them as "unclean" because they did not follow the laws and rituals of Jewish religious practices.

The Pharisees' concern about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles was rooted in their desire to maintain the ethnic and religious identity of the Jewish people. They believed that by avoiding contact with Gentiles, they could preserve the purity of the Jewish faith and protect it from outside influences.

Additionally, the Pharisees were also motivated by a sense of superiority and exclusivity, viewing themselves as the chosen people of God and believing that they were morally and spiritually superior to the Gentiles. By emphasizing separation from Gentiles, the Pharisees sought to maintain their sense of religious purity and uniqueness as a community.

However, it is important to note that not all Jews held the same views as the Pharisees, and there were other Jewish sects and groups, such as the Essenes and the Sadducees, who had different perspectives on relations with Gentiles.
