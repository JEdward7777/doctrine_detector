However, it could be enhanced by acknowledging the Pharisees' motivations for viewing themselves as superior and exclusive, as well as the diversity of perspectives among different Jewish sects. Additionally, the response would benefit from a deeper exploration of how the Pharisees' concern relates to the broader theological implications of faith and cultural engagement within a Christian worldview."
