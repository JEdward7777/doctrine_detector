However, it lacks a deeper analysis from a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, the Pharisees' emphasis on separation can be seen as a distortion of God's original intention for the Jewish people to be a light to the Gentiles (Isaiah 49:6). Jesus challenged the Pharisees' exclusivity and highlighted the importance of reaching out to all people with the message of salvation. A more comprehensive evaluation through a Christian lens would have added depth to the response."
