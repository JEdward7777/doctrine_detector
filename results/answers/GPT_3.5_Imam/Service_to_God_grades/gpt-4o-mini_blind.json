However, the response falls short when it comes to the foundational belief in Christ as the only way to salvation and the centrality of the Gospel message in Christian ministry according to Christian doctrine. This response would benefit from a clearer emphasis on Jesus Christ as the Savior and the importance of repentance and faith in Him for salvation."
