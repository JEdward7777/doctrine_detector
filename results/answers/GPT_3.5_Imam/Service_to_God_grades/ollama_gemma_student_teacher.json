  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ways Christians can serve God in their ministry according to the Bible. The student provides relevant examples of how Christians can engage in ministry, such as preaching, teaching, prayer, acts of charity, and fellowship. However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of actionable ways to engage in ministry, which was the specified concern in the prompt. Additionally, the answer is primarily focused on general concepts rather than practical steps or strategies."
