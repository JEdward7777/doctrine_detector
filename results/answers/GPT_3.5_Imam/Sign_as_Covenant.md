## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, we also recognize the story of Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) and the covenant that God made with humanity after the Great Flood. The rainbow is mentioned in Surah Hud in the Quran as a sign of God's covenant with humanity, just like in the story of Prophet Noah in the Bible.

In Surah Hud, it is mentioned that after the flood subsided, God made a covenant with Prophet Noah and his descendants never to send such a catastrophic flood again. The rainbow is mentioned as a sign of this covenant, a reminder for all of humanity of God's mercy and promise to never destroy the world in such a manner again.

Therefore, just like in the Bible, the rainbow in Islamic belief symbolizes God's mercy, forgiveness, and the promise of protection for humanity. It serves as a reminder of God's covenant with humanity and His faithfulness to His promises.
