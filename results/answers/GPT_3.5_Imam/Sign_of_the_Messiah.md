## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we do not specifically have information about the sign given to the shepherds in the Bible regarding the birth of Jesus (peace be upon him). However, we believe in the miraculous birth of Jesus as mentioned in the Quran, where Mary is given a sign by Allah, and then she gives birth to Jesus. The details of the specific sign given to the shepherds in Luke would not be within the teachings of Islam.

However, the birth of Jesus is a significant event in Islamic belief as well. Muslims believe in the pure and miraculous birth of Jesus through the Virgin Mary, and they hold him in high esteem as one of the mightiest messengers of God.

Ultimately, the key message of Jesus' birth, whether in the Bible or the Quran, is the reminder of God's power, mercy, and love for humanity, and the importance of righteousness, humility, and obedience to God's commands.
