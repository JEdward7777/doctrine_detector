  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful response from an Islamic perspective, highlighting the belief in Jesus as a significant figure in Islam and emphasizing the key messages of his birth. However, the response does not directly address the significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke regarding the birth of Jesus as asked in the question. The answer lacks depth on recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs, which was the specified concern. It's important to directly engage with the question to receive a higher grade."
