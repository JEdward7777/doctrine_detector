It effectively conveys the significance of Jesus' birth as a reminder of God's power, mercy, and love for humanity. However, it could have further emphasized the concept of recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs, especially in relation to the specific sign given to the shepherds in Christianity."
