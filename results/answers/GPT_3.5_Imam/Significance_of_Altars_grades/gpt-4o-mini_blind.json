It correctly highlights the central role of the altar in sacrificial practices and how it symbolized devotion, acknowledgment of God's authority, and seeking forgiveness. The answer effectively connects the act of building altars with repentance, gratitude, and dependence on God. To improve, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of sacrifices on the altar and how they foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ in Christian theology. Additionally, incorporating specific biblical examples or references could enhance the theological depth of the explanation."
