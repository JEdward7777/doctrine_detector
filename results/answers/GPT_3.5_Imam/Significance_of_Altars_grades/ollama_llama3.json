While it does not fully capture the extent of the concern (the concept of sacrifice and devotion), it does touch on the idea of atonement, which is related to these concepts. The response could be improved by further exploring the connection between altars and biblical worship, as well as providing more specific examples or explanations of how understanding altars can help Christians appreciate sacrifice and devotion in their faith."
