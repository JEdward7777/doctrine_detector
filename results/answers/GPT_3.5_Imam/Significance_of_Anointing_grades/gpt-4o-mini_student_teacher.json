  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the significance of anointing in the context of Old Testament priests, kings, and prophets, linking it to being chosen, consecrated, and empowered by God for specific roles. The student effectively supports their points with references to biblical examples. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the central theme of being empowered by God for their roles, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer."
