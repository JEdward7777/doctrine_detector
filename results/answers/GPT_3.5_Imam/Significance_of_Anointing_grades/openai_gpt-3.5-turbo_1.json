The explanation is clear, supported by relevant biblical examples, and effectively articulates how anointing symbolizes being chosen, consecrated, and empowered by God for specific divine purposes. The response effectively addresses the concern and provides a comprehensive overview of the role of anointing in biblical leadership. Great job!"
