It accurately describes the significance of \"Shaddai\" as emphasizing God's power, strength, and sufficiency. The answer also correctly connects the use of \"Shaddai\" as a title to the monotheistic nature of the Abrahamic faiths. However, it could be improved by delving deeper into the theological implications of this translation choice from a Christian perspective and providing more specific examples or references from the Bible to support the explanation."
