However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of deepening the understanding of God's relational aspect and character in the Christian faith, as outlined in the concern. Connecting the concept of personal relationship with God to the translation of \"Shaddai\" would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
