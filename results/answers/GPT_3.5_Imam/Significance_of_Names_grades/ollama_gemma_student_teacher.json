  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. The explanation of the word's meaning and its relationship to God's attributes is accurate and well-articulated. Additionally, the connection between this translation practice and the monotheistic nature of Abrahamic faiths is insightful. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the personal relationship between God and individuals, as per the given concern."
