It also touches on the relational aspect of using \"Shaddai\" as a name, highlighting God's personal connection with His people. While it may not directly address the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character in the Christian faith, it does provide valuable insight into the biblical portrayal of God's attributes and nature. To receive a higher grade, the response could have explicitly connected the concept of \"Shaddai\" to the Christian understanding of God's relational aspect and character.\n\nThe main point of the response aligns with the given answer, stating that translating \"Shaddai\" as a title emphasizes God's attributes, while using it as a name highlights His personal relationship. The concern of deepening the understanding of God's character is indirectly addressed through the discussion on God's omnipotence and strength, but could be further explored to receive a higher grade."
