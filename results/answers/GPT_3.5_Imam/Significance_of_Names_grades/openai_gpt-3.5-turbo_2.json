  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively deepens the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith by explaining the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name. It highlights the attributes of God, such as His omnipotence and strength, while also touching on the importance of a personal relationship with Him. The explanation is clear, insightful, and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
