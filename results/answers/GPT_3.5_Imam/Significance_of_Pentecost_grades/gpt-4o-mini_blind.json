  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer with a score of 90. The response provides a solid explanation of why the Day of Pentecost is significant in the New Testament. It correctly highlights the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples, the empowerment of the early Christians, and the birth of the Christian church. The explanation is doctrinally accurate and effectively conveys the key events and implications of Pentecost according to a Christian worldview. Great job!"
