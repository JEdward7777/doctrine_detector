It effectively highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in equipping Christians for ministry and fulfilling Jesus' promise. The only minor area where improvement could be made is to further emphasize the ongoing guidance, empowerment, and transformative work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers beyond just the initial empowerment at Pentecost."
