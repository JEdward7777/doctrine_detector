  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-articulated response with references to Islamic teachings on bread and righteousness, the answer did not directly address the concern regarding the spiritual significance of unleavened bread in Christian teachings. The student's response lacked a clear connection to the symbolism of unleavened bread in relation to sin and living a life that honors God as outlined in the reference answer. The answer, therefore, falls short in providing a Christian-specific perspective on the topic."
