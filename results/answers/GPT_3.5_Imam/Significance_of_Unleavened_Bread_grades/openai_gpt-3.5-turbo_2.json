However, while it effectively explains the significance of bread in Islam, it does not directly address the Christian perspective on unleavened bread as a symbol of the removal of sin and living a life that honors God, which was the specific concern raised. More direct comparisons and references to Christian teachings on unleavened bread would have enhanced the response further."
