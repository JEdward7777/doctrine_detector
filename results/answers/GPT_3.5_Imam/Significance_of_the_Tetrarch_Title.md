## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The title "tetrarch" refers to a ruler of one of four divisions of a kingdom or province. During the time of Jesus, the region of Judea was under Roman rule, and Herod Antipas was the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. This reveals that the governance structure at that time involved division of regions into smaller administrative units, each under the authority of a tetrarch or governor, who in turn reported to the overall Roman authority. It reflects the complex political landscape and hierarchical structure of power in the Roman Empire during the time of Jesus.
