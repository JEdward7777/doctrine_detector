They correctly identify the division of regions under Roman rule and the role of tetrarchs in administering these areas. The answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning the biblical context of Herod Antipas as the tetrarch mentioned in the New Testament accounts and how his rule intersected with the ministry of Jesus. Additionally, connecting this governance structure to the religious and social dynamics of Judea during that time would enhance the response."
