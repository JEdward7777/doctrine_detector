  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. The student accurately defines the title \"tetrarch\" and explains its significance in the governance structure during the time of Jesus. However, there is more focus on the administrative aspect of the tetrarchy system rather than on the political tensions and implications for believers during Jesus' life and ministry, as indicated in the specified concern. The answer could have connected the governance structure to the political tensions more explicitly to better address the concern provided."
