The discussion about prophets like Moses and Jesus is relevant in a comparative religious studies context, but the focus here should have been on Jesus and the apostles within the Christian framework. Additionally, the mention of the Quran as the source of miracles and signs might not align with the Christian worldview, where the Bible holds that authority. The answer would have been stronger if it had centered on Jesus' miracles recorded in the Bible, their purpose in affirming His divinity, and how they supported the message of salvation through Him."
