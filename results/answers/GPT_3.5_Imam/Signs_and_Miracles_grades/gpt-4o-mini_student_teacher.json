  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and detailed response showcasing the significance of signs and miracles within Islam to validate the message of God. They effectively discussed examples from the Quran regarding Prophet Moses and Prophet Jesus, illustrating how these miracles were used to demonstrate the divine nature of their missions. However, the student did not directly address the key concern of examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation, which was the focus of the question. To improve their answer, they should have connected the importance of signs and miracles to the strengthening of faith and the reception of God's revelation more explicitly."
