  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nWhile the response does mention the significance of signs and miracles in Islam, it primarily focuses on the validation of prophets' messages and the power of God, which aligns with the concern about examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. The response also acknowledges that faith should not be based solely on witnessing miracles, which demonstrates an understanding of the limitations of relying solely on signs.\n\nHowever, the response could have more explicitly connected the significance of signs and miracles in Islam to the broader Christian context, particularly with regards to Jesus and the apostles. Additionally, while the response mentions the Quran's emphasis on reflecting on God's signs in the universe, self, and scripture, it does not delve deeper into the implications for Christian faith.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of signs and miracles in Islam, but could have been more nuanced and explicit in its connections to the broader Christian concern."
