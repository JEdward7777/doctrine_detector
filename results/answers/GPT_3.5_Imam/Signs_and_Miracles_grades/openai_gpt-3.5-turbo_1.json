  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the role of signs and miracles in validating God's power and authority, particularly in the context of Islamic prophets like Moses and Jesus. The response also addresses the importance of faith not solely relying on witnessing miracles but also on reflecting on various signs of God's existence. The incorporation of the Quran's emphasis on contemplating the signs of God in creation and revelation is relevant to the concern provided. The connection between faith, signs, and God's revelation is well-analyzed within an Islamic framework."
