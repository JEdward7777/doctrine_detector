## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the term "Son of God" as it refers to Jesus is understood in a different manner than when the term "sons of God" is used for believers. 

The term "Son of God" for Jesus is often understood in Christian theology to mean a unique and special relationship between Jesus and God, referring to his divine nature and aspect. This term is sometimes used in a literal sense within Christian doctrine to imply Jesus is the literal Son of God.

On the other hand, the term "sons of God" when used for believers in Islamic belief refers to a spiritual relationship with God rather than a literal one. It signifies a special closeness and relationship with God based on faith, devotion, and righteous deeds. In Islamic theology, all believers are considered as servants or slaves of God, highlighting the relationship of submission and devotion to the Creator.

It is important to note that the Islamic perspective emphasizes the oneness of God (Tawhid) and rejects the concept of a literal biological offspring or progeny of God. Muslims believe that God does not beget nor is He begotten, and there is nothing comparable to Him.
