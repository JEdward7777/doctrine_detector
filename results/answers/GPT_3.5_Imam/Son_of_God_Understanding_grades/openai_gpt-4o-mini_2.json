However, it does not fully address the concern about understanding the Christian perspective on the divinity of Jesus and his eternal relationship with God. The explanation provided lacks depth and does not delve into the core theological significance of Jesus being fully God and his eternal relationship with God the Father as understood in Christian doctrine."
