  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides some insights into Islamic beliefs regarding the terms 'Son of God' and 'sons of God', but the response does not directly address the Christian perspective on the distinction between the two terms. The clarity on this distinction for theological discussions is lacking. The student should focus on comparing and contrasting the Christian understanding of these terms to provide a more comprehensive answer."
