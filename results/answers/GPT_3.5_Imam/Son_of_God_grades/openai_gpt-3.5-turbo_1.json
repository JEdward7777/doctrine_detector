  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" for Jesus and \"sons of God\" for believers in Christ, aligning with the Christian belief in Jesus as God's unique and only Son. The response effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the theological understanding within Christian doctrine. The integration of the given answer and the concern is well done. However, it could be strengthened by incorporating more specific Biblical references to support the Christian perspective further."
