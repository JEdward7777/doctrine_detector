However, the answer misses the mark in addressing the Christian concept of believers becoming saints. The response should have focused on the Christian belief that saints are those who have lived a life of exceptional holiness and are recognized for their faithful devotion to God. It would have been helpful to contrast this Christian perspective with the Islamic beliefs presented in the answer."
