## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic faith, we do not have a concept of believers becoming saints as in Christianity. In Islam, all believers are encouraged to strive for righteousness and obedience to Allah in order to attain closeness to Him and ultimately achieve paradise. Saints do not have a specific designation or status in Islam like they do in Christianity. Instead, we believe that all believers have the potential to draw near to Allah through sincere belief, good deeds, and seeking His forgiveness and guidance.

Grade: 30

Comment: The response does a good job of explaining the Islamic perspective on believers striving for closeness to Allah through righteousness and obedience. However, the answer misses the mark in addressing the Christian concept of believers becoming saints. The response should have focused on the Christian belief that saints are those who have lived a life of exceptional holiness and are recognized for their faithful devotion to God. It would have been helpful to contrast this Christian perspective with the Islamic beliefs presented in the answer.
