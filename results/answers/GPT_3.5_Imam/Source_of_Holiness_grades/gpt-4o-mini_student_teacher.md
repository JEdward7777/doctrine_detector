## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic faith, we do not have a concept of believers becoming saints as in Christianity. In Islam, all believers are encouraged to strive for righteousness and obedience to Allah in order to attain closeness to Him and ultimately achieve paradise. Saints do not have a specific designation or status in Islam like they do in Christianity. Instead, we believe that all believers have the potential to draw near to Allah through sincere belief, good deeds, and seeking His forgiveness and guidance.
