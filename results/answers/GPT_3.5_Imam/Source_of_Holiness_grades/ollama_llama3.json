  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThis response does not directly address the concern about clarifying the source of holiness, as it primarily focuses on the differences between Islam and Christianity regarding the concept of saints. While it does mention that believers become saints \"not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ,\" this statement is more relevant to the original answer than the concern.\n\nThe response could be improved by explicitly highlighting how Christian theology emphasizes the role of faith in Jesus as the source of holiness, and how this understanding is distinct from other religious perspectives. By doing so, it would better address the concern and provide a clearer explanation of the central role of faith in Jesus Christ in the Christian doctrine.\n\nComment: This response could be strengthened by providing more explicit connections to the original answer and concern, particularly with regards to clarifying the source of holiness."
