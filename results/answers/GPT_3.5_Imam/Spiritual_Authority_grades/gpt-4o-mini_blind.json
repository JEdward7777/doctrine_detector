  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed explanation of the roles and responsibilities of spiritual authorities and earthly authorities in Islam, the answer does not address the question from a Biblical perspective as instructed. The response also lacks a comparative analysis between spiritual authorities in Islam and Biblical teachings, missing the opportunity to highlight the differences between the two belief systems. The student should focus on addressing the question specifically from a Biblical perspective in future responses."
