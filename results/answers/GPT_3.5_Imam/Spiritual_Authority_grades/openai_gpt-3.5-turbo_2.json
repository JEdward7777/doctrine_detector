  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: While the response provides a clear explanation of how spiritual authorities and earthly authorities are perceived in Islam, it does not address the concern from a Christian worldview. The response lacks a comparison or contrast between the Christian view of spiritual and earthly authorities as outlined in Ephesians 6:12. To improve the grade, the author should incorporate a discussion of Christian beliefs on the roles and distinctions between spiritual and worldly authority as presented in the Bible."
