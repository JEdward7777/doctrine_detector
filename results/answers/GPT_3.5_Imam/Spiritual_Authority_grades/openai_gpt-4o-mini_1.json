  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the roles and authority of spiritual and earthly authorities in Islam. However, the response does not address the concern raised from a Christian worldview, which focuses on the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority as mentioned in Ephesians 6:12. The answer provided does not align with Christian beliefs, so the grade is low."
