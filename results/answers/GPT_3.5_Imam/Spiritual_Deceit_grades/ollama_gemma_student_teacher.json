  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately highlights the Quranic references concerning jinn and their influence on idolatry. They clearly explain how jinn can mislead people and the consequences of their actions. However, the answer is specifically focused on Islamic beliefs and does not directly address the Christian perspective on demons and idolatry as specified in the concern."
