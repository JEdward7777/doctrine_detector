## [Answer](../Spiritual_Deceit.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, demons, or jinn, are believed to play a role in tempting and misleading people away from worshipping Allah alone and towards idolatry. The Quran mentions that some jinn listened to the recitation of the Quran and were so impressed that they embraced Islam, while others continue to mislead people.

In Surah Al-An'am (6:128), it is stated: "And [mention] the Day when He will gather them together and say, 'O company of jinn, you have [misled] many of mankind.' And their allies among mankind will say, 'Our Lord, some of us made use of others, and we have [now] reached our term which You appointed for us.' He will say, 'The Fire is your residence, wherein you will abide eternally, except for what Allah wills. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing.'"

It is important for Muslims to seek protection from the influence of demons by reciting Quranic verses, seeking refuge in Allah, and following the teachings of Islam to stay on the right path and avoid falling into idolatry.
