  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the answer provides a perspective on spiritual gifts from an Islamic viewpoint, it does not directly address the implications of the phrase 'spiritual gifts' as described in the Bible. Additionally, the answer does not align with a Christian worldview, which is the context for grading in this case. In order to improve the grade, the response should focus on discussing the biblical understanding of spiritual gifts and their significance within Christianity."
