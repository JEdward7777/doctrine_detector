  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-written and thoughtful response, the answer did not align with the Christian understanding of spiritual gifts as described in the Bible. The student's perspective from Islamic teachings does not directly address the implications of spiritual gifts within the context of Christianity, which is the primary focus of the question. The student should have focused on the Biblical perspective of spiritual gifts and their role in community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit."
