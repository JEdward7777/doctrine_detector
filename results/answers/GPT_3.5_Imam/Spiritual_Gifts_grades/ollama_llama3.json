The concern was to recognize the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit, but this response does not address this concern at all. It only mentions the Quran's emphasis on recognizing and appreciating spiritual gifts, which is not equivalent to the biblical concept of spiritual gifts given by the Holy Spirit. The response could have been improved by providing a more direct comparison between Islamic teachings and Christian understandings of spiritual gifts, as well as addressing the concern about utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and obedience to the Holy Spirit."
