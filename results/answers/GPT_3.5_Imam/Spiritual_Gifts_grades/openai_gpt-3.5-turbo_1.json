  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on spiritual gifts in relation to Allah's blessings and emphasizes gratitude and using these gifts for the benefit of oneself and others. However, the response does not directly address the concern of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit as presented in the specified answer. The focus is primarily on individual spiritual growth and connection to Allah, lacking a Christian-specific perspective on the purpose of spiritual gifts within the context of building up the church and serving others in love."
