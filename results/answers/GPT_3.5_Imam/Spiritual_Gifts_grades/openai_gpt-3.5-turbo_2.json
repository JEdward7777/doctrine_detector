However, the response does not directly address the concept of spiritual gifts as special abilities given by the Holy Spirit to believers in a Christian context, which is the specified answer. While the response provides valuable insights from an Islamic perspective, it could have been strengthened by directly connecting these teachings to the Christian understanding of spiritual gifts."
