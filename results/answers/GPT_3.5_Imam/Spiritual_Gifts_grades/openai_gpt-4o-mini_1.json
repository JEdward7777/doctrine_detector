While the response does not directly align with the Christian specific view of spiritual gifts attributed to the Holy Spirit for building up the church, it does emphasize the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for personal and community growth in obedience to Allah's teachings. The connection to Christian beliefs on spiritual gifts could have been more explicit to fully address the concern from a Christian worldview."
