  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of \"circumcision of the heart\" in a Christian context, referencing relevant Bible passages and emphasizing the importance of inner transformation and righteousness. While the student's answer elaborated on the symbolism and implications well, it slightly deviated from the reference answer by not explicitly mentioning the role of faith in Jesus Christ as the means for the removal of sin and purification of the heart. Overall, it was a strong response but lacked explicit connection to the core Christian belief in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ."
