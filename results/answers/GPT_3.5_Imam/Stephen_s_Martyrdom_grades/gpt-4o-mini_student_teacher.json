  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response effectively draws parallels between the challenges faced by early Christians and early Muslims, highlighting the importance of faith and perseverance in times of persecution. However, the answer lacks a Christian-specific perspective on the significance of Stephen's stoning within the context of the early Christian church. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on the Christian worldview and the theological implications of martyrdom for believers in Jesus Christ."
