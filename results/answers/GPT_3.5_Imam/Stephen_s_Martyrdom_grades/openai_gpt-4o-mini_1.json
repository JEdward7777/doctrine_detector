However, while it draws parallels between the stoning of Stephen and the challenges faced by early Muslims, it does not directly address the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution from a Christian-specific worldview. It is important to consider the distinct Christian belief in the sacrifice of Jesus for the forgiveness of sins and the call for believers to follow His example, even unto death, in the face of persecution."
