However, since the question specifically asks about the Biblical perspective on stoning for adultery and how it reflects God's justice and mercy, the answer does not directly address those aspects. It would have been more appropriate and accurate to focus on the biblical teachings and theological understandings of stoning for adultery as the basis for evaluation in a Christian worldview context."
