  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of stoning for adultery from an Islamic perspective, which is informative. However, the response did not address the specific concern of balancing God's justice and mercy in His commandments, as it related to the teaching of the Bible. The student's answer, while well-structured and informative, did not directly engage with the given question."
