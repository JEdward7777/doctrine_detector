The response provides insights from an Islamic perspective, highlighting the principles of justice, deterrence, and the importance of due process in Islamic law. \n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from engaging more directly with the Bible and its teachings, as the reference answer provided suggests. Additionally, the student's perspective is limited to Islamic law, while the question specifically asks about the Bible's perspective."
