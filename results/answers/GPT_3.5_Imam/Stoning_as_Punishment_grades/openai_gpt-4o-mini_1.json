The understanding of Islamic law and its emphasis on justice and deterrence aligns well with the concern regarding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. However, the response could have further highlighted the unique Christian perspective on the topic and how it contrasts with the Islamic view, in addition to emphasizing Jesus's teaching on mercy and forgiveness in the context of stoning for adultery."
