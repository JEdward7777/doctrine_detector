However, it could have further emphasized the importance of balancing justice and mercy in God's commandments as demonstrated in the New Testament, especially in contrast to the more severe punishments mentioned in the Old Testament. A more explicit comparison between the Islamic perspective and the Christian view, demonstrating the balance between justice and mercy, would have strengthened the response."
