  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided correct information about the two main sections of the tabernacle and what was located in each, based on general knowledge. However, the answer begins by stating the lack of a concept of the tabernacle in Islamic teaching, which is not relevant to the question asked. The grading is low because it avoids directly engaging with the Christian-specific content of the tabernacle and its significance, missing opportunities to discuss the theological implications and symbolism within a Christian worldview. Straying from the focus on the biblical context impacts the accuracy and depth of the response."
