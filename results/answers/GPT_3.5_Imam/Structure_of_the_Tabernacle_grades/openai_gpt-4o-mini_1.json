It aligns well with the concern about understanding the importance of these elements in worship. However, from a Christian perspective, there is a missing connection to the ultimate purpose of the tabernacle pointing towards Christ as the ultimate sacrifice and mediator between God and humanity. This deeper theological aspect could have been included for a more holistic understanding."
