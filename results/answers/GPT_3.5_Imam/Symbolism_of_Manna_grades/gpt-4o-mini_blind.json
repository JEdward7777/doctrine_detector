The focus on Allah and the Quran deviates from a Christian worldview, which is essential in answering the question effectively. In a Christian context, manna is a symbol of God's faithful provision to the Israelites in the Old Testament, foreshadowing the ultimate provision in Jesus Christ. The answer would have been stronger if it had incorporated Christian beliefs and scriptures regarding manna."
