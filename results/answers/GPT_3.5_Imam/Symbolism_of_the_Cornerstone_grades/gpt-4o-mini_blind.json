  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the Islamic perspective on the relationship between Prophet Isa and his followers, focusing on guidance, righteousness, and monotheism. However, the answer misses the point of the question, which specifically asks about the metaphor of the cornerstone in relation to Jesus and His followers in Christianity. The grading is low due to the lack of addressing the Christian doctrine of Jesus as the cornerstone and the unique relationship between Jesus and His followers in Christian belief."
