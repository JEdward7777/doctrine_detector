  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation of the Islamic perspective on the relationship between Prophet Isa and his followers, but missed the mark on addressing the specific concern of understanding the relationship between Jesus and His followers from a Christian perspective. The answer did not align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasized that Jesus is the cornerstone as the source of strength and reference point for believers' lives and faith. The student's response, while informative about Islamic beliefs, did not effectively address the context of the Christian metaphor of the cornerstone."
