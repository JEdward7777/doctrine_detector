## [Answer](../Symbolism_of_the_Cornerstone.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered a prophet and messenger of Allah, not divine or the literal son of God. So, the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone, often mentioned in Christian theology, holds a different meaning in Islam.

From an Islamic perspective, the relationship between Prophet Isa and his followers can be seen in terms of guidance, righteousness, and the message of monotheism. Muslims believe that all prophets, including Prophet Isa, were sent by Allah to guide humanity towards the worship of one God.

The Quran emphasizes the importance of following the teachings and guidance of the prophets, including Prophet Isa. In this sense, Prophet Isa can be seen as a cornerstone in the foundation of faith, representing the importance of following the path of righteousness and monotheism laid out by the prophets.

Muslims are encouraged to learn from the example of Prophet Isa and his followers, as well as all the prophets mentioned in the Quran, in order to strengthen their own faith, improve their character, and uphold the values of justice, compassion, and service to others.

In conclusion, the metaphor of the cornerstone can be applied in an Islamic context to illustrate the foundational role of the prophets in guiding and instructing their followers in the worship of Allah and the practice of righteousness.

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the metaphor of the cornerstone and its application within an Islamic context. It clearly explains the foundational role of the prophets in guiding and instructing followers in the worship of Allah and the practice of righteousness. However, the answer does not directly address the Christian specific worldview as requested in the prompt.
