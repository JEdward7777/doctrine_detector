  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The response does an excellent job of explaining how Islamic belief views Jesus (Prophet Isa) and his relationship with his followers, which aligns well with the concern about understanding Christ's teachings and example.\n* The author provides clear examples from the Quran to support their points, showing a good grasp of Islamic theology.\n* The conclusion effectively applies the cornerstone metaphor to illustrate the prophetic role in guiding believers towards righteousness.\n\nWhere the response falls short is that it doesn't explicitly connect Jesus/Prophet Isa's teachings and example to Christ's teachings and example. While this connection is implicit in the response, it could be strengthened by making it more explicit.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade (e.g., 90-100), the response could further emphasize the importance of aligning one's life with Christ's teachings and example, using specific examples from Jesus' life or teachings to illustrate this point."
