  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a limited understanding of the significance of lamb sacrifices in the Bible and their relation to atonement. While they correctly point out the symbolic significance of the lamb as representing innocence and purity, their response lacks depth and fails to address the specific concern of the prompt, which relates to the Christian worldview. The response also includes inaccurate information about sacrifices in Islam, which is irrelevant to the question."
