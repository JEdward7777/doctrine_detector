However, it did not address the concern provided. The response did not engage with the Christian perspective on atonement and the symbolism of the lamb in relation to Christ's sacrifice for redemption. For a higher grade, the answer should have integrated the Christian worldview into the discussion and compared it with the Islamic perspective on sacrifices and atonement."
