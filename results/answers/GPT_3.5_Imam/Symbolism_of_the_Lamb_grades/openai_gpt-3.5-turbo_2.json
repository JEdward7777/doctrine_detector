However, it did not directly address the concern about the symbolism of the lamb in Christian understanding of atonement and redemption through Christ. A higher grade could have been achieved by incorporating more discussion on how the concept of sacrificing a lamb for atonement in Christianity parallels the sacrifice of Jesus as the Lamb of God for the redemption of humanity's sins."
