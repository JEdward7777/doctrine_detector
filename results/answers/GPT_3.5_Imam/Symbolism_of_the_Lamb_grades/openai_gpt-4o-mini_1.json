However, it does not directly address the concern raised about the symbolism of the lamb and its significance in Christian understanding of atonement and redemption through Christ. To improve the grade, the response could have made a comparison or contrast between the Islamic understanding of sacrifice and the Christian belief in the sacrificial lamb representing Christ's atonement for the sins of humanity."
