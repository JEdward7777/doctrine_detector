However, it does not address the concern raised regarding the Christian perspective on the symbolism of the lamb in sacrifices and its connection to atonement and redemption through Christ. The response would benefit from incorporating a Christian worldview perspective on the symbolism of the lamb in relation to atonement and redemption."
