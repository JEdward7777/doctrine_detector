  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that aligns well with the purpose of the temple in the context of Old Testament worship. They accurately described the temple as a central place of worship, sacrifice, and the dwelling place of God on Earth. However, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes the temple as a place for prayer and sacrifices, which the student's answer elaborated on but not explicitly stated. Hence, deducting some points for not directly reflecting the teacher's response."
