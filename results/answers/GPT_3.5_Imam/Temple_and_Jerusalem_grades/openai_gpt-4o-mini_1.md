The term "Zion" has roots in ancient Hebrew and is often used as a synonym for Jerusalem, particularly in a spiritual or religious context. The association of "Zion" with the temple located in Jerusalem can be traced back to the Bible, where it is used to signify the spiritual center of the city.

In Islamic tradition, Jerusalem holds great significance as a holy site, particularly the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is believed to be the third holiest site in Islam after the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. While the term "Zion" is more commonly used in Jewish and Christian traditions, the spiritual significance of Jerusalem extends to Muslims as well.

Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of how "Zion" became associated with the temple due to its geographical location on the prominent hills in Jerusalem. It effectively addresses the concern by tying together the geographical significance of the location with its theological importance in relation to Zion. The integration of both aspects demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview, though it could have delved deeper into the theological implications of this geographical connection.
