  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments. The explanation of the shift in understanding from a physical temple to believers being the temple of God is insightful. However, for a higher grade, more specific biblical references could have been provided in the New Testament section to support the points made. Additionally, further elaboration on the significance of believers as temples of God in light of Christ's sacrifice could enhance the response."
