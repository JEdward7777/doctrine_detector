They accurately mention specific passages to support their points and acknowledge the shift from a physical building to believers being the temple of God in the New Testament. However, the student could further enhance their answer by directly referencing believers in Jesus as the 'temple of the Holy Spirit' in the New Testament, as highlighted in the reference answer. This would strengthen the theological implications of God dwelling among His people from a Christian worldview."
