However, it could be strengthened by more explicitly exploring the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, which is the primary concern.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the shift from a physical temple to a spiritual understanding in the New Testament, but it could delve deeper into what this means for our understanding of God's presence and activity in the world. Additionally, while it mentions the importance of living lives that reflect God's holiness and glory, it could further develop this idea by exploring how this impacts our daily lives and worship practices.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the concept of God dwelling among His people, but could benefit from more theological depth and application."
