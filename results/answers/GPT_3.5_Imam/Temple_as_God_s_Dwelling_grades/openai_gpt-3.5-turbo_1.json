It accurately highlights the shift in understanding from a physical temple to believers being temples of the Holy Spirit. The response could have been strengthened by delving deeper into the theological implications of God's presence among His people, perhaps by discussing the significance of believers being temples of the Holy Spirit in terms of sanctification and living holy lives."
