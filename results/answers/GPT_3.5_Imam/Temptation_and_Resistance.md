## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Jesus, known as Isa in Arabic, is considered one of the great prophets of Allah. In the Quran, the story of Jesus being tempted by Satan is not mentioned in the same detail as it is in the Bible. However, there are references to Jesus being tested and displaying great patience and reliance on Allah throughout his life.

One of the core beliefs in Islam is the concept of prophets being free from major sins and protected from committing serious wrongdoings. Therefore, Muslims believe that Jesus, being a prophet, would have definitely resisted any temptations presented by Satan.

It is important to remember that the primary focus of Jesus' mission in Islam is to convey the message of monotheism and submission to Allah, rather than the specific details of his individual encounters with Satan. Muslims believe that Jesus' response to any temptation would align with his dedication to fulfilling the will of Allah and upholding moral integrity.
