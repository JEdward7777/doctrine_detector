  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40 \n\nComment: The student's answer provides insightful information about the Islamic perspective on Jesus and his resistance to temptation. However, the response does not directly address how Jesus responded to the temptations presented by Satan as described in the Bible. The student also does not connect Jesus' example of resistance to temptation as a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil, which was the specified concern. A stronger connection to the question and concern would enhance the grade."
