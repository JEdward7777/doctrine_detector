However, the student's answer does not adequately address the concern about its relevance to Christians in their spiritual battles against evil. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to emphasize Jesus as the ultimate example for believers to follow in overcoming temptations and relying on God's strength in times of trial. This connection could have been more explicitly articulated in the response."
