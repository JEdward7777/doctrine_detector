  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective when the question specifically asked for an answer based on Biblical teaching. While the answer provides valuable insights into the Islamic faith's views on tempting God, it misses the mark in directly addressing the Biblical understanding of the concept. Additionally, the answer lacks references to specific Biblical passages or principles, which would have strengthened the argument and connected it more closely to the question's context."
