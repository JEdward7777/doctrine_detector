  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer is incorrect as it discusses Muslim teachings rather than Christian teachings regarding the terms used for the Lord's Supper. The student also misses the primary terms 'communion' and 'Last Supper' that are commonly used in Christian communities. Additionally, the understanding of the significance of the Lord's Supper from a Christian perspective is incomplete. More focus on Christian terminology and beliefs would have improved the answer."
