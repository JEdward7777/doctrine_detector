  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 50/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is relevant to the concern but does not address the question. It discusses the Eucharist in Muslim teachings instead of Christian communities. The answer also contains inaccurate information as it refers to the Eucharist as a Muslim teaching. The correct terms for the Lord's Supper in Christian communities are 'communion' and 'Last Supper', as stated in the reference answer."
