In Muslim teachings and terminology, the Lord's Supper in Christian communities is referred to as the Eucharist or Holy Communion. This is a sacred ritual where Christians symbolically commemorate and partake in the last supper of Jesus Christ with his disciples before his crucifixion. It is seen as a way for believers to affirm their faith in Jesus as the Son of God and to remember his sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.

Comment: The response acknowledges some of the terms used within Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper, which aligns with the concern provided. However, it lacks depth and does not fully explore the significance of the practice within Christian beliefs and teachings. A stronger answer would have delved into the theological implications and symbolism of the Eucharist in Christian theology.
