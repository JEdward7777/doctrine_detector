The alternative terms presented are relevant and give insight into the Islamic religious leadership structure. However, from a Christian perspective, it would have been beneficial for the student to include a brief explanation of the role of a deacon in Christianity to draw a clearer comparison. Additionally, it would have been helpful to acknowledge the doctrinal differences between Islam and Christianity in their response."
