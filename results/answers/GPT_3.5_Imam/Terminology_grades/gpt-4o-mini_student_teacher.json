  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched response, offering alternative terms within the Islamic community that fulfill similar roles to a deacon in Christianity. However, the concern specified identifying service roles within the Christian church, and the student did not directly address this aspect. While the student demonstrated knowledge of parallel roles in Islam, the answer did not align with the specific Christian worldview context provided in the reference answer."
