  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the different roles within both Christianity and Islam. They accurately point out that the concept of a deacon is not directly equivalent to any singular role in Islam, but they effectively suggest alternative terms that fulfill similar functions. The inclusion of specific examples like Imams, Sheikhs, Scholars, and Khatibs strengthens the response and demonstrates a comprehensive knowledge of Islamic leadership structures. \n\nWhile the student's answer does not directly address the concern about recognizing various service roles within the church, it successfully expands the understanding of leadership positions across different religious contexts."
