  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by providing alternative terms within Islam that signify roles similar to a deacon in Christianity. The explanation is clear and relevant, showing an understanding of service roles within different religious contexts. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included a brief comparison of the roles of a deacon in Christianity with those alternative roles in Islam to highlight similarities and differences more explicitly."
