The concern is partially addressed by recognizing that the terms are often used interchangeably, but the response does not explicitly highlight how this understanding can help in comprehending the context and audience of Biblical texts. To improve, the response could provide more detailed examples or explanations about how considering these terms can deepen our understanding of the Bible's message and its intended audience."
