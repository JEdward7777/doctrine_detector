  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of testimony in the context of the Bible, particularly regarding the commandments of God. The student provides clear examples from both the Old and New Testaments to support their claims. The response is well-written and demonstrates a thoughtful analysis of the topic. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher is not entirely relevant to the student's answer, as it relates to the tablets of stone rather than the concept of testimony in general."
