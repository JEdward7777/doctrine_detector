  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of why putting God to the test is considered wrong in Islam, highlighting the importance of faith, humility, and submission to Allah's will. The writer effectively uses Islamic concepts, such as the All-Knowing, All-Wise, and All-Powerful nature of Allah, to support their argument.\n\nWhile the response does not directly address the concern about maintaining a proper relationship with God, it is implied that recognizing this principle is essential for building a healthy relationship with Allah. The writer's emphasis on trust, faith, and patience in waiting for God's decree also aligns with the concern.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have explicitly connected the principle to the concern about maintaining a proper relationship with God. Nevertheless, the overall quality of the response and its coherence with Islamic teachings earn it an 85-grade."
