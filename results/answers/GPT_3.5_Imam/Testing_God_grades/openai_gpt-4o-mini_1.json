It emphasizes the importance of faith, humility, and submission to Allah's will. The connection between proper relationship with God and the principle discussed is clearly presented. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern provided. However, as per a Christian worldview, it would be important to also emphasize the aspect of obedience to God's commands and His revealed will through Scripture."
