  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of how testing and temptation are viewed in Islamic teachings, but the student missed the mark in addressing the question from a biblical context. The focus should have been on differentiating between testing and temptation in a biblical framework, rather than comparing it to Islamic teachings. Additionally, there is a lack of specific references to biblical examples or teachings to support the explanation. The student could improve by delving deeper into the biblical perspective and drawing clearer distinctions between testing and temptation as understood in Christianity."
