  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concepts of testing and temptation in Islamic teachings, which demonstrates good knowledge and comprehension. However, the student did not address the concern of differentiating between testing and temptation specifically in a biblical context. The response focused solely on the Islamic perspective without drawing a clear distinction based on the reference answer provided by the teacher. To improve the grade, the student should have directly compared and contrasted the Islamic and biblical perspectives on testing and temptation to showcase a deeper understanding of the concern raised."
