  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of Islamic teachings on testing and temptation, and it makes some relevant connections to biblical concepts. The distinction between tests (opportunities for growth) and temptations (allure towards sinful behavior) is well-explained, and the importance of seeking guidance from scripture and tradition is emphasized.\n\nHowever, in terms of differentiating between testing and temptation, the response could have gone further in highlighting the key differences with a biblical perspective. While it mentions that tests are meant to strengthen faith and character, whereas temptations are trials of commitment to following Islamic teachings, the response does not fully address the concern that God does not initiate sin (temptation). This limitation is reflected in the grade.\n\nA higher grade would require more explicit engagement with the biblical concept of temptation as an invitation to sin, which is not initiated by God. Nevertheless, the response shows a good understanding of Islamic teachings on these topics and demonstrates a willingness to engage in interfaith dialogue."
