# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, Herod Antipas, also known as Herod the tetrarch, is mentioned in connection to several significant events:

1. **Role in the Death of John the Baptist:** Herod Antipas is most commonly known for his role in the death of John the Baptist. According to the Gospels of Matthew (14:1-12) and Mark (6:14-29), Herod Antipas had John the Baptist arrested and eventually executed due to a promise he made to his stepdaughter Salome after she pleased him with her dancing.

2. **Role in the Trial of Jesus:** Herod Antipas is also mentioned in the Gospel of Luke, where he is involved in the trial of Jesus. Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, initially sent Jesus to Herod Antipas because Jesus was from Galilee, which was under Herod's jurisdiction. However, Herod Antipas found no guilt in Jesus and sent him back to Pilate.

3. **Reference in the Book of Acts:** In the Book of Acts (4:27), Herod Antipas is mentioned as being part of the conspiracy against Jesus. This reference highlights the role of political leaders in opposing the early Christian community.

Overall, Herod Antipas is portrayed in the New Testament as a figure who played a significant part in the events surrounding John the Baptist and Jesus, particularly in the context of political power and the interactions between the Roman authorities and the Jewish people of that time.
