In the context of belief in Jesus within Islam, the phrase "keep the faith" means to hold fast to one's belief in Jesus as a messenger and prophet of God. It entails maintaining a strong and unwavering faith in the teachings and message that Jesus conveyed during his time on earth. This includes believing in his miraculous birth to the Virgin Mary, his ability to perform miracles by the will of God, and his eventual return in the future.
