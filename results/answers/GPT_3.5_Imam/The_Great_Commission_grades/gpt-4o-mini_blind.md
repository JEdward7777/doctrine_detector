## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic belief, Jesus (Isa) is considered a Prophet, not the Son of God as in Christianity. In Islam, it is believed that Jesus did not actually die but was raised to heaven by Allah. Therefore, there is no specific account of Jesus giving any command to his disciples before ascending to heaven in Islamic teachings. However, in Islamic belief, it is understood that Prophets generally taught their followers to worship and obey Allah, and to follow the righteous path.

Grade: 30

Comment: The response does not directly address the question about Jesus giving a command to His disciples before ascending to heaven within a Christian worldview. It primarily provides information on the Islamic belief about Jesus, which is not relevant to the question asked. The focus should have been on Jesus' teachings and commands as recorded in the Bible for a more accurate and relevant response.
