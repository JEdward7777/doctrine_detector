## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic belief, Jesus (Isa) is considered a Prophet, not the Son of God as in Christianity. In Islam, it is believed that Jesus did not actually die but was raised to heaven by Allah. Therefore, there is no specific account of Jesus giving any command to his disciples before ascending to heaven in Islamic teachings. However, in Islamic belief, it is understood that Prophets generally taught their followers to worship and obey Allah, and to follow the righteous path.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: The student's response, while informative about Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus, does not directly address the question about the specific command Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven. The relevance of Islamic beliefs to the context of the Great Commission is not adequately demonstrated in the answer. The focus should have been on understanding Jesus' command within a Christian worldview and its significance for discipleship.
