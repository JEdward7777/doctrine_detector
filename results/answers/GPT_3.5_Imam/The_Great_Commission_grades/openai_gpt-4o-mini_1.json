The student's focus on Islamic beliefs about Jesus and the absence of specific commands given to disciples before his ascension in Islam, while interesting information, does not directly engage with the concern raised. In a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of the Great Commission and the specific commands given by Jesus to his disciples is crucial for understanding the mission of discipleship."
