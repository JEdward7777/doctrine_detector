## Question [The Great Commission](../../../questions/The_Great_Commission.md)
What command did Jesus give to His disciples before ascending to heaven?

## Correct Answer
Jesus commanded His disciples to make other disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey everything He had commanded.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission.

## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic belief, Jesus (Isa) is considered a Prophet, not the Son of God as in Christianity. In Islam, it is believed that Jesus did not actually die but was raised to heaven by Allah. Therefore, there is no specific account of Jesus giving any command to his disciples before ascending to heaven in Islamic teachings. However, in Islamic belief, it is understood that Prophets generally taught their followers to worship and obey Allah, and to follow the righteous path.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided does not adequately address the concern regarding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission. The student's focus on Islamic beliefs about Jesus and the absence of specific commands given to disciples before his ascension in Islam, while interesting information, does not directly engage with the concern raised. In a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of the Great Commission and the specific commands given by Jesus to his disciples is crucial for understanding the mission of discipleship.
