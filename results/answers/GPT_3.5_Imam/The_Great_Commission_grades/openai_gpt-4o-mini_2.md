## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Islamic belief, Jesus (Isa) is considered a Prophet, not the Son of God as in Christianity. In Islam, it is believed that Jesus did not actually die but was raised to heaven by Allah. Therefore, there is no specific account of Jesus giving any command to his disciples before ascending to heaven in Islamic teachings. However, in Islamic belief, it is understood that Prophets generally taught their followers to worship and obey Allah, and to follow the righteous path.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided does not address the concern raised about the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission. The Islamic perspective shared is informative, but it does not engage with the Christian specific worldview regarding Jesus' command to His disciples. To improve the grade, the writer should have integrated the Christian belief about the Great Commission and the significance of discipleship according to Christian doctrine.
