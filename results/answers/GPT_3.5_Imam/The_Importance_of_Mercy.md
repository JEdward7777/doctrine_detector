## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I do not interpret the New Testament verses from the Bible. However, in Islam, the concept of mercy plays a fundamental role in God's judgment of us. In Islamic teachings, God's mercy is vast and all-encompassing, outweighing His wrath. The Quran mentions numerous times that God is Most Merciful and Most Compassionate.

In Islam, it is believed that God's mercy outweighs His judgment, and He forgives those who sincerely repent and seek His forgiveness. The principle of mercy is central to Islamic teachings on judgment, as God is seen as the Most Merciful and Forgiving. Muslims are encouraged to show mercy and compassion towards others in their daily lives, as it is believed that they will receive the same in return from God on the Day of Judgment.
