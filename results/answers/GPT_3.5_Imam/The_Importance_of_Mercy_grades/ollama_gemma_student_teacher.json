  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of mercy in Islamic teachings and its significance in God's judgment. However, it does not directly address the specific passage from James 2:13 or provide a Christian-specific interpretation of the verse. The inclusion of Islamic perspectives on mercy and judgment is relevant but does not fully address the concern from the prompt."
