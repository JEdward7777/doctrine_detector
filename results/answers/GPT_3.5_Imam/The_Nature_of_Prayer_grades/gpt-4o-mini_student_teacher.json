  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student accurately explains the concept of prayer in Islam and distinguishes it from talking to a false god. They correctly highlight the importance of prayer in Islam as a way to connect with Allah and seek guidance. The student also correctly identifies that talking to a false god, such as idols or false deities, is prohibited in Islam due to the belief in the oneness of Allah.\n\nHowever, the student's answer lacks a direct comparison to the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes the importance of true spiritual communion and a relationship with the divine when praying. While the student's answer is informative and accurate, it could be improved by directly contrasting it with the reference answer to better address the concern of understanding the proper approach to prayer and distinguishing it from false practices."
