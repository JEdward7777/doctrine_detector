## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Allah has established guidance for humanity through the revelation of the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). When Allah says in the Quran that He writes His law on the hearts of people, it means that He guides and inspires individuals to understand and follow His commands. This guidance is internalized within the hearts of believers, leading them to act in accordance with His will.

It is a beautiful concept that reflects the idea that believers should have a deep and personal connection with Allah and His teachings. By having God's laws written on our hearts, we are reminded to constantly strive towards righteousness and to embody the values of compassion, justice, and mercy in our actions and interactions with others.

Ultimately, it is a reminder that the true source of guidance and wisdom comes from Allah, and that by following His commands with sincerity and devotion, we can lead a life that is pleasing to Him.
