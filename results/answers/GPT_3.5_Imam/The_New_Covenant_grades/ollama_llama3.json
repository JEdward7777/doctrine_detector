  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of God's laws being written on people's hearts, drawing from Islamic teachings. It also highlights the personal connection believers have with Allah and His teachings, which aligns with the concern about grasping the transformative relationship with God. However, while the response touches on the idea of internalized laws, it does not explicitly explore the transition from Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant as specified in the concern. To further strengthen the connection, the response could have more explicitly linked the Islamic concept to the Christian narrative, highlighting parallels between the two and emphasizing how they both point to a deeper relationship with God."
