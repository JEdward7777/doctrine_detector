  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of how Allah's laws being written on the hearts of believers in Islam signifies a transformative relationship with God. The connection between internalizing God's laws and fostering a personal knowledge of Him is well-articulated. However, the concern about transitioning from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant, specific to the Christian worldview, was not directly addressed in the response. A stronger tie-in or acknowledgment of this concern would have enhanced the overall grade."
