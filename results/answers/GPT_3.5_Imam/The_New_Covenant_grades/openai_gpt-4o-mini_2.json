  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a well-explained perspective on how Allah's guidance is internalized by believers in Islam, fostering a personal connection with Him. However, the concern of grasping the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant was not addressed, as the response focused solely on Islamic beliefs without integrating the Christian-specific worldview. Integrating a comparison or explanation of how the concept discussed differs or aligns with Christian beliefs would have improved the grade."
