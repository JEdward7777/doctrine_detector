  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student did not accurately address the Christian perspective on believers being glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. Their response focused more on Islamic beliefs and did not reflect a Christian worldview, missing the key aspect of believers being transformed to be like Jesus and sharing in His eternal glory. It is important to stay true to the specific worldview when addressing theological concepts."
