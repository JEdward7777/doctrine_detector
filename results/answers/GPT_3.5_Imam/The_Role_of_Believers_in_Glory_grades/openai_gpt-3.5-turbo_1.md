In the Islamic context, believers being glorified with Christ likely refers to the concept of righteousness and elevation in the sight of God. As Muslims, we believe in the importance of living a righteous life according to the teachings of Islam in order to attain the pleasure and favor of Allah.

In the New Testament, being glorified with Christ is often understood as believers sharing in the glory and honor of Christ in the afterlife. This concept is rooted in the belief that those who have faith in Christ and follow his teachings will be rewarded with eternal life in the presence of God.

As Muslims, we believe in the Day of Judgment when all individuals will be held accountable for their actions and intentions. Those who have lived according to the teachings of Islam and have faith in Allah will be rewarded with paradise, where they will experience a state of ultimate bliss and enjoyment.

Ultimately, whether in the Christian or Islamic context, the concept of being glorified with Christ or with Allah emphasizes the importance of faith, obedience, and righteousness in securing a positive outcome in the afterlife.
