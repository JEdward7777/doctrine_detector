However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to clarify that praising God and blessing others are distinct concepts. In Christianity, blessing is understood as invoking God's favor and protection upon someone, rather than simply praising or honoring them. It would have been beneficial for the student to address the biblical perspective on blessing in relation to praising God."
