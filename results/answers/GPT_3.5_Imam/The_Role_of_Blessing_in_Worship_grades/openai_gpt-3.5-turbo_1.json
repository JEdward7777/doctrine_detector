  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of how blessings are expressed in Islam, particularly in relation to praising and honoring God and the Prophet Muhammad. However, it does not directly address the relationship between blessings and worship in a Christian context as specified in the concern. To improve the grade, the response could have included comparisons or contrasts between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on blessings and worship."
