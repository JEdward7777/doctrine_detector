In Islam, we believe in the concept of seeking forgiveness and repentance from Allah for our sins. The Quran teaches us that sincere repentance can cleanse us from our sins and restore our spiritual purity.

In Christianity, the concept of cleansing in the Bible is often seen as symbolic of the forgiveness of sins through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The New Testament teaches that through faith in Jesus and his sacrifice on the cross, believers can be cleansed of their sins and reconciled with God.

Muslims seek cleansing and purification through sincere repentance and seeking forgiveness from Allah, while Christians believe in the cleansing of sins through faith in Jesus's sacrifice.
