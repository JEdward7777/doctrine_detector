However, it fails to delve into the Christian concept of cleansing in sufficient depth. The key theological point of Jesus Christ's sacrifice as the means of cleansing sins and providing redemption is mentioned but lacks substantial elaboration. The comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on cleansing could be more thorough and specific to doctrinal teachings. More references to key Biblical passages and principles related to sin, redemption, and forgiveness would improve the grade."
