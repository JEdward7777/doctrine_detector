The student briefly touches on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice for cleansing in Christianity, but does not fully connect it to the broader theme of redemption in the New Testament. More emphasis on the unique Christian perspective on sin and redemption, compared to the Islamic perspective, would have strengthened the answer."
