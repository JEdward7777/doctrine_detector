  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response inaccurately presents an Islamic perspective on figures like Moses and King David. The answer discusses God's selection process from an Islamic viewpoint rather than a Christian one. It is important to ensure the theological accuracy of the content provided, especially when discussing beliefs from different religious traditions. The response doesn't align with a Christian worldview, which affects the overall doctrinal correctness of the answer."
