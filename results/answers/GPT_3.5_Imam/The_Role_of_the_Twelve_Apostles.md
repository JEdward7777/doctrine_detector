## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic tradition, we believe in Jesus (peace be upon him) as a prophet and messenger of Allah, and we also acknowledge his disciples, though the specifics about the twelve apostles are not detailed in the Quran as they are in the Christian tradition. However, based on Islamic teachings and some shared beliefs with Christianity, the disciples of Jesus, including the twelve apostles, were significant because they were chosen by him to spread his message and teachings after he was raised to the heavens.

The disciples played a crucial role in carrying on the mission of Jesus and conveying his teachings to others. They were witnesses to his miracles and his message, and they continued to spread the message of monotheism and righteousness after his departure.

Their significance lies in their dedication to the teachings of Jesus, their steadfastness in the face of challenges and persecution, and their role in spreading the message of monotheism and righteousness. The disciples were instrumental in the early spread of Christianity and in preserving the teachings of Jesus for future generations.

In summary, the twelve apostles were significant among Jesus' disciples because they were chosen by him to continue his mission, spread his teachings, and establish the early Christian community.
