  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written answer that acknowledges the significance of the apostles in spreading Jesus' message, although the response primarily focuses on Islamic beliefs rather than the Christian perspective. While the student draws parallels between Islamic and Christian traditions, the Christian specific worldview emphasizes the apostles' role as chosen followers of Jesus for continuing His teachings, which was not directly addressed in the student's response. However, the student's understanding of the disciples' importance in conveying Jesus' message is evident."
