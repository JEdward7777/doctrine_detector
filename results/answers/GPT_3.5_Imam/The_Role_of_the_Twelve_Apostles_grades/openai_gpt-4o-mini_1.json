The connection between the apostles being chosen by Jesus and their task of continuing His teachings is well-explained. However, the Islamic perspective is also included, which may slightly detract from a solely Christian viewpoint. Nonetheless, the response effectively recognizes the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry."
