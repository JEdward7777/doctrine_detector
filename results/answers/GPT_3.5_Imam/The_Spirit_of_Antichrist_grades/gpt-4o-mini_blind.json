However, the focus should have been more on the Christian perspective on the spirit of antichrist as per the Bible, rather than delving extensively into Islamic beliefs. It is important to prioritize addressing the question from a Christian worldview when discussing biblical concepts. Additionally, some Christian doctrines related to the Antichrist could have been included to enhance the exegesis."
