However, while it acknowledges the importance of discerning true teachings from false ones, it does not emphasize the specific Christian belief in recognizing the spirit of antichrist to stay vigilant against deception, which is the specified concern. A higher grade could be achieved by directly addressing the importance of Christians identifying and resisting the spirit of antichrist as a critical part of their faith."
