Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible to refer to God as 'Almighty' and explained their significance in emphasizing God's power and sovereignty. However, the student missed the specific title 'Almighty God' and did not specifically state the term 'Lord God Almighty'. Encouraging the student to pay closer attention to all the details in the question and reference answer will help improve the accuracy and completeness of their responses in the future.
