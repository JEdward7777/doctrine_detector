The Islamic perspective presented is not relevant to the Christian worldview, which is the lens through which we are analyzing this topic. Additionally, there are historical inaccuracies in attributing the construction of the tabernacle and temple to different prophets. The student should focus on providing a response that aligns with Christian beliefs and accurately reflects the biblical account."
