## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle because it served as a temporary place of worship until the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. According to Islamic belief, the tabernacle was a place of worship built by Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) as commanded by Allah. The Tabernacle was used for centuries by the Israelites until the Temple was built by Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him). After the construction of the Temple, the tabernacle was no longer needed for worship purposes.
