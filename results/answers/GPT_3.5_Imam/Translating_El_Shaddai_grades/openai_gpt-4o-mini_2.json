The initial answer also suggests keeping the term as 'God Almighty' or 'Shaddai' when no existing translation is available, which demonstrates sensitivity to accurately representing God's name across different cultures and languages. This aligns well with the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name. The only suggestion for improvement could be to include a brief mention of the significance or biblical background of the term 'El Shaddai' in the response."
