They effectively highlighted the importance of preserving the original nuances and symbolism of these terms for conveying the intended message and maintaining the spiritual and cultural heritage of the scripture. However, the response could have been strengthened by focusing more specifically on the Christian perspective and the connection to Biblical teachings."
