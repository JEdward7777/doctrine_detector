  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: While the response provides a comprehensive exploration of the concept of \"image of God\" in Islamic theology and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus, it falls short of addressing the topic from a Christian worldview as requested. The student accurately presents Islamic perspectives but fails to adequately discuss Christian translations for the phrase. Additionally, the response does not delve deeply into the significance of these translations within a Christian context. Greater focus on explaining the Christian understanding of humans and Jesus as the image of God would have strengthened the response."
