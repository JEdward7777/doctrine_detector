  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on the concept of humans being created in the image of God and Jesus in relation to Islamic beliefs. However, the student did not engage with the specific translations suggested in the question and did not address the significance of these translations in understanding biblical teachings. Furthermore, the student did not provide alternative translations based on a Christian specific worldview. While the student demonstrated knowledge and understanding, the lack of direct engagement with the question's focus on suggested translations for the phrase 'image of God' for humans and Jesus within a Christian context is why the grade is lower."
