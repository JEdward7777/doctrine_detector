  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on the concept of humans being created in the image of God, as well as the unique status of Jesus in both faith traditions. The student effectively addresses the concern by discussing the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. However, points are deducted for not clearly articulating a Christian-specific worldview throughout the response. Additionally, the student could have highlighted more explicitly the theological significance of Jesus as the exact likeness of God in the Christian faith compared to the Islamic perspective on his prophethood."
