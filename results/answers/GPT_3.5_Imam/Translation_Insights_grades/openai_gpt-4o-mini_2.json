It effectively addresses the concern about the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings by discussing alternative translations in both Christian and Islamic contexts. The response maintains respect for both faith traditions while highlighting theological differences. However, it could have further emphasized the uniqueness of Jesus as the Son of God in the Christian faith and perhaps elaborated more on the significance of Jesus as the exact likeness of God."
