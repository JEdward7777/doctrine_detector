  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed and respectful answer that acknowledges the sacredness of referring to God in both Islam and Judaism. They appropriately tied in the reverence for God's name in Judaism to the use of 'LORD' in Bible translations. However, the student's response lacks specific mention of the historical fear of mispronouncing 'Yahweh' as highlighted in the reference answer. It would strengthen their response to include this detail to align more closely with the Christian worldview concerning the use of 'LORD' in translations."
