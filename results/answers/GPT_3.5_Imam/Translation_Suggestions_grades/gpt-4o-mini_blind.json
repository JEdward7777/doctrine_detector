  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student did a good job exploring the Islamic perspective on zeal and provided alternative translations in line with Islamic teachings, the answer deviated significantly from the Christian context which was the focus of the question. The response should have emphasized alternative translations from a Christian perspective to reflect the biblical meaning of being zealous. Additionally, the answer could have expanded on how being zealous is portrayed in the Bible and its significance in Christian faith and practice. In the context of evaluating the answer against a Christian specific worldview, the student's response did not align with the doctrinal correctness expected."
