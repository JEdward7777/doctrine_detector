  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out answer and offered insightful alternative translations from an Islamic perspective that emphasize dedication and commitment to faith. However, the concern specifically highlighted the Christian context, so the response did not align fully with the given concern. Additionally, the translations provided did not closely reflect the reference answer provided by the teacher, which focused more on diligence and effort. The student's explanation was detailed and relevant but lacked alignment with the Christian worldview context."
