  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of \"zealousness\" within both Islamic and Christian contexts. They effectively draw parallels between the Islamic concepts of \"passion for righteousness\" and \"fervor in devotion\" and the Christian concept of \"zealousness.\" The student also provides several insightful alternative translations that reflect the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific connection between the Islamic and Christian concepts of zeal. Additionally, the answer does not directly address the student's concern about understanding different translations in relation to the Christian worldview."
