  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided alternative translations from an Islamic perspective which focused on trustworthiness and loyalty, the translations provided did not align closely with the Christian-specific concept of 'covenant faithfulness.' In a Christian worldview, 'covenant faithfulness' carries a deeper connotation of unwavering love, commitment, and dependability within the context of God's covenant with His people. The student's response could have been improved by incorporating translations that more closely reflected the Christian understanding of this term."
