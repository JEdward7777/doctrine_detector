Comment: The response provides alternative translations from an Islamic perspective, which expands the understanding of covenant faithfulness beyond the Christian context. While these translations align with core values in Islam, they do not directly address the concern of exploring interpretations within the Christian biblical framework. The response lacks a connection to the specific concern provided.
