  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 75.\n\nThe answer provides a clear explanation of how the translation of \"Lord\" differs in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people within the Islamic perspective. The student effectively contrasts the meaning of \"Rabb\" when used in relation to God as the Creator, Sustainer, and Master, with its usage for ordinary individuals denoting authority and control. \n\nTo enhance the response, the student could have further elaborated on the Christian perspective on the term \"Lord,\" emphasizing the unique theological significance attached to it within Christianity, such as acknowledging Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Additionally, discussing the biblical basis of the term \"Lord\" in Christianity would have added depth to the answer.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic but could benefit from incorporating insights from a Christian worldview to enrich the comparison."
