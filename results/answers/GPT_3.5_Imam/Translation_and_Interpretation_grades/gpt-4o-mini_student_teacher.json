  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of how the term \"Lord\" is understood in Islamic context both in reference to God and ordinary people. However, the student does not specifically address the Christian perspective or the biblical usage of the term. Additionally, the student's answer lacks specificity in discussing the translation differences between contexts referring to God versus ordinary people, which is crucial for understanding the impact on the nature of God as revealed in scripture."
