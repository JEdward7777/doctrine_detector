  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the significance of the term \"Lord\" in the Islamic context and correctly identifies the capitalization of the term when referring to God. However, the response does not directly address the concern about the impact of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms on understanding scripture and the nature of God from a Christian worldview. The grade is slightly lowered due to this omission."
