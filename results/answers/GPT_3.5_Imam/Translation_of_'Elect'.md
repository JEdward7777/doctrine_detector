## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In older English Bible versions, such as the King James Version (KJV), the word "elect" is commonly used to refer to those chosen by God for salvation or a special purpose. In modern English Bible versions, however, the term "chosen" is often used instead of "elect" to convey the same meaning. 

The impact of this change in translation can affect how readers understand the concept of God's chosen people and the idea of being selected or set apart by God. The word "elect" can sometimes carry a sense of exclusivity or elitism, implying that only a select few are chosen by God. On the other hand, the word "chosen" may be more relatable and easier for modern readers to grasp, emphasizing the idea that God selects individuals or groups for a specific purpose without necessarily excluding others.

Overall, while the choice of translation for the term "elect" may impact how readers interpret and apply certain passages of Scripture, the core message of God's sovereignty in choosing and calling people to Himself remains consistent across different translations and versions of the Bible.
