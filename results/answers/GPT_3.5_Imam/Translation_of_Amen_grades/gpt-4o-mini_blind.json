  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 75. The student correctly identifies potential translations of \"truly\" as used by Jesus, such as \"verily,\" \"indeed,\" \"truly,\" \"surely,\" and \"of a truth.\" However, the answer could be improved by including a biblical reference or two where Jesus uses this phrase to provide more context and support for the translations given. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of the term \"truly\" in conveying the certainty and seriousness of Jesus' words would enhance the explanation. Overall, a solid answer but with room for further depth and development."
