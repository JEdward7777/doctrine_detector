  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation, which aligns with the concern specified. It also attempts to provide some potential translations for the term \"truly\" in its original context.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific biblical examples or explanations of how Jesus' use of \"truly\" emphasizes his message. The offered alternative translations, while accurate, are somewhat generic and do not fully capture the solemnity and emphasis conveyed by Jesus' original phrases.\n\nA more detailed analysis of Jesus' usage of \"truly\" in various Gospel narratives could have strengthened the response and demonstrated a deeper understanding of the term's significance in biblical translation and interpretation."
