However, to fully address the concern of accurate biblical translation and interpretation, it would have been beneficial to delve deeper into the theological nuances and implications of Jesus' use of this term in the specific cultural and historical context of the biblical narratives. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of language in conveying Biblical truths."
