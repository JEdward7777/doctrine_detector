  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant information about the term \"ark\" in both Islamic and Biblical contexts, highlighting the significance of the ark in the stories of Prophet Nuh and Prophet Musa. However, the focus on the Ark of the Covenant in the Biblical context was not directly related to the varying translations of the term \"ark\" within different contexts as per the concern. Additionally, the student missed discussing the different sizes and meanings associated with the term \"ark\" as outlined in the reference answer. The response showed an understanding of the importance of the ark symbolically, but lacked a detailed analysis of the translational variations and contextual meanings."
