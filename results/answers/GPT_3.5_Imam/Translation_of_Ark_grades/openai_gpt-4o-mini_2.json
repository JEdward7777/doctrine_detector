  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"ark\" in both Islamic and Christian contexts, highlighting its significance and variations in translation. The connection between Prophet Nuh's ark, the Ark of the Covenant, and other biblical references is well articulated. However, there could have been a bit more focus on accurately addressing the concern of ensuring proper interpretation of scripture through translations and contextual understanding. Overall, a strong response with insightful comparisons and explanations."
