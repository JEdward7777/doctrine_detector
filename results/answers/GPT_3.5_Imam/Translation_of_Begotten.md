## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In a spiritual sense, the term 'begotten' can be understood in relation to spiritual rebirth as a metaphor for the transformative process of being born again or brought into a new spiritual life through faith and submission to the will of Allah.

In Islamic belief, the idea of being spiritually reborn is often associated with the concept of Tawbah (repentance) and the idea of turning back to Allah with sincerity and seeking forgiveness for one's sins. This process of repentance and seeking forgiveness can be seen as a metaphorical rebirth where one leaves behind their old ways and is "begotten" into a new life of devotion, righteousness, and closeness to Allah.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of repentance and seeking forgiveness, as it allows individuals to purify their hearts and souls, and to renew their commitment to following the path of righteousness. This spiritual rebirth through repentance and seeking forgiveness can lead to a deep sense of spiritual renewal, peace, and closeness to Allah.

Therefore, in the context of spiritual rebirth, the term 'begotten' can be understood as a symbolic expression of the transformative process of turning back to Allah, seeking forgiveness, and being spiritually reborn into a new life of faith and devotion.
