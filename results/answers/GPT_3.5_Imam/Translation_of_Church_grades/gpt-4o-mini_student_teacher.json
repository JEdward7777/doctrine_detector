The term 'church' in Christian context signifies a gathering or assembly of believers, not just a place of worship. The suggested translations provided by the student focus solely on the physical location or activities within a church, rather than emphasizing the collective body of believers. In a Christian worldview, it is important to convey the concept of gathering together as a community of believers in the translations of the term 'church'."
