- **Ibadah House**: This term translates to 'house of worship' in English and can be used to refer to a church, as it is a place where worship and prayers take place.

Grade: 25

Comment: The student's response does not accurately reflect the concern of representing the inclusive nature of the church in translations. The term 'church' in Christian context signifies a gathering or assembly of believers, not just a place of worship. The suggested translations provided by the student focus solely on the physical location or activities within a church, rather than emphasizing the collective body of believers. In a Christian worldview, it is important to convey the concept of gathering together as a community of believers in the translations of the term 'church'.
