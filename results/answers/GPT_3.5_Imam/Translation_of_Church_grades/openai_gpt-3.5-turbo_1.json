While the translations provided emphasize the worship aspect, they do not fully address the concern of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature in translations. The suggested translations do not explicitly convey the idea of the church as a gathering of all believers, as mentioned in the given answer. Therefore, there is room for improvement in aligning the translations with the concern raised."
