The translations suggested do capture the concept of gathering believers together, but could have more explicitly emphasized the inclusivity of the church by using terms like 'gathering of all believers' or 'assembly of the faithful'. Adding such language would have further highlighted the church's inclusive nature as expressed in the concern provided."
