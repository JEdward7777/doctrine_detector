- **Masjid**: This term is commonly used in Arabic and is often translated as 'mosque' in English. However, 'masjid' can also be used to refer to a place of worship for Christians.
  
- **Ibadah House**: This term translates to 'house of worship' in English and can be used to refer to a church, as it is a place where worship and prayers take place.

- **Bayt Al-Ibadah**: This can be translated as 'house of worship' or 'place of worship.' It signifies a place dedicated to the worship of God.

- **Makan Salat Al-Masihiyin**: This Arabic term can be translated as 'place of Christian prayers,' emphasizing the significance of prayer and worship in a church.

Each of these translations aims to capture the essence and purpose of a church as a place of worship and congregation for Christians.
