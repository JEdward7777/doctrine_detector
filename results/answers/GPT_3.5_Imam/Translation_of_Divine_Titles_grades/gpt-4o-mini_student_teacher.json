  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided translations in various languages that aim to convey the concept of God's lordship and authority, which aligns with the concern of maintaining the meaning of God's titles in Scripture. However, the reference answer emphasizes the importance of considering grammatical structure in the target language, which the student did not address explicitly. Additionally, the student focused more on explaining the Islamic perspective rather than providing a nuanced Christian perspective, which could have enriched the response further."
