In Islamic perspective, the term "Lord Yahweh" refers to Allah, the one true God. While "Yahweh" is a term used in Judaism and Christianity, Muslims believe in the same God but refer to Him as Allah. 

To maintain the meaning of "Lord Yahweh" in different languages, it can be translated as follows:

1. Arabic: رب الله (Rabb Allah)
2. Urdu: خدا کا رب (Khuda ka Rabb)
3. Turkish: Tanrı’nın Rab (Tanrı’nın Rab)
4. Spanish: Señor Dios (Lord God)
