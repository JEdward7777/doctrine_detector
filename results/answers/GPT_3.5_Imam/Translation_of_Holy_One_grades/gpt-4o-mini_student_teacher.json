  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided translations of the term \"Holy One\" in various languages, particularly within an Islamic context. However, the concern here is ensuring accurate representation of the term to maintain theological implications. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes retaining the meaning of holiness, often implying 'God' or 'the Set Apart One.' The student's answer does not fully address this concern as it focuses more on linguistic translations rather than capturing the theological depth and implications associated with the term \"Holy One.\" Therefore, the grade is lower as it lacks theological precision in translation."
