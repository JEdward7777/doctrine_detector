However, the answer does not specifically address the concern regarding Christians needing clarity on the emotional weight of lamentation in integrating it into their spiritual practices. It would have been stronger if the response directly linked the significance of understanding the emotional weight of lamentation in the Christian context for spiritual growth and reflection."
