  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides some general information about Islamic theology's concept of \"predestined\" as \"qadar\" or \"qadaa\", which shows an attempt to provide context for understanding predestination. However, it does not directly address the concern of ensuring accurate understanding of biblical translations related to predestination. The provided translations (\"decided long ago\", \"planned ahead of time\", or \"decided beforehand\") are also somewhat vague and do not specifically relate to biblical concepts of predestination. A higher grade would be given if the response more explicitly linked Islamic theological concepts to biblical understandings of predestination, while still maintaining accuracy and relevance."
