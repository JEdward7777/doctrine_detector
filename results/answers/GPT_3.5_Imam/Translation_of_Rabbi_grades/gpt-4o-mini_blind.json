The examples given for equivalent terms in Arabic, Urdu, and English demonstrate good cultural awareness. However, the response could have been strengthened by including a brief acknowledgment of the theological and spiritual significance of the term 'Rabbi' in its original context within Judaism. Connecting the role of a Rabbi to the broader religious and theological framework of Judaism would have further enriched the answer."
