  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith by emphasizing the importance of respecting the title 'Rabbi' and not implying that Jesus was merely a schoolteacher. It also appropriately considers the significance of the term 'Rabbi' in Judaism while discussing the translation into different languages. The only minor improvement could be to further elaborate on how the translation should align with the Christian understanding of Jesus as a divine teacher, beyond just ensuring respect for the title."
