It correctly emphasizes the importance of maintaining the significance of the title without diminishing Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith. The examples provided demonstrate an understanding of cultural and linguistic considerations in translation. However, there could have been more explicit references to Jesus' unique role as the ultimate teacher in Christianity to further strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
