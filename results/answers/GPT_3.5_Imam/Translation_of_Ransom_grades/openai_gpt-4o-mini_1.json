The inclusion of various translations enhances the clarity of the explanation within different cultural contexts. The response could be further strengthened by connecting this understanding of ransom to the Christian theological concept of Christ's sacrifice as a ransom for humanity, showcasing the significance of redemption through payment in Christian belief."
