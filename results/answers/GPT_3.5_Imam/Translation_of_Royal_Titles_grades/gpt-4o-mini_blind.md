Comment: The answer effectively provides translations for 'Your Majesty' in Arabic, Urdu, and Turkish, demonstrating an understanding of linguistic diversity. However, there is a missed opportunity to highlight the significance of addressing authority figures with respect and honor, which is important from a Christian worldview that values obedience and humility in interactions with those in positions of authority. Incorporating a brief note on the biblical principles of honoring authority figures would have enhanced the answer.
