Comment: The student provided translations in Arabic, Urdu, and Turkish for 'Your Majesty,' but did not align with the reference answer's suggestion of using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency.' While considering cultural nuances is important, the focus should be on accuracy and respect in the context of biblical teachings. The student's answer lacked specificity in this regard.
