In Arabic, the phrase 'Your Majesty' can be translated as "جلالتك" (jalaalatk). In Urdu, it can be translated as "جلالت" (jalaalat). In Turkish, it can be translated as "Hazretleri". Each language may have its own specific cultural nuances and traditions when it comes to addressing royalty or people of high authority, so it's important to consider the appropriate translation that aligns with the cultural context.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response as 60.

While the response provides some accurate information about translations of "Your Majesty" in different languages, it falls short in addressing the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings. The original answer is more vague and general, not specifically addressing the biblical context.

The provided response does provide some specific examples of translations, but it could be improved by considering how these translations align with biblical teachings on respect for authority and cultural nuances. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more nuanced discussion on the importance of understanding cultural contexts when translating titles in a biblical setting.

To improve this response, I would suggest adding more specific examples of translations that are relevant to biblical teachings, as well as discussing how cultural context should be considered when translating titles in a biblical setting.
