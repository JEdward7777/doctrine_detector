Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of accurately and respectfully translating titles, which aligns with the concern of ensuring biblical teachings are upheld in translations. However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the specific translations provided in Arabic, Urdu, and Turkish. Expanding on how the biblical teachings may influence the choice of translation for "Your Majesty" in these languages would strengthen the response.
