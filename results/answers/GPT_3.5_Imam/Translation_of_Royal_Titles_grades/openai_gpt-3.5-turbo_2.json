However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to consider biblical teachings that emphasize respect for authority figures. While cultural differences are acknowledged, there should also be a focus on ensuring that translations align with biblical principles of respect and honor towards rulers and authority figures. This aspect could have been further developed in the response to better address the concern raised."
