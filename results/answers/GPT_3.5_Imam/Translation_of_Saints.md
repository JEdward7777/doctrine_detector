## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic terminology, the term "saints" does not have a direct equivalent. However, in Islamic tradition, we have the concept of "Awliya Allah" which can be loosely translated as "the friends of Allah" or "saints". These are individuals who have a close and special relationship with Allah due to their piety, righteousness, and closeness to Him.

So, a recommended way to translate the term "saints" in an Islamic context would be "Awliya Allah" or "the friends of Allah".
