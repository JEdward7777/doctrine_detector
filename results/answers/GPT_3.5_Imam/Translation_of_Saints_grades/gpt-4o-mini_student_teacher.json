However, the answer did not directly address the concern of using inclusive language for all believers in Jesus without reference to specific Christian groups. In a Christian perspective, the term \"saints\" typically refers to all believers rather than a specific select group, so the translation provided did not align with the given concern. Additionally, the reference answer offers more suitable translations in line with the requirement of inclusive language for all believers in Jesus."
