While the suggested translation aligns with Islamic terminology, it does not fully address the concern of using inclusive language for all believers in Jesus within a Christian-specific worldview. There could have been an opportunity to highlight a more suitable translation that encompasses all believers in Jesus without specifying particular Christian groups."
