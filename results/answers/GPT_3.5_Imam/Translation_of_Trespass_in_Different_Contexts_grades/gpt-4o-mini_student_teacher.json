  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed response that touched on the implications of translating \"trespass\" as \"sin\" or \"breaking the rule\" within a church community. However, the student's answer focused more on Islamic teachings and perspectives rather than addressing the Christian-specific worldview as requested. While the response was thoughtful and insightful, it did not fully align with the concern provided, which was centered on ensuring church teachings align with scriptural integrity and community values. The student would have received a higher grade by incorporating more explicitly Christian perspectives and principles into their analysis."
