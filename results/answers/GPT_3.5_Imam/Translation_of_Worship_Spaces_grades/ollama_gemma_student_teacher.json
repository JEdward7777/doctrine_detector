  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the concern for accurate translations in a contemporary context. However, it lacks specific reference to the Christian understanding of the 'house of Yahweh' and its significance. The translation suggestions provided are more appropriate for Islamic contexts and do not fully capture the unique nature of a 'house of Yahweh' in Christian theology."
