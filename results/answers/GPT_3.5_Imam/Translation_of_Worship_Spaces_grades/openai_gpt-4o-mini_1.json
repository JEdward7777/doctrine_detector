It failed to address the concern of accurately translating the concept of worship spaces within a Christian context. Additionally, the answer did not emphasize the significance of Yahweh's presence in the 'house of Yahweh', which is crucial in understanding the importance of the worship space in Christianity. More focus on conveying the unique Christian perspective on worship spaces would have been beneficial."
