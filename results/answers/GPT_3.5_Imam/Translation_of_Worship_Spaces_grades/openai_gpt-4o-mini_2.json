The response does offer an alternative interpretation by equating 'house of Yahweh' to 'the house of God' or 'mosque', but it lacks depth in connecting this interpretation to the significance of worship spaces and the presence of God. There is a need for a stronger emphasis on the theological implications and reverence associated with the term 'house of Yahweh' in the Christian worldview when discussing worship spaces."
