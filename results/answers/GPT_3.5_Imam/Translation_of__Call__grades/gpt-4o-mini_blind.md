In a Muslim context, the phrase "You must call his name" can be translated as "You should mention his name" or "You are commanded to invoke his name." This can refer to calling upon the name of a prophet or a figure of significance in Islam, such as Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) or one of the names of Allah. It is often seen as an act of remembrance, reverence, and seeking blessings.

40.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would give this response a grade of 40. While the student attempts to provide alternative translations in a non-Christian context, the question specifically asks for translations in a biblical context. The student could have provided alternative translations for the phrase "You must call his name" in a Christian context, such as "You are to proclaim his name" or "You are urged to invoke his name." The response also lacks specific references to biblical figures or teachings, which are essential when discussing translations in a Christian context. Overall, the answer misses the mark in addressing the question through a Christian worldview.
