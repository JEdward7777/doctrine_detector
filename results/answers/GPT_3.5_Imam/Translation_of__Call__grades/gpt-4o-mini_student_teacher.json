  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 50/100.\n\nWhile the student provides an insightful perspective on the phrase in a Muslim context and offers alternative translations that demonstrate an understanding of calling upon the names of figures in Islam, their response does not directly address the concern of understanding the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation. The reference answer focuses on the act of assigning a name, which is more closely tied to the original biblical context. The student's answer, while informative, strays from the specific Christian worldview perspective required for this question."
