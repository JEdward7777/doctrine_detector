  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 70.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge the potential nuance of the phrase \"You must call his name\" in a Muslim context, it primarily focuses on the act of assigning a name rather than exploring the biblical implications. The concern emphasized was understanding the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation, but the response did not demonstrate a deep engagement with this concern.\n\nThe comment I would provide is: \"This response shows some insight into the possible meanings of the phrase in a Muslim context, but could have delved deeper into how these nuances might be relevant to interpreting biblical language. A higher grade would require more explicit connections between the Muslim interpretation and the broader concern about understanding biblical language.\""
