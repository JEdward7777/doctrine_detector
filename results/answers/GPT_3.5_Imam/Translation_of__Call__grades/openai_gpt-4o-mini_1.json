  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response correctly highlights the alternative translation of \"you must name him\" which emphasizes the action of assigning a name. However, the concern of understanding biblical language and its impact on interpretation is not directly addressed in the response, which lowers the grade. To improve, the response could have elaborated on how understanding biblical language nuances can shape interpretations in a Christian worldview context."
