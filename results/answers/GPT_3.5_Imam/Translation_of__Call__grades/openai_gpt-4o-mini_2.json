However, the concern raised regarding understanding biblical language and its impact on interpretation is not fully addressed. While the response explains the translation in a Muslim context, it does not directly engage with the nuances of biblical language or offer comparisons with Christian interpretations. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into how biblical language nuances can shape interpretations within a Christian worldview."
