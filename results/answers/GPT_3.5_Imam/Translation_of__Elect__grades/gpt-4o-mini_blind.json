  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a fairly accurate explanation of the difference in translation of 'elect' between older and modern English Bible versions. They also pointed out the potential impact on understanding Scripture due to this change. However, it would have been helpful for the student to delve deeper into the theological implications of the word choice and how it may shape our understanding of God's sovereignty and the doctrine of election. Additionally, a more explicit connection to theological principles and implications in relation to the translation differences would have enhanced the answer."
