  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned and well-supported answer from a Christian perspective, discussing the reverence and respect towards God's name as well as the emphasis on His sovereignty and authority. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices. The answer could have been improved by acknowledging the tension between maintaining the original name \"Yahweh\" and the cultural practice of using \"LORD\" in translations. Overall, a strong answer but lacking in addressing the specific concern raised."
