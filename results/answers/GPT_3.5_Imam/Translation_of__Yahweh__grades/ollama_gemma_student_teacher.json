  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theological and cultural considerations behind the use of \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in translations. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the reverence and respect associated with the name of God, while also acknowledging the practical considerations of accessibility and translation practices. The student's reference to the Jewish tradition of not pronouncing the sacred name and the inclusion of the belief that \"LORD\" emphasizes God's sovereignty are insightful additions that enhance the overall quality of the response."
