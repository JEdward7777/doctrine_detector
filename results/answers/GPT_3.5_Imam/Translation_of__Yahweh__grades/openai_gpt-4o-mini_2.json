It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the balance between adhering to the original Hebrew text and making it accessible to congregations while maintaining traditional practices. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of using the original names of God in scripture compared to cultural practices, to provide a more comprehensive viewpoint."
