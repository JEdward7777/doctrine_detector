The terms \"\u062d\u0628\u064a\u0628\" (Habib) and \"\u0645\u062d\u0628\u0648\u0628\" (Mahboub) are indeed commonly used in Arabic to convey the sense of love and affection. The answer is doctrinally sound and reflects a good understanding of the linguistic nuances involved in translation. Great job!"
