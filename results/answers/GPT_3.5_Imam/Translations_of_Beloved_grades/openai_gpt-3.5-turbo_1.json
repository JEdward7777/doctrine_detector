The inclusion of the term \"\u062d\u0628\u064a\u0628\" (Habib) and \"\u0645\u062d\u0628\u0648\u0628\" (Mahboub) in Arabic, which are commonly used in literary contexts to express love and affection, demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural nuances necessary for biblical interpretation. However, further exploration and explanation of the significance of these terms within a Christian specific worldview could enhance the response even more."
