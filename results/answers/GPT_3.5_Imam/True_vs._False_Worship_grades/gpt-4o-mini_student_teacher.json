  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of worship in Islam, focusing on monotheism and the prohibition of worshiping false gods. However, the response did not address the Christian perspective on worshiping God versus false gods, as specifically outlined in the reference answer. The student needs to make connections to the Christian worldview and understanding of worship to fully address the given concern."
