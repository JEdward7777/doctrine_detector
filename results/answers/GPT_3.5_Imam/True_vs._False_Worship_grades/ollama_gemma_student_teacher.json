  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer accurately defines the difference between worshipping God and worshipping false gods in Islam. It clearly explains that Islamic worship involves submission to Allah's will and acknowledging His Oneness, while worshiping false gods involves ascribing partners to Allah or worshiping other deities. The inclusion of references to Quran and Islamic teachings strengthens the response. However, the answer could benefit from expanding on the concept of true worship in Christianity, as requested in the concern."
