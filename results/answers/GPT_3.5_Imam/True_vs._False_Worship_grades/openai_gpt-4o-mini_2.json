While the response did not directly address the concern from a Christian-specific viewpoint, it effectively highlighted the significance of directing honor and service to the true God. The connection between the Islamic perspective on worshiping Allah alone and the Christian concern could have been elaborated further to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
