## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, there are certain criteria that can help us distinguish between a true prophet of God and a false prophet. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Prophets in Islam are known to be individuals of impeccable character, honesty, and integrity. They are chosen by Allah for their piety and righteousness. A true prophet will exhibit these traits consistently in their actions and words.

2. A true prophet will always call people to worship and obey Allah alone, without associating any partners with Him. They will emphasize the oneness of God and the importance of following His commandments.

3. Prophets in Islam come with miracles and signs to prove their authenticity. These miracles are a clear demonstration of their connection to Allah and serve as evidence of their prophethood.

4. The teachings and message of a true prophet will be in line with the teachings of previous prophets and the Quran. Islam emphasizes the consistency and continuity of the message of all the prophets throughout history.

5. False prophets may display signs of greed, dishonesty, or immorality. Their teachings may contradict the core principles of Islam, such as the oneness of God, righteousness, and compassion.

6. It is important to seek knowledge and guidance from reputable scholars and sources to understand the true teachings of Islam and differentiate between true and false prophets.

Ultimately, it is essential to turn to Allah for guidance and to pray for clarity and discernment in recognizing the truth. May Allah protect us from false prophets and guide us on the straight path.
