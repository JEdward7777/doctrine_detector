  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a comprehensive list of criteria specifically relevant to Islam.\n* Offers clear explanations of each criterion, demonstrating understanding of Islamic beliefs.\n* Includes examples of false prophets in Islam to illustrate the points made.\n* Emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance from reputable scholars and the Quran for discerning truth.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Does not directly address the concern of discerning true prophetic voices from those that mislead or misrepresent God's messages.\n* Does not elaborate on examining the fruits of a prophet's ministry as a means of identification.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The response could be strengthened by addressing the specific concern of discerning true voices from false ones, perhaps mentioning the importance of examining the impact and results of a prophet's teachings on individuals and society.\n* Including more examples of both true and false prophets from Islamic history would enhance the comprehensiveness of the response.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a deep understanding of Islamic beliefs and the criteria for discerning true prophets. However, addressing the specific concern and elaborating on the examination of fruits would further elevate the quality of the answer."
