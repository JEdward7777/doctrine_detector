  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a detailed and specific explanation of how to distinguish true prophets from false ones in Islam, highlighting key characteristics such as impeccable character, emphasis on worshiping Allah alone, and miracles or signs to prove authenticity. It also mentions the importance of seeking knowledge and guidance from reputable sources and turning to Allah for guidance.\n\nWhile the response does not explicitly mention aligning messages with God's Word or examining the nature of teachings and fruits of a ministry (as mentioned in the given answer), it does provide a clear and concise framework for discerning true prophets from false ones. The concern about being able to discern true prophetic voices is also addressed, as the response emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance and turning to Allah.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are:\n\n* It does not explicitly mention examining messages against God's Word or nature of teachings and fruits of a ministry, which is an important aspect of discerning truth.\n* While it provides a detailed framework for distinguishing true prophets from false ones, it does not directly address the concern about being able to discern true prophetic voices.\n\nOverall, however, the response provides a thoughtful and comprehensive explanation of how to distinguish true prophets from false ones in Islam."
