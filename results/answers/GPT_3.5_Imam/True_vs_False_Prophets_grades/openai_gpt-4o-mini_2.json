The emphasis on seeking guidance from trustworthy sources and praying for discernment resonates with the importance of relying on God's wisdom in discerning prophetic voices. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a bit more explicit reference to Jesus Christ as the ultimate standard for discerning true prophets within a Christian framework. Overall, a solid response with a strong Christian worldview perspective."
