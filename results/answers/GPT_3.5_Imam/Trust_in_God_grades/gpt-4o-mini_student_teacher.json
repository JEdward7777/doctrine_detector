  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated explanation of the difference between having hope in God and merely wishing for something. They effectively highlight the importance of faith, trust, surrender, and reliance on God in true hope. However, the student's response could be improved by focusing more directly on the distinction between hope as a confident trust in God's promises versus wishful thinking. Additionally, the student effectively incorporates Christian principles and worldview in their response."
