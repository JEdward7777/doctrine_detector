  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided valuable insights into demonstrating trustworthiness according to Islamic principles. However, since the question specifically asked for a perspective based on Biblical principles, the response did not align closely with the Christian worldview. In grading from a Christian-specific worldview, the emphasis should be on Biblical teachings and references, which were lacking in this response. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological foundations of trustworthiness within Islam, drawing parallels or differences with Christian beliefs on the same topic."
