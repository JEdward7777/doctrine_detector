  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough and well-articulated answer from an Islamic perspective on demonstrating trustworthiness, the concern specifically asked for a response based on Biblical principles. The student did not directly address the concern related to encouraging followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability. The answer did not reference specific Biblical verses or teachings to support the points made. Therefore, the grade is lower due to the lack of direct alignment with the specified concern."
