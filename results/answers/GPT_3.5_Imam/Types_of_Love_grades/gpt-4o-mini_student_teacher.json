  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of love from an Islamic perspective, which is informative. However, the response did not directly address the concern of differentiating types of love while ensuring alignment with a biblical worldview. The student's answer focused solely on Islamic concepts of love rather than comparing and contrasting them with the biblical definition of love. The response could have been strengthened by integrating references to biblical verses or principles to demonstrate how brotherly love and romantic love align with the biblical definition of love."
