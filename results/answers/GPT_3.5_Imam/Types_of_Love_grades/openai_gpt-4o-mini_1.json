  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the different types of love in Islam, particularly focusing on brotherly love and romantic love within the context of marriage. The reference to Quranic verses and teachings demonstrates a strong understanding of Islamic perspectives on love. However, the response lacks direct comparison or integration with the biblical perspective on love as described in the given answer. If the response had included more explicit connections or contrasts between Islamic and Christian views on love, it would have received a higher grade. Nonetheless, the content is well articulated and aligns with Islamic principles of love."
