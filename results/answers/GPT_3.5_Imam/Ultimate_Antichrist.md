In Islamic eschatology, the figure often identified as the ultimate Antichrist is known as Al-Masih ad-Dajjal. Dajjal is described as a false messiah who will appear towards the end of times, spreading corruption and deception on earth. Muslims are warned to be wary of him, as he will possess great powers of deception and will lead many astray.
