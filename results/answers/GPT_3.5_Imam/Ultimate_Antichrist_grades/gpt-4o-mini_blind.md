## [Answer](../Ultimate_Antichrist.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic eschatology, the figure often identified as the ultimate Antichrist is known as Al-Masih ad-Dajjal. Dajjal is described as a false messiah who will appear towards the end of times, spreading corruption and deception on earth. Muslims are warned to be wary of him, as he will possess great powers of deception and will lead many astray. It is believed that before the Day of Judgment, Prophet Jesus (Isa) will return to defeat the Dajjal and establish justice on earth.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student accurately explains the Islamic perspective on the ultimate Antichrist, Al-Masih ad-Dajjal, as described in Islamic eschatology. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that the ultimate Antichrist in the book of Revelation is commonly identified as a figure aligned with evil, deception, and opposing Christ. In Christian doctrine, the Antichrist is seen as a significant end-time figure who will deceive many before being ultimately defeated by Jesus Christ during His return. The answer provided does not address the Christian perspective on the ultimate Antichrist, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of eschatology.
