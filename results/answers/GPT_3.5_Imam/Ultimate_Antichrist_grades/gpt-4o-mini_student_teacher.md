## [Answer](../Ultimate_Antichrist.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic eschatology, the figure often identified as the ultimate Antichrist is known as Al-Masih ad-Dajjal. Dajjal is described as a false messiah who will appear towards the end of times, spreading corruption and deception on earth. Muslims are warned to be wary of him, as he will possess great powers of deception and will lead many astray. It is believed that before the Day of Judgment, Prophet Jesus (Isa) will return to defeat the Dajjal and establish justice on earth.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided information about the figure identified as the ultimate Antichrist in Islamic eschatology, but failed to address the question in the context of the book of Revelation from a Christian worldview. The response did not demonstrate understanding of the Christian perspective on the Antichrist as described in Revelation. A higher grade could have been achieved by directly addressing the Christian view on the ultimate Antichrist outlined in the book of Revelation.
