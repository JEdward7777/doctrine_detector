  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the figure of the Antichrist in Islamic eschatology. They accurately identify Al-Masih ad-Dajjal as the Islamic equivalent and provide a concise description of his characteristics and role in eschatological beliefs. However, the answer lacks specific reference to the book of Revelation or the Christian perspective, which reduces the grade slightly."
