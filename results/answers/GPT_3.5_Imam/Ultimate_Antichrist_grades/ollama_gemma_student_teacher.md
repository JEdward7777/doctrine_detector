## Question [Ultimate Antichrist](../../../questions/Ultimate_Antichrist.md)

The beast in chapter 13 of Revelation is often identified as the ultimate antichrist, who will attempt to destroy Godâ€™s people but will ultimately be defeated by Jesus.

Being aware of eschatological figures helps Christians prepare for the challenges they may face in faith.

## [Answer](../Ultimate_Antichrist.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic eschatology, the figure often identified as the ultimate Antichrist is known as Al-Masih ad-Dajjal. Dajjal is described as a false messiah who will appear towards the end of times, spreading corruption and deception on earth. Muslims are warned to be wary of him, as he will possess great powers of deception and will lead many astray. It is believed that before the Day of Judgment, Prophet Jesus (Isa) will return to defeat the Dajjal and establish justice on earth.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
## Grade: 80

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the figure of the Antichrist in Islamic eschatology. They accurately identify Al-Masih ad-Dajjal as the Islamic equivalent and provide a concise description of his characteristics and role in eschatological beliefs. However, the answer lacks specific reference to the book of Revelation or the Christian perspective, which reduces the grade slightly.
