  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical perspective on adultery and its consequences. They provide relevant scriptures from both the Old and New Testaments to support their claims. Additionally, they acknowledge the difference between Islamic and Christian perspectives, which demonstrates cultural sensitivity. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern of evaluating the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality."
