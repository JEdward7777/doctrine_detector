However, the question specifically asked for the significance of \"Amen\" in a Christian context, not in Islam. In a Christian worldview, \"Amen\" is used at the end of a prayer to express agreement, affirmation, and submission to God rather than Allah. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and does not address the Christian understanding of \"Amen\" appropriately."
