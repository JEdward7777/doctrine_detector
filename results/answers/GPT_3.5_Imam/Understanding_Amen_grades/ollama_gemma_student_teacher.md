The term "Amen" is used in various faith traditions, including Islam, to signify agreement, affirmation, or acceptance. When used at the end of a prayer, it serves as a way for the one praying to express their agreement with the content of the prayer and submit it to Allah. It is a way of saying "may it be so" or "so be it," indicating the sincerity and intention of the one praying. In Islam, saying "Amen" at the end of a prayer is considered a Sunnah (recommended practice) and is encouraged as a way to confirm and affirm the supplication made.
