In a Christian worldview, prayer is more than just expressing agreement or desires; it is a personal and transformative communication with God, acknowledging His sovereignty, seeking His will, and building a relationship with Him. The response would benefit from including an explanation of the Christian perspective on prayer and how it differs from the Islamic understanding presented."
