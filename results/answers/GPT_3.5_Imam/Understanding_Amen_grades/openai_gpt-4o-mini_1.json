  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response accurately explains the use of \"Amen\" in Islamic prayer contexts, addressing the concern of expressing agreement or desire for the prayer to be fulfilled. However, the response lacks a clear connection to the significance of prayer in Christian practice, which is the specified concern. To improve the grade, it would be helpful to integrate more Christian-specific perspectives on prayer and the use of \"Amen\" within that context."
