  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately reflects the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" as God's sovereign choice, which aligns with the concern about divine selection and grace in salvation. The mention of God's will and grace is also consistent with Christian theology.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response does not fully develop the idea of predestination, which is a crucial aspect of the doctrine. Additionally, while it mentions that this concept is associated with Calvinism, it would have been helpful to provide more context or explanation about how other Christian denominations understand salvation and eternal life.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good starting point for exploring the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" from a Christian perspective, but could benefit from further elaboration and nuance."
