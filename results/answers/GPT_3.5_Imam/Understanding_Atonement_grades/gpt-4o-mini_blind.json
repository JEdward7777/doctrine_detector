The explanation lacked the crucial Christian doctrine of the necessity of Christ's death as the ultimate and perfect sacrifice to satisfy the justice of God and provide salvation for humanity. The response also did not emphasize the significance of Christ's death in fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and the covenant between God and His people. Additionally, it is important to be cautious in equating the Christian view of atonement solely with the Old Testament sacrificial system, as Christ's sacrificial death holds unique and central importance in Christian theology."
