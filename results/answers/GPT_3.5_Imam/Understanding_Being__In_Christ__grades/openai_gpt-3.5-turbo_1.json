The clarity in explaining the distinction and the focus on faith in Jesus as fundamental to being 'in Christ' aligns well with the concern provided. However, it could have further explored the uniqueness of Christ's redemptive work in the Christian faith compared to Islamic beliefs. Overall, a solid response from a Muslim Imam's perspective."
