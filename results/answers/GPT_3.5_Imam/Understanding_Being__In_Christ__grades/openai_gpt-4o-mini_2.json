It addresses the concern by clarifying the spiritual identity aspect in relation to faith in Jesus and provides a respectful perspective from an Islamic point of view. The only potential improvement could be providing more explicit references to specific Islamic teachings or beliefs that parallel or contrast with the Christian concept of being \"in Christ.\""
