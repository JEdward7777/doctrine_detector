  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the nuances between believing in something and believing in someone, particularly using examples from the Islamic context. They have captured the essence of faith in relation to trust in God and others, aligning well with the Christian worldview. A higher grade could be achieved by further elaborating on the importance of ultimate trust in God's sovereignty and faithfulness compared to trust in human beings who are fallible and limited. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a good grasp of the topic."
