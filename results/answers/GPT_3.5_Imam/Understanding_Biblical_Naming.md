## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the context of biblical naming, when the Bible states "His name is called John," it is referring to the naming of John the Baptist. In the New Testament, specifically in the Gospel of Luke, there is a passage where Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, names her son John despite objections from her relatives. This act was significant because it was seen as a sign of obedience to God's will, as the name "John" was specifically chosen by God.

The name "John" itself holds significance in the Christian tradition. In Hebrew, the name "John" means "Yahweh is gracious" or "God is gracious." This name reflects the belief that John the Baptist was a prophet chosen by God to prepare the way for the coming of Jesus Christ.

Overall, the naming of John in the Bible signifies God's intervention and divine purpose in the lives of individuals, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's will in matters of naming and beyond.
