  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The answer provided does not align with a Christian worldview, which is the context for grading this question. The response focuses solely on the Islamic perspective, which does not capture the significance of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob according to Biblical accounts. It lacks doctrinal correctness and does not address the implications for both brothers within a Christian framework. The answer could be improved by including insights specifically from the Bible, such as Esau despising his birthright and the consequences it had for both brothers in terms of blessings and inheritance."
