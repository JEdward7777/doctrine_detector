However, the answer does not directly address the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob according to Biblical accounts, which is the focus of the question. The response lacks a clear connection to the Christian worldview and the specific consequences outlined in the Bible for Esau and Jacob. It would have been more accurate to tie the consequences back to the Biblical account and its Christian implications."
