  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of being blameless before God from a Christian perspective. \n\nThe response accurately highlights the importance of obedience and honoring God, while clarifying the distinction between being blameless and being sinless. It provides a clear explanation of the spiritual journey required to achieve blamelessness, emphasizing the need for continuous effort, self-reflection, and reliance on God's mercy.\n\nHowever, the answer is not directly relevant to the question as it provides an Islamic perspective rather than a biblical one. This may be confusing for students who are specifically seeking a Christian interpretation."
