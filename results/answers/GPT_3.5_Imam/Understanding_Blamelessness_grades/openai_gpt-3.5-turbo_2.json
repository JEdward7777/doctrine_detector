However, the answer does not directly address the concern raised regarding the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context. It is essential to emphasize the Christian belief that being blameless before God is only attainable through the grace of Jesus Christ and faith in Him, which results in forgiveness of sins and justification in God's sight."
