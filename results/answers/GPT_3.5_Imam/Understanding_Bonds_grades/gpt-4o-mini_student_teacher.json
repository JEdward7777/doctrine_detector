  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful explanation of the Islamic perspective on fulfilling spiritual obligations and maintaining relationships. However, the student did not directly address the significance of vows and commitments, as outlined in the reference answer. To improve the grade, the student could have related the concept of 'Bonds of Kinship' more explicitly to the idea of making commitments in maintaining a healthy spiritual life."
