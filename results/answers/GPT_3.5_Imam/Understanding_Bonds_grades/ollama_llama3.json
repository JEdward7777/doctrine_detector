  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of \"bonds\" in Islam, highlighting its connection to spiritual obligations and relationships with God and others. While it does not directly address the biblical concept of \"bonds,\" it provides a nuanced understanding of the Islamic perspective on commitments and vows.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by exploring the significance of maintaining strong relationships with both God and others as a means of fulfilling spiritual obligations. The inclusion of Quranic verses and prophetic traditions adds credibility to the argument.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could further explore the biblical concept of \"bonds\" and how it compares to the Islamic perspective. Additionally, more explicit connections between the Islamic concepts discussed and the concern of maintaining a healthy spiritual life could be made."
