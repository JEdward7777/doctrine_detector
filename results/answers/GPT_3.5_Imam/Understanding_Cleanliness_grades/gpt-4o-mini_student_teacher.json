  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response focusing on Islamic teachings on cleanliness and moral purity, drawing parallels with the concepts in the Bible. However, the response does not directly address the Biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean' as symbols of moral purity from a Christian-specific worldview. The student's answer, though insightful, lacks the specific emphasis on the significance of spiritual cleanliness in the Biblical context."
