However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about the contrast between condemnation and grace in the Christian life. A connection to the specific biblical teaching on how Christ's sacrifice brings freedom from condemnation would have strengthened the response. Additionally, while encouraging consultation with Christian scholars is helpful, a more focused discussion on the specified concern would have been beneficial."
