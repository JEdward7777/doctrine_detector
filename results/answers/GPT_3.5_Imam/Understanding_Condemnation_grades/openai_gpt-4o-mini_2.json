However, the link to the Christian concept of grace through Christ is not clearly drawn. The response could have elaborated more on the contrast between condemnation for wrongdoing in Islam and the concept of no condemnation through Christ in Christianity. Further integration of Christian beliefs on grace and redemption would have strengthened the response."
