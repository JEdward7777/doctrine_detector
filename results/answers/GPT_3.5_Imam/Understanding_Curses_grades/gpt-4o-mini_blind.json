  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provided by the student correctly draws parallels between the teachings of Islam and the concept of refraining from cursing others as found in the Bible. However, as the question specifically asks for an interpretation of a Biblical passage, the response falls short by not directly addressing James 3:10 or providing insights from a Christian perspective. The student should strive to engage with the specific text referenced in the question more directly rather than offering a general comparison with Islamic teachings."
