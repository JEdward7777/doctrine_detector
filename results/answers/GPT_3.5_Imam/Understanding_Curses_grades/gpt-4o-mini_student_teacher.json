  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and respectful response from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing the importance of using good words and refraining from cursing or speaking ill of others in line with Islamic teachings. However, the response did not directly address the specific concern of understanding the implications of words and their alignment with God's teachings as per the Bible passage referenced. The Biblical perspective on the spiritual consequences of cursing and blessing coming from the same mouth was not discussed. A higher grade could have been achieved by directly addressing the implications outlined in James 3:10 and contrasting it with the Islamic perspective on the topic."
