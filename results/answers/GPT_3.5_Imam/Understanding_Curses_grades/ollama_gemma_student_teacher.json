  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the biblical passage and the importance of using words responsibly. However, it is important to note that the student's response is based on Islamic teachings rather than Christian interpretations. While there are parallels between Islamic and Christian teachings on the consequences of cursing, there are also significant differences in perspective and interpretation between the two religions. For full credit, the student would need to address the specific Christian perspective on the passage."
