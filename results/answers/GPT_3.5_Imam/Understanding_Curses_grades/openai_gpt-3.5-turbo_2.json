The reference to the Quranic instruction on speaking kindly to others and the quote from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) effectively support the point made. However, to enhance the response further, integrating more explicit connections to the Bible verse provided and potentially exploring further similarities or differences in teachings between Christianity and Islam on this topic could have strengthened the analysis."
