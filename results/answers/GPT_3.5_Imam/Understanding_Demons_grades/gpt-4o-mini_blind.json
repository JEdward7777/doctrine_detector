  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided some interesting information about Islamic beliefs regarding jinn, but it failed to directly address the question about the term \"unclean spirit\" in Christian teachings. The student should have focused on explaining the Christian perspective on demons and their significance in relation to the concept of \"unclean spirits.\" The answer also lacked depth and specific references to Christian sources or teachings. More emphasis on doctrinal correctness and clarity would have improved the grade."
