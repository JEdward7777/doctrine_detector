The writer correctly highlights the importance of believing in Jesus' prophethood, following his example, and upholding monotheism and submission to God.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern of understanding the definition and responsibilities of being a disciple. While it provides some insight into what it means to be a follower of Prophet Jesus in Islam, it does not explicitly define what it means to be a disciple or outline specific responsibilities.\n\nThe provided answer also serves as a good starting point for further exploration of this concept. For example, the response could have explored how being a disciple of Jesus in Christianity is different from being a follower of Prophet Jesus in Islam, and what implications this has for Christian-Muslim dialogue and understanding.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some valuable insights, it falls short of fully addressing the concern of understanding the definition and responsibilities of being a disciple."
