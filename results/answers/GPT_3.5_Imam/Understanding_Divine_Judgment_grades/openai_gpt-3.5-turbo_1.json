  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a clear comparison between God's perfect judgment as taught in the Bible and human judgment. It acknowledges the inherent flaws in human judgment and emphasizes the attributes of God's judgment as based on perfect righteousness and justice. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview and demonstrates a solid understanding of the distinction between God's judgment and human judgment from a Christian perspective."
