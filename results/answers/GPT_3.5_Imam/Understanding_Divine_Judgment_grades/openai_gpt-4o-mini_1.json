The Imam's explanation aligns with the Christian worldview in emphasizing the righteousness and justice of God's judgment compared to the fallibility of human judgment. The response appropriately draws parallels between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding judgment, demonstrating a thoughtful comparison while maintaining respect for both faith traditions."
