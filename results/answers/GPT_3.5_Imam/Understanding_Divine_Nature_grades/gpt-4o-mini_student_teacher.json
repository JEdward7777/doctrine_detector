  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful explanation of the term 'divine nature' as understood in Islam, highlighting essential attributes of Allah. However, considering the concern about understanding God's nature for developing a personal relationship and living according to His will, the student's answer did not directly address the Christian perspective on divine nature as provided in the teacher's reference answer. The response focused more on Islamic beliefs rather than addressing the Christian-specific worldview."
