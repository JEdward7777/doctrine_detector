  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of the concept of inheriting eternal life as presented in the Bible, emphasizing the importance of faith in God, living according to His commandments, and following Jesus' teachings. The student effectively references key passages from both the Gospels and the epistles of Paul to support their points. However, to improve the answer, the student could have included more explicit references to key biblical verses that directly address inheriting eternal life as a concept. Additionally, further elaboration on the role of grace and the atonement of Christ in obtaining eternal life would have strengthened the response. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview."
