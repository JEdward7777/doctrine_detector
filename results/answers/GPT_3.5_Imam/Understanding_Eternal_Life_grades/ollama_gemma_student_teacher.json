It clearly articulates the role of faith in Jesus Christ and living a righteous life as essential components of salvation. The student also provides relevant scriptural references to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of obedience to God's laws as a necessary aspect of inheriting eternal life."
