  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 60.\n\nThe response provides a detailed explanation of how Islamic belief interprets and distinguishes between 'evil' and 'wickedness' in terms of moral character and behavior. However, it does not directly address the question asked, which specifically inquired about the distinction in the Bible. The answer also lacks references to scripture or specific teachings within the Bible. While the content provided is informative from an Islamic perspective, it does not align with the Christian worldview specified in the question. A more appropriate response would have focused on biblical teachings and principles regarding evil and wickedness.\n\nOverall, the answer shows a good understanding of the topic but misses the mark in terms of the question's requirements, hence the lower grade."
