  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while informative about the Islamic perspective on Jesus (Isa), does not align with the foundational aspect of faith in Christianity. The Christian view emphasizes faith in Jesus as the Son of God who came to die for the sins of humanity and to offer salvation through his sacrifice. The student's response focuses on Jesus as a prophet in Islam rather than the core Christian belief in Jesus as the savior and redeemer."
