## [Answer](../Understanding_Faith.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
Having faith in Jesus, or Isa (peace be upon him) in Arabic, means believing in him as a prophet and messenger of Allah (God). For Muslims, Jesus is a revered figure who was sent by Allah to deliver the message of monotheism and teach morality to his people. Having faith in Jesus entails accepting his teachings, miracles, and his eventual return in the future according to Islamic beliefs.

Muslims believe in the miraculous birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary, his ability to perform miracles with the permission of Allah, and the fact that he was not crucified but was raised to the heavens by Allah. Having faith in Jesus also means recognizing his important role in the final days, as he will return to establish justice and peace on earth before the Day of Judgment.

Overall, having faith in Jesus as a Muslim means acknowledging his status as a noble prophet and showing respect for his teachings and the miracles he performed during his time on earth.
