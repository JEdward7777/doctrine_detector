However, since the question specifically asks about a person's belief in God according to the content, the answer could have delved deeper into the implications of being \"faithless\" in relation to one's belief in God within the context of Islamic teachings. Additionally, providing more specific references to Islamic scriptures or teachings would have strengthened the response."
