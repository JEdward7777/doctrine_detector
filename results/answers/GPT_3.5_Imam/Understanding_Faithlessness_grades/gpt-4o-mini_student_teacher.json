  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of what the term \"faithless\" implies in the context of Islam, emphasizing the importance of faith in the religion. However, the student's answer focused more on the theological aspects of faith rather than directly addressing the concern of the significance of faith in moral conduct. The student could have connected the lack of faith to a potential impact on moral behavior to better address the concern provided."
