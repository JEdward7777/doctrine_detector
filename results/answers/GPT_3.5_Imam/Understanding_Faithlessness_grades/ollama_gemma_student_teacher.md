From an Islamic perspective, faith (iman) is a central tenet of the religion, and it is essential for a person to have belief in God to be considered a true believer. The Quran emphasizes the importance of faith in many verses, and describes those who reject faith as "kafir" or "faithless." This term indicates a lack of belief in God and the teachings of Islam, which is considered a serious spiritual condition.
