  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively ties the concept of faithlessness to moral conduct by highlighting how lack of belief in God can result in immoral actions. It also emphasizes the importance of faith in Islam and how it is intrinsically linked to moral behavior. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or Qur'anic references to further demonstrate the connection between faith and moral conduct in Islamic teachings."
