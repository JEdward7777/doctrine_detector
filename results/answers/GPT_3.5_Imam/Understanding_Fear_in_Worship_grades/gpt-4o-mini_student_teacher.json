  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation of the concept of fear in Islam and contrasted it with the concept of fear in the Bible. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of how understanding the biblical definition of fear can deepen one's relationship with God and enhance worship practices. The student could have further elaborated on the importance of fear as an attitude of worship, respect, and awe towards God in the Christian faith."
