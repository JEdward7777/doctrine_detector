They correctly highlighted the historical view of Gentiles as unclean and the shift in perspective brought about by Christian teachings. However, the response could be strengthened by delving deeper into specific biblical examples and passages that illustrate the tensions and resolutions within the early church regarding Gentiles. Additionally, a more explicit connection to Christian doctrine regarding unity in Christ and acceptance of all people would enhance the overall doctrinal correctness of the answer."
