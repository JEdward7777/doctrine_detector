## [Answer](../Understanding_Gentiles_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the early church, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles played a significant role in shaping their relationships with them. Historically, the Israelites viewed Gentiles as unclean or impure, and there was a sense of cultural and religious superiority among the Israelites.

However, with the spread of Christianity, particularly through the teachings of Jesus and the work of the apostles, there was a shift in perspective. The message of Christianity emphasized love, forgiveness, and inclusion for all people, regardless of their background or ethnicity. This message challenged the longstanding beliefs of cultural and religious superiority held by the Israelites.

As a result, the early church had to navigate tensions between the Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians. Issues such as dietary restrictions, circumcision, and adherence to Jewish laws became points of contention. The apostles and early Christian leaders worked to bridge these divides and create a sense of unity among believers.

Ultimately, the teachings of Christianity emphasized love, acceptance, and equality for all people, regardless of their cultural or religious background. While there were challenges in the early church due to differing perceptions of Gentiles, the overarching message was one of inclusivity and unity in Christ.
