## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, we believe that all human beings are called by God to submit to His will and to worship Him alone. This call is inherent in our very existence as it is mentioned in the Quran that God created humans and jinn to worship Him (Quran 51:56). 

In Christianity, the concept of being "called" by God can be understood in various ways depending on the Christian denomination and interpretation. Generally, it refers to the belief that God has a specific purpose or plan for individuals and that he communicates this through various means such as prayer, scripture, and spiritual experiences.

For Christians, being called by God can involve a sense of God's guidance or leading towards a particular vocation, ministry, or mission. It can also refer to a personal relationship with God in which one feels a deep conviction or prompting to fulfill a specific role or to live a life according to God's teachings.

Regardless of the differences in theology between Islam and Christianity, the concept of being called by God signifies a profound spiritual experience and a sense of purpose and direction in one's life. It is a reminder for individuals to continuously seek God's guidance and to strive to fulfill the purpose for which they were created.
