  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a well-articulated explanation of how the title \"Most High\" pertains to Allah in Islam, and emphasizes submission, accountability, humility, and worship, the response does not address the significance of the title 'Most High' in relation to God's authority specifically in Christianity. The doctrinal correctness is key in this question, so the grade reflects the deviation from providing a Christian perspective on the title's significance."
