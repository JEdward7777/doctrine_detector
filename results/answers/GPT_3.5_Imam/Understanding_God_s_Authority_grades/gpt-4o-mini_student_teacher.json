However, the concern specifically mentioned believers struggling to comprehend God's sovereignty in their personal lives, which was not directly addressed in the response. While the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of God's authority as the Most High, tying it back to personal struggles or implications for believers would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
