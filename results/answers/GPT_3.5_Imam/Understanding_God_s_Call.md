## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Allah knows each and every one of us by name and has called us to Him through various means, such as the teachings of the Quran and the guidance of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This concept is similar to the idea in Christianity that God has called us by name in the Bible.

In Islam, when we say that Allah has called us by name, we mean that He has a unique and personal connection with each of His creation. He knows us individually and cares for us, guiding us towards righteousness and rewarding us for our good deeds. This personal relationship with Allah is emphasized in Islamic teachings, encouraging believers to strengthen their faith and connection with Him through prayers, good deeds, and seeking His forgiveness.

Overall, the concept of being called by name by God reflects the idea of a personal and loving relationship between the Creator and His creation, which is a central theme in both Islam and Christianity.
