While similarities between Islam and Christianity are noted, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview, which is essential for addressing the question effectively. It is crucial to emphasize the unique nature of the personal relationship and calling by name as depicted in the Bible. Adding references to specific biblical passages or theological teachings would enhance the response significantly."
