However, the response lacked clarity and specificity in explaining the Christian understanding of this concept. It did not delve deeply into the biblical basis or nuances of divine calling in Christianity. Additionally, the comparison between Islam and Christianity seemed to overshadow the Christian viewpoint. Improvement can be made by focusing more on the distinct Christian beliefs about being called by God and supporting them with relevant biblical references."
