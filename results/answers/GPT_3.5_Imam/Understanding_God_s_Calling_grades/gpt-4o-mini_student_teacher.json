They touch on the different interpretations within Christianity and accurately describe the general understanding of being called by God. However, there is room for improvement in clearly articulating the Christian perspective and divine calling as it relates to understanding personal purpose in the context of faith. The answer could have been strengthened by focusing more on God's specific purpose for individuals within the Christian worldview."
