  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student failed to answer the question with a Christian-specific worldview. The response focused on Islamic beliefs about Jesus rather than biblical teachings. In order to improve the grade, the student needs to provide an answer that aligns with Christian doctrine and scripture regarding Jesus' favor with God and men."
