In the Islamic perspective, Jesus (peace be upon him) was definitely favored by God and held in high regard by many people. The Quran mentions the story of Jesus and honors him as a prophet of God and as the Messiah. Jesus' favor with God is demonstrated in the Quran through various miracles he performed, such as speaking as a baby and curing the blind and the lepers.

As for favor with men, Jesus was respected and followed by many during his time. He was known for his teachings of love, compassion, and mercy, which resonated with people and attracted them to him. However, it's important to note that in Islamic belief, Jesus was a prophet like many others who came before him, and his message was in line with the teachings of previous prophets, including Moses and Abraham.

Overall, Jesus demonstrated favor with God through his righteousness and miracles, and with men through his wise teachings and kind demeanor as a prophet of God.
