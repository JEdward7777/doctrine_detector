While it acknowledges Jesus' high regard in Islam, it falls short in emphasizing the importance of Christians striving to emulate the qualities of Jesus to receive favor from both God and others. A Christian-specific worldview would emphasize the unique nature of Jesus as the Son of God and the ultimate example for Christians to follow."
