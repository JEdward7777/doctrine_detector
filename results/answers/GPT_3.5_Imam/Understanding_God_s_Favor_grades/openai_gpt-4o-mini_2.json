From a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize that Jesus' favor with God and men was due to His perfect righteousness, sacrificial love, and obedience to the will of God. The response could have highlighted these qualities as aspirations for Christians to emulate in order to truly reflect the character of Jesus."
