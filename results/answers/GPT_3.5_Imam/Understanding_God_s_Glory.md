## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Bible, the concept of God's glory is often associated with His majesty, power, holiness, and perfection. It refers to the resplendent magnificence and beauty of God's character, attributes, and actions. God's glory is transcendent and incomparable to any worldly sources of glory.

On the other hand, worldly sources of glory are often linked to material possessions, success, status, and recognition from others. This type of glory is temporary, superficial, and often tied to human pride and ego. It is fleeting, insecure, and does not have the lasting, eternal significance that God's glory possesses.

As Muslims, we also believe in the concept of God's glory and recognize that His glory is unmatched and beyond the limitations of the worldly sources of glory. We strive to seek His pleasure and approval, rather than the temporary and illusionary glories of this world.
