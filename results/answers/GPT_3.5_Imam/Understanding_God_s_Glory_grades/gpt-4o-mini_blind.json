However, the response would have been stronger if it had focused solely on the Christian perspective, as the question was framed within a biblical context. The reference to Muslims towards the end slightly deviates from the Christian-specific worldview. Additionally, expanding on how God's glory is ultimately centered on His redemptive work through Jesus Christ would have enhanced the answer."
