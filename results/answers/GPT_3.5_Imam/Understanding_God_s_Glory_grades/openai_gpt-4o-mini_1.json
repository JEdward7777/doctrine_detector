The discussion on the transient nature of worldly glory and the focus on seeking God's pleasure align well with the Christian belief in the supreme nature of God's glory. Connecting the concept of God's glory to proper worship demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of recognizing and honoring God's majestic glory in worship."
