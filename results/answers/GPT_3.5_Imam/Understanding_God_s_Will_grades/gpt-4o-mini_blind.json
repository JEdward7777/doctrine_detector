However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that the teachings of the Quran and the life of Prophet Muhammad are not considered authoritative sources of revelation for Christians. The answer would benefit from emphasizing the importance of seeking God's will through prayer, studying the Bible, consulting wise Christian counsel, and aligning decisions with biblical teachings and the example of Jesus Christ. Additionally, the concept of taqwa should be expanded upon to include the importance of developing a personal relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ."
