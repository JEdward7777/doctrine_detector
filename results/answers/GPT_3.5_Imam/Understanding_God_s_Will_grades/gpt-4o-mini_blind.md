Seeking God's will in our everyday decisions means making an effort to align our choices and actions with the teachings and guidance provided by God in the Quran and through the life of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It involves consciously seeking to understand what is pleasing to Allah and what is in accordance with His commandments and principles.

This process can include:

1. Seeking guidance through prayer: Before making important decisions, it is recommended to perform Istikhara prayer, which is a prayer specifically meant to seek guidance from Allah.

2. Consulting knowledgeable individuals: Seeking advice from trustworthy scholars or individuals who are well-versed in Islamic teachings can also help us make decisions that are in line with God's will.

3. Reflecting on the Quran and Sunnah: Regularly studying and reflecting on the Quran and the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) can provide us with insights and guidance on how to navigate various situations in our lives.

4. Developing taqwa (God-consciousness): Cultivating a sense of mindfulness and awareness of Allah in our daily lives can help us make decisions that are pleasing to Him.

By actively seeking God's will in our everyday decisions, we strive to live a life that is in accordance with Islamic principles and values, ultimately fostering a sense of closeness to Allah and earning His pleasure.

Grade: 70

Comment: The answer provides a good overall understanding of seeking God's will in everyday decisions from an Islamic perspective. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that the teachings of the Quran and the life of Prophet Muhammad are not considered authoritative sources of revelation for Christians. The answer would benefit from emphasizing the importance of seeking God's will through prayer, studying the Bible, consulting wise Christian counsel, and aligning decisions with biblical teachings and the example of Jesus Christ. Additionally, the concept of taqwa should be expanded upon to include the importance of developing a personal relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ.
