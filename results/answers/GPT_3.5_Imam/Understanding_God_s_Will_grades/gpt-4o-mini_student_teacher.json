  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out and detailed explanation of seeking God's will in everyday decisions from an Islamic perspective, which is commendable. However, the concern specifically referenced seeking God's will with a Christian worldview. The student's answer focuses solely on Islamic teachings and practices, so it does not fully address the concern provided. The student effectively explained the Islamic approach to seeking God's will, but lacked integration of Christian specific principles and teachings."
