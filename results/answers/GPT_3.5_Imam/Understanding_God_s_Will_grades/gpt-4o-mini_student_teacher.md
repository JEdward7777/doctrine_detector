By actively seeking God's will in our everyday decisions, we strive to live a life that is in accordance with Islamic principles and values, ultimately fostering a sense of closeness to Allah and earning His pleasure.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a well-thought-out and detailed explanation of seeking God's will in everyday decisions from an Islamic perspective, which is commendable. However, the concern specifically referenced seeking God's will with a Christian worldview. The student's answer focuses solely on Islamic teachings and practices, so it does not fully address the concern provided. The student effectively explained the Islamic approach to seeking God's will, but lacked integration of Christian specific principles and teachings.
