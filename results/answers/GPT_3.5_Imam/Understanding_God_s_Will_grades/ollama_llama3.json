  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively expands on the concept of seeking God's will, providing specific examples and practices that can help individuals align their decisions with God's desires and plans. The mention of prayer, consulting knowledgeable individuals, reflecting on Scripture, and developing taqwa (God-consciousness) are all relevant and valuable approaches to seeking guidance.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is in its connection to the concern being addressed. While it does acknowledge that people may struggle with making decisions that honor God, it does not explicitly address how the methods outlined can help alleviate this struggle or provide a sense of direction for one's life. Additionally, the focus on Islamic principles and values may not directly resonate with readers who do not share the same religious background.\n\nHowever, overall, this response provides a rich and practical exploration of seeking God's will, and its grade of 85 reflects its value in this area."
