  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: The student's answer provides a respectful comparison between Islam and Christianity in relation to the concept of God's wrath, acknowledging the significance of the Bible to Christians and Jews. However, the answer primarily focuses on Islamic beliefs and does not directly address what the Bible teaches about God's wrath and how it differs from human anger. To improve the grade, the student should have provided a more detailed explanation of the Biblical perspective on God's wrath compared to human anger, drawing from specific verses and teachings from the Bible."
