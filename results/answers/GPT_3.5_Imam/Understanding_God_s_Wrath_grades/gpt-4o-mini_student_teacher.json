  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a respectful and comparative approach between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding God's wrath. While the student acknowledges the concept of God's wrath in the Bible and Islamic teachings, there is a lack of depth and specific explanation regarding the nature of God's wrath as described in the Christian worldview. The response would benefit from more focus on the specific characteristics of God's wrath in Christianity as outlined in the reference answer."
