  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a generally accurate explanation of grace in a Christian context, mentioning its unmerited nature and connection to salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the response includes unnecessary comparison with Islam, which detracts from a clear explanation of God's unmerited favor specifically in Christianity. Additionally, the student could have elaborated more on the concept of grace as a gift from God and its implications for believers."
