The inclusion of how Christians believe they are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ adds depth to the explanation. However, the response could have further elaborated on how God's grace is central to the Christian doctrine of salvation, particularly in contrast to the concept of grace in Islam. This deeper comparison would have strengthened the response and provided a more comprehensive understanding of God's unmerited favor from a Christian worldview."
