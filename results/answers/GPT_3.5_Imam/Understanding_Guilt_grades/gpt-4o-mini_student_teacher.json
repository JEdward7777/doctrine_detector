  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would rate this student's answer a 30.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding guilt and repentance, the answer does not directly address the question from a Christian standpoint, as specified in the teacher's reference answer. The focus on Islamic beliefs, teachings, and practices does not align with the Christian worldview sought in the response. To improve their grade, the student needs to provide an answer that directly reflects the Christian perspective on guilt according to the Bible."
