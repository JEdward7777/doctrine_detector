  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective on the concept of heaven, but they did not address the concern of understanding the biblical definitions of 'heaven' and 'sky.' The focus on Islamic teachings rather than the requested Christian worldview is the main reason for the low grade. Additionally, the student did not compare or contrast the Islamic and biblical views on heaven and sky, which was essential based on the concern provided."
