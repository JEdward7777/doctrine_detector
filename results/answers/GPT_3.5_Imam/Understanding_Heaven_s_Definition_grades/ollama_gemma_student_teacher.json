  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinction between heaven and sky from a Islamic perspective. However, it is not relevant to the biblical definition of heaven as requested in the question. The response provides information about Jannah from Islamic teachings, which is not within the scope of the specified concern. While the description of Jannah is vivid and insightful, it does not address the biblical definition of heaven as requested."
