  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comparison between the concepts of being an heir in Islam and Christianity but did not adequately address the specific concern of exploring the identity of Christians as heirs of God's promises. The student correctly highlighted the spiritual aspect of receiving God's promises in Christianity but missed linking it to the identity of Christians as heirs. There is room for improvement in connecting the concept of being an heir to the Christian understanding of receiving God's promises."
