It effectively discusses the difference in emphasis between material inheritance in Islam and spiritual inheritance in Christianity. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview by highlighting the importance of faith, salvation, and eternal life as the basis for Christians being viewed as heirs of God's promises. It would have been even more impactful if it had delved deeper into specific Bible verses or teachings that support the concept of Christians being heirs of God's promises."
