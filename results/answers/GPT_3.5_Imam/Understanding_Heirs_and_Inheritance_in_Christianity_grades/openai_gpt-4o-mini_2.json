The explanation could be more detailed in connecting the identity of Christians as heirs to their relationship with God and the implications of this inheritance in their daily lives and spiritual growth. Nonetheless, it effectively distinguishes between the material inheritance in Islam and the spiritual inheritance in Christianity."
