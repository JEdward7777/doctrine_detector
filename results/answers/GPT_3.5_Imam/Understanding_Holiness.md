## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The concept of God being absolutely holy in Islam is known as "Tanzih" or transcendence. This means that God is completely separate and distinct from His creation in His perfection, purity, and majesty. His holiness is beyond human comprehension and is free from any imperfection or flaw. 

This understanding should impact our relationship with God in several ways. Firstly, it should instill in us a deep sense of reverence and awe towards Him. Recognizing His absolute holiness should lead us to humble ourselves before Him, knowing that He is beyond any human understanding or limitation.

Secondly, understanding God's holiness should motivate us to strive for moral purity and righteousness in our lives. As His creation, we should aim to embody the qualities of goodness and integrity that reflect His perfection.

Lastly, acknowledging God's absolute holiness should encourage us to turn to Him in sincere devotion and worship. Through prayer, seeking forgiveness, and adhering to His commandments, we can strengthen our relationship with Him and experience the peace and guidance that come from being close to the Most Holy.
