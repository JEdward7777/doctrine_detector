  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student gives a thorough explanation of the concept of God's absolute holiness in Islam and how it should impact our relationship with Him. However, the response does not directly address the concern of our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God. The student could improve the answer by incorporating more explicitly Christian perspectives on sinfulness and the need for redemption through Christ for approaching a holy God."
