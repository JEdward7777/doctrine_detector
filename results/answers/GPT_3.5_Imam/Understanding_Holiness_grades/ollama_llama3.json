  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response is strong in that it accurately captures the core idea of God's absolute holiness as understood in Islam, which is that He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection. The author also provides some thoughtful reflections on how understanding God's holiness should impact our relationship with Him, including a sense of reverence and awe, striving for moral purity, and seeking devotion and worship.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting these ideas to the concern raised in the question, which is reflection on our own holiness and necessary steps for approaching a holy God. While the author touches on this theme, it is not fully developed throughout the response.\n\nOverall, the grade of 85 reflects the response's strengths in clearly conveying the concept of God's absolute holiness and providing some insightful thoughts on its implications for our relationship with Him. With more attention to connecting these ideas to the concern, the response could be even stronger."
