What does it mean for God to be absolutely holy, and how does that affect our relationship with Him?

## Stated Concern
This question prompts reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
The concept of God being absolutely holy in Islam is known as "Tanzih" or transcendence. This means that God is completely separate and distinct from His creation in His perfection, purity, and majesty. His holiness is beyond human comprehension and is free from any imperfection or flaw. 

This understanding should impact our relationship with God in several ways. Firstly, it should instill in us a deep sense of reverence and awe towards Him. Recognizing His absolute holiness should lead us to humble ourselves before Him, knowing that He is beyond any human understanding or limitation.

Secondly, understanding God's holiness should motivate us to strive for moral purity and righteousness in our lives. As His creation, we should aim to embody the qualities of goodness and integrity that reflect His perfection.

Lastly, acknowledging God's absolute holiness should encourage us to turn to Him in sincere devotion and worship. Through prayer, seeking forgiveness, and adhering to His commandments, we can strengthen our relationship with Him and experience the peace and guidance that come from being close to the Most Holy.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 85.

This response is strong in that it accurately captures the core idea of God's absolute holiness as understood in Islam, which is that He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection. The author also provides some thoughtful reflections on how understanding God's holiness should impact our relationship with Him, including a sense of reverence and awe, striving for moral purity, and seeking devotion and worship.

However, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting these ideas to the concern raised in the question, which is reflection on our own holiness and necessary steps for approaching a holy God. While the author touches on this theme, it is not fully developed throughout the response.

Overall, the grade of 85 reflects the response's strengths in clearly conveying the concept of God's absolute holiness and providing some insightful thoughts on its implications for our relationship with Him. With more attention to connecting these ideas to the concern, the response could be even stronger.
