It appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the need for God's allowance to approach Him due to our sinful nature. The integration of Christian specific worldview could be strengthened by explicitly referencing Jesus Christ as the mediator between humanity's sinfulness and God's holiness, but overall, the response demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of God's holiness in shaping our approach to Him."
