  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response provides a thorough explanation of humility from a Muslim perspective, the answer does not address the question from a Christian viewpoint. The Christian perspective on humbling oneself before God involves submitting to His will and recognizing His greatness, as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer, although informative, does not align with the specific concern of understanding humility in relation to one's relationship with God from a Christian worldview."
