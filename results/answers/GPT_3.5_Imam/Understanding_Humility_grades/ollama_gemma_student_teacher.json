While the concepts of humility and submission to God are universal, the Christian understanding of humility involves a deeper surrender of oneself to God's will and a focus on Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate act of humility. The answer would benefit from referencing relevant Christian scriptures or teachings that elaborate on humility in the Christian context."
