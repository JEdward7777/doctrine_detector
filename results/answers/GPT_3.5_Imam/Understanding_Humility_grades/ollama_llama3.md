From a Muslim perspective, humbling oneself before God is known as humility or 'Tawadu'. It is an essential characteristic and quality of a believer in Islam. Humility before Allah involves recognizing one's own weaknesses, limitations, and faults, and acknowledging the greatness, power, and mercy of Allah.

Muslims are encouraged to be humble in their prayers, interactions with others, and in their overall attitude towards life. When a person humbles themselves before Allah, they submit to His will, seek forgiveness for their sins, and strive to improve themselves in order to please Him.

In Islam, humility is seen as a virtue that leads to spiritual growth, inner peace, and a closer relationship with Allah. It is also a way to show gratitude for the countless blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us. By being humble before God, a Muslim demonstrates their obedience, gratitude, and devotion to Him.
