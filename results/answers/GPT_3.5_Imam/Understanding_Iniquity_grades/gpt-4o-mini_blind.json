  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The answer provided does not address the biblical distinction between iniquity, sin, and transgression as requested in the question. The response focuses on Islamic teachings rather than providing insights from a Christian worldview. Additionally, there is no mention of the theological nuances and distinctions present in the Bible regarding these terms. The grade reflects the lack of relevance to the question and the absence of a Christian perspective."
