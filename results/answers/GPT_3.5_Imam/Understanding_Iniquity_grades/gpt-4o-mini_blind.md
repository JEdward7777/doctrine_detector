## Question [Understanding Iniquity](../../../questions/Understanding_Iniquity.md)
What is the biblical distinction between iniquity, sin, and transgression?

Iniquity refers more specifically to deliberate acts of wrongdoing or great wickedness, while sin encompasses a broader range of moral failings, and transgression involves violating a command or law.

## Stated Concern
Understanding these distinctions can help Christians better recognize the gravity of their actions and seek repentance.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Iniquity.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I can provide insight based on Islamic teachings rather than a biblical perspective. In Islam, the concept of sin and wrongdoing is categorized in different ways as well.

1. Sin (Ma'siya): This refers to any act or deed that goes against the commandments of Allah and His teachings. It includes actions, words, or even thoughts that are forbidden in Islam.

2. Iniquity (Fisq): This is a broader term in Islam that refers to a state of disobedience or sinfulness. It encompasses all forms of wrongdoing, rebellion against Allah, and living a life contrary to Islamic values and principles.

3. Transgression (Tughyan): This term refers to going beyond the limits set by Allah and committing acts of rebellion and defiance. It involves intentionally crossing the boundaries of what is permissible and indulging in excessive sinfulness.

In Islam, all these terms are used to describe various forms of disobedience and wrongdoing that distance a person from the path of righteousness and piety. Muslims are encouraged to seek forgiveness for their sins, repent sincerely, and strive to avoid falling into the trap of iniquity and transgression.
