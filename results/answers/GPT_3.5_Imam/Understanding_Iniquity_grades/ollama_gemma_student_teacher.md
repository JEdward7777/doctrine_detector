## [Answer](../Understanding_Iniquity.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I can provide insight based on Islamic teachings rather than a biblical perspective. In Islam, the concept of sin and wrongdoing is categorized in different ways as well.

1. Sin (Ma'siya): This refers to any act or deed that goes against the commandments of Allah and His teachings. It includes actions, words, or even thoughts that are forbidden in Islam.

2. Iniquity (Fisq): This is a broader term in Islam that refers to a state of disobedience or sinfulness. It encompasses all forms of wrongdoing, rebellion against Allah, and living a life contrary to Islamic values and principles.

3. Transgression (Tughyan): This term refers to going beyond the limits set by Allah and committing acts of rebellion and defiance. It involves intentionally crossing the boundaries of what is permissible and indulging in excessive sinfulness.

In Islam, all these terms are used to describe various forms of disobedience and wrongdoing that distance a person from the path of righteousness and piety. Muslims are encouraged to seek forgiveness for their sins, repent sincerely, and strive to avoid falling into the trap of iniquity and transgression.
