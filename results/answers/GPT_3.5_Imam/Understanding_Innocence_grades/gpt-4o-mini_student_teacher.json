  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of innocence in Islam, the response did not address the question asked about the biblical teachings regarding innocence in the context of being wrongfully accused. It is important for the student to focus on responding directly to the question and providing insights aligned with the Christian worldview in order to receive a higher grade."
