  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the Islamic perspective on innocence in the context of being wrongfully accused. It recognizes the importance of justice, fairness, and support for the innocent individual within the Islamic faith. However, the grade is slightly lower due to the response not directly addressing the concern regarding Christian teachings on innocence. In a Christian specific worldview, innocence is also linked to the concept of being free from guilt and deserving of mercy through the grace and forgiveness of God. An integration of both perspectives could have enriched the response further."
