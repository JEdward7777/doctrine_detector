It highlights the importance of upholding justice, protecting the rights of the accused, and supporting the innocent in both religious traditions. The Christian-specific concern is addressed with a solid understanding of how innocence is defined and its implications for justice and mercy in Christian teachings. The only point for improvement could be a bit more explicit connection back to the Christian context in the response."
