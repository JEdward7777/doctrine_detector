  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer is not relevant to the question asked, as it diverges into an explanation of Islamic beliefs about intercession rather than addressing the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession as per the Christian perspective. The answer lacks an understanding of the specific concern provided and does not engage with the reference answer provided by the teacher. A more focused response on the Christian view of the Holy Spirit's involvement in prayer and intercession is needed to receive a higher grade."
