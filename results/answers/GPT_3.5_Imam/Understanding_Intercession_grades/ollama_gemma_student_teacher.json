  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 0\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear misunderstanding of the Christian understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in intercession. The text confuses Islamic beliefs about intercession with Christianity and fails to address the concern of the prompt. The response provides irrelevant information about Islamic beliefs and ignores the Bible-based perspective requested."
