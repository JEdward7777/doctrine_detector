However, it does not directly address the concern of deepening understanding of the Holy Spirit's involvement in prayer and intercession as taught in the Bible from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to make a clearer comparison with the Christian concept of the Holy Spirit's intercession in prayer."
