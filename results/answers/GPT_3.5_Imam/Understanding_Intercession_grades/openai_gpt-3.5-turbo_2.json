  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response adequately explains the Islamic perspective on intercession but does not address the concern directly in deepening the understanding of the Holy Spirit's involvement in prayer and intercession according to the Christian worldview. More direct comparison or discussion on the role and nature of the Holy Spirit in relation to prayer and intercession in Christianity would have been beneficial for a higher grade."
