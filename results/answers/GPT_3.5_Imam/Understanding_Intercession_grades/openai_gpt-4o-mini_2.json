However, the response does not address the concern of deepening understanding on the Holy Spirit's involvement in prayer and intercession within a Christian worldview. It fails to engage with the specific teaching from the Bible about the Holy Spirit's role in interceding for believers. The focus is more on explaining Islamic beliefs rather than addressing the concern provided."
