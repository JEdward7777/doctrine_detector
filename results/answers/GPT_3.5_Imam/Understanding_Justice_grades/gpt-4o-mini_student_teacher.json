  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of what it means to act justly according to God's laws, focusing on fairness, righteousness, and kindness towards others. However, the response included references to verses from the Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammad, which are not aligned with a Christian worldview. The student's explanation could have been strengthened by focusing solely on Christian perspectives and teachings."
