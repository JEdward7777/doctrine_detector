  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of acting justly according to God's laws, particularly within the Islamic context. While the response draws on Quranic verses and teachings of Prophet Muhammad to emphasize the importance of justice, fairness, and integrity, it lacks specific references to the Christian perspective. To improve the grade, the response could integrate biblical passages and teachings that highlight the Christian standard of fairness and righteousness in interactions with others."
