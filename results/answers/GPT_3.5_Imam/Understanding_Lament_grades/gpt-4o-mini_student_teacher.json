However, the student did not directly address the concern stated, which specifically focused on Christians struggling with expressing sorrows and regrets in a faith context. The answer would have been stronger if it had integrated how Christians can use lamentation as a means to process emotions, seek comfort in God, and draw closer to Him in times of difficulty, aligning more closely with a Christian worldview."
