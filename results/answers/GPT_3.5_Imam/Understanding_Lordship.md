This is based on passages like Philippians 2:9-11, which states that "God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

So, in summary, in relation to God, the term "Lord" signifies supreme authority and deity. In relation to Jesus, the term "Lord" signifies his divinity and rightful rule over all creation.
