  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid explanation of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible, highlighting the concepts of authority and divinity. The answer effectively discusses the significance of the term in both the Old and New Testaments, showing an understanding of its theological implications. However, to align more closely with the Christian worldview, the student could have emphasized more explicitly that the term \"Lord\" signifies ownership or authority and is a title for God, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. This would have strengthened the connection to recognizing the authority and divinity of God and Jesus."
