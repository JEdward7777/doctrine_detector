  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's character. However, the response does not directly address the specific concern of understanding God's attributes and His sovereignty over creation from a Christian worldview, which was the focus of the question. Additionally, the reference answer from the teacher offers a more concise and direct Christian perspective on the concept of 'majesty' in relation to God. The student should incorporate more Christian-specific views in their explanation to align better with the concern provided."
