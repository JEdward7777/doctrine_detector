  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that highlights the importance of demonstrating mercy in daily life as exemplified by God's merciful nature in Islam. The student's answer offers specific actions to embody mercy, such as showing kindness, forgiveness, and helping those in need, which align with the concern provided. However, the response focused solely on Islamic teachings and did not incorporate a Christian-specific perspective or reference to God's merciful nature as exemplified in the Bible. To improve the grade, the student could have integrated Christian teachings on mercy and referenced examples from the Bible to demonstrate how Christians can embody God's merciful nature in their interactions with others."
