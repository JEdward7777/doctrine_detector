However, the response lacks a clear explanation of what it means to be \"born again\" according to the Bible from a Christian perspective, which is the primary focus of the question. It could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the biblical understanding of being \"born again\" as a spiritual rebirth through faith in Jesus Christ. Additional biblical references or theological insights would strengthen the answer."
