  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response correctly explains the Christian perspective on being \"born again\" as the spiritual transformation through accepting Jesus Christ as Savior. However, the comments on Islam's perspective are not relevant to the concern provided which focuses on the Christian understanding of spiritual rebirth. The grade reflects the accuracy of the Christian perspective presented but deducts points for not addressing the concern directly."
