  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained answer about the concept of \"perishing\" in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. They correctly highlighted the consequences of rejecting God and the implications of spiritual separation from Him. However, the response included references to Islamic beliefs, which deviated from the Christian-specific worldview required for this evaluation. To improve the grade, the student should focus solely on the Christian perspective and provide more direct references from the New Testament to support their explanation."
