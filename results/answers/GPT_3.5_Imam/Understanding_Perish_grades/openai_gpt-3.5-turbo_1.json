  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the concept of \"perishing\" in a spiritual context as being lost or separated from the people of God due to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation. The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian teachings. Additionally, the response integrates a Biblical reference and highlights the consequences of rejecting God. It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the implications of spiritual separation from God in a Christian worldview."
