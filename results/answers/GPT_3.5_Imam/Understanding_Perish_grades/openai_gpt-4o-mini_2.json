It effectively explores the implications of spiritual separation from God by highlighting the contrast between those who believe in Jesus and have eternal life versus those who do not believe and perish. The response could be strengthened by further elaborating on the significance of eternal separation from God in terms of the ultimate loss and consequences for one's soul."
