  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response did not address the concern of how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy from a Christian perspective. While it is important to understand the Islamic viewpoint, the answer did not engage with the Christian worldview presented in the teacher's reference answer. The student should have focused on explaining how Jesus' sacrifice in the context of propitiation aligns with the concepts of God's justice and mercy within Christianity."
