  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the Islamic perspective on propitiation and the rejection of the concept of Jesus' sacrifice as a means of atonement. However, the response lacks a direct engagement with the concern of ensuring a clear understanding of how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy, as requested in the prompt. The response would benefit from further elaboration on how the Islamic understanding of forgiveness and redemption aligns with the concept of God's justice and mercy."
