However, from a Christian viewpoint, the answer lacks a discussion on how propitiation, specifically through Jesus' sacrifice, relates to God's justice and mercy. Providing a comparison or analysis of how Islam and Christianity differ in their understanding of God's justice and mercy in relation to propitiation would strengthen the response."
