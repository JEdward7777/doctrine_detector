However, the response does not address the concern of how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy from a Christian worldview. In Christianity, Jesus' sacrifice is significant because it satisfies the demands of God's justice by paying the penalty for sin, while also demonstrating God's mercy by providing a way for sinners to receive forgiveness and eternal life. In the Islamic perspective presented, there is an emphasis on individual responsibility and seeking forgiveness directly from Allah, rather than a sacrificial atonement for sins."
