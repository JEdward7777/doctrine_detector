  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of the significance of purification in the context of Old Testament laws, emphasizing its role in maintaining cleanliness before God and symbolically cleansing oneself of impurities and sins. However, the student did not fully address how the process of ritual purification reflects God\u2019s standards for holiness and the nature of sin as requested in the concern. The reference answer highlights the connection between purification and cleansing from ritual uncleanness and sin through animal sacrifices, which the student did not explicitly mention. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the importance of purification in the Old Testament, but could have delved deeper into the theological implications as per the concern provided."
