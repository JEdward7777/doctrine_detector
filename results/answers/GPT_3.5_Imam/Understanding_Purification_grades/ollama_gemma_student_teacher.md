Purification rituals were seen as a way to symbolically cleanse oneself of impurities and sins, making oneself suitable to come before God in worship and prayer.

There were various forms of purification rituals mentioned in the Old Testament, such as washing with water, offering sacrifices, and following specific dietary laws. These practices were meant to remind the Israelites of their commitment to God, their repentance for sins, and their desire to remain in a state of purity before Him.
