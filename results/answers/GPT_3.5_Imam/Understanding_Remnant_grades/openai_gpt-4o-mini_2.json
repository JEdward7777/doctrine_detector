It correctly addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of turning to faith in Allah for guidance and support. However, the response could have further emphasized the role of God's grace in sustaining believers during trials, in line with the reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding of finding strength in faith is demonstrated."
