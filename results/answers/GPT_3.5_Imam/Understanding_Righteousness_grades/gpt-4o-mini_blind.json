  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 60.\n\nWhile the student provides a clear explanation of what it means for God to be described as \"righteous\" in Islamic teachings, it is important to note that the question specifically asked for a Christian perspective. The response does not align with Christian beliefs regarding the righteousness of God. Additionally, the student should have connected the concept of God's righteousness to specific Christian teachings or scriptures to enhance the depth of the explanation.\n\nOverall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of divine righteousness from an Islamic viewpoint, but it lacks relevance to the Christian context."
