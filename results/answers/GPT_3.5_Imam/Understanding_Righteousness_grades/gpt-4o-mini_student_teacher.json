  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60. While the student did a good job explaining the concept of God's righteousness as understood in Islamic teachings, the answer does not fully align with the Christian understanding provided in the reference answer. In Christianity, God's righteousness is closely tied to His absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love, all pointing towards the condemnation of sin. The student's answer focused more on God's fairness and justice, but did not mention the crucial aspect of God's goodness and the consequences of sin in relation to His righteousness. It's important for the student to incorporate these elements to provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of God's righteousness from a Christian perspective."
