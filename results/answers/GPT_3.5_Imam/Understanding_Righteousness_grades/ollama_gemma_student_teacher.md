In Islamic teachings, when God is described as "righteous," it means that He is free from any form of injustice, wrongdoing, or bias. The term emphasizes His perfect justice, fairness, and upholding of what is right and good.

God's righteousness is reflected in His actions towards His creation, as He treats every individual with justice and wisdom. It also means that God fulfills His promises and obligations justly, without favoritism or discrimination. As Muslims, we believe in the righteousness of God, trusting in His wisdom and fairness in all matters.

Ultimately, God's righteousness serves as a source of comfort and assurance for believers, as they rely on His just nature in times of hardship and seek His guidance in every aspect of their lives.
