In Islamic teachings, when God is described as "righteous," it means that He is free from any form of injustice, wrongdoing, or bias. The term emphasizes His perfect justice, fairness, and upholding of what is right and good.

God's righteousness is reflected in His actions towards His creation, as He treats every individual with justice and wisdom. It also means that God fulfills His promises and obligations justly, without favoritism or discrimination. As Muslims, we believe in the righteousness of God, trusting in His wisdom and fairness in all matters.

Comment: While the response provides a good explanation of the Islamic perspective on God's righteousness, it does not directly engage with the given answer which focuses on God's absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love leading to the condemnation of sin. It would have been stronger if the response had explicitly connected Islamic teachings on God's righteousness with the provided answer, demonstrating an understanding of how different worldviews perceive and interpret this attribute of God.
