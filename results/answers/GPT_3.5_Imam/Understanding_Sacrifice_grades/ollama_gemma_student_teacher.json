The student correctly points out the Islamic perspective on sacrifice and acknowledges the significance of Jesus as a prophet in Islam. However, the answer lacks a deeper analysis of the theological significance of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate atonement for sins, which is the primary concern of the question."
