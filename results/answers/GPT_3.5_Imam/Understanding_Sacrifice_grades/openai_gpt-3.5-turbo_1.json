However, the Islamic perspective does not address the concern of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption from a Christian worldview. It is important to note that from a Christian standpoint, Jesus' sacrifice is seen as the ultimate and unique atonement for all humanity's sins, as prophesied in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New Testament."
