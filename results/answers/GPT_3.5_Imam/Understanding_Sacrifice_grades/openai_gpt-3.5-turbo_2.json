However, the response falls short of fully addressing the concern from a Christian worldview as it does not emphasize the uniqueness and importance of Jesus as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb in fulfilling God's plan for redemption. More emphasis on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology would have strengthened the response."
