'Shaddai' is not a name of Allah in the Hebrew Bible; it is a name of God in the Old Testament, specifically in the context of the Hebrew Scriptures. The term 'Shaddai' is used to refer to the God of Israel, not Allah. Additionally, the idea that 'Shaddai' emphasizes the power of Allah is incorrect in a Christian worldview, as Christians understand 'Shaddai' to emphasize God's power and sufficiency. The response does touch on some aspects of the term's significance, but the fundamental error in identifying 'Shaddai' as a name of Allah results in a lower grade."
