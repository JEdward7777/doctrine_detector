  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer is not accurate according to a Christian worldview. The term 'Shaddai' is not a name for Allah but rather a name for the Christian God in the Old Testament. The student's response does not demonstrate an understanding of the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. The answer also inaccurately portrays the usage and significance of 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament. Further study and understanding of Christian theology and the Hebrew language are needed for a more accurate explanation."
