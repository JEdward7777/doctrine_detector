  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a limited understanding of the term 'Shaddai' and its significance in the Old Testament. While the student correctly identifies the meaning of the term as \"Almighty\" or \"All-Sufficient,\" they fail to provide any theological or Scriptural evidence to support their claim. Additionally, the student's explanation of the origin and usage of the term is inaccurate. The term 'Shaddai' is not a name for Allah in Islamic tradition."
