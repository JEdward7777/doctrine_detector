However, the additional response provided veers off into an incorrect assertion that 'Shaddai' is a name for Allah, which is not consistent with Christian beliefs. The concern about understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture is partially addressed but gets muddled with the mention of Allah. Overall, the response demonstrates some understanding but lacks clarity and consistency in applying a Christian specific worldview."
