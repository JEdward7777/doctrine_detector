However, the response veers off track by equating 'Shaddai' with Allah and attributing Islamic characteristics to the term. This is not in line with a Christian worldview, which views 'Shaddai' as a name for the God of the Bible, not Allah. The concern regarding understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture is not fully addressed in the response."
