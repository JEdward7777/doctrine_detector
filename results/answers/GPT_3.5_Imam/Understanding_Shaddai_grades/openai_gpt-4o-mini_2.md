Grade: 40

Comment: The response correctly identifies the term 'Shaddai' as a Hebrew word meaning 'the Almighty' and used as a personal name for God in the Old Testament. However, the response veers off track by equating 'Shaddai' with Allah and attributing Islamic characteristics to the term. This is not in line with a Christian worldview, which views 'Shaddai' as a name for the God of the Bible, not Allah. The concern regarding understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture is not fully addressed in the response.
