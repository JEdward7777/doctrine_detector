  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that incorporated elements from Islamic teachings regarding Jesus and his resistance to temptations. While the strategies mentioned align closely with Christian principles of seeking refuge in God, having faith, and knowledge of scriptures, the answer could have been more focused on Jesus specifically as portrayed in the Bible. Additionally, there was some deviation from the Christian worldview by including Islamic beliefs. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of resisting temptation in the context of faith, but could have emphasized Jesus' role in a more Christian-centric manner."
