In Surah Al-Maryam (Chapter 19), verses 23-26, it is mentioned that Satan tried to tempt Jesus by persuading him to show off his miraculous powers, but Jesus sought refuge in Allah and rejected the temptations.

The strategies that Jesus used to resist the temptations presented by Satan can be derived from this account:
