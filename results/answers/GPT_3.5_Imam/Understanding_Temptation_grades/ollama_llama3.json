  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does a good job of providing specific examples from Islamic scripture to illustrate Jesus' strategies for resisting temptation, which aligns with the concern about understanding how to combat temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. The four strategies listed are all relevant and actionable, and the reference to Jesus seeking refuge in Allah is particularly effective.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting these strategies to Christian theology and practice. For example, the writer could have noted how Jesus' reliance on scripture and faith in God parallels the importance of studying Scripture and trusting in God's sovereignty in Christian tradition. Additionally, while the response does not necessarily contradict Christian teachings, it does not directly engage with them either.\n\nOverall, while this response is well-organized and informative, it could benefit from a more explicit connection to Christian theology and practice."
