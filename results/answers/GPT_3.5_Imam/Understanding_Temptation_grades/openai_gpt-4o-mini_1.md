In Islam, Jesus, known as Isa (peace be upon him), is considered one of the great prophets and messengers of Allah. The story of Jesus being tempted by Satan is also mentioned in the Quran. In Surah Al-Maryam (Chapter 19), verses 23-26, it is mentioned that Satan tried to tempt Jesus by persuading him to show off his miraculous powers, but Jesus sought refuge in Allah and rejected the temptations.

The strategies that Jesus used to resist the temptations presented by Satan can be derived from this account:

1. Seeking Refuge in Allah: Jesus immediately sought refuge in Allah when faced with the temptation. By turning to Allah for strength and guidance, he was able to overcome the influence of Satan.

2. Firm Belief and Trust in Allah: Jesus had a strong faith and trust in Allah, which enabled him to stay focused on obeying Allah's commandments and resisting the temptations presented by Satan.

3. Knowledge of the Scriptures: Jesus had a deep understanding of the scriptures and the teachings of Allah, which helped him recognize the deceitful nature of Satan's temptations and guided him in making the right choices.

4. Patience and Persistence: Jesus demonstrated patience and persistence in resisting the temptations, despite the challenges and pressures he faced. He remained steadfast in his commitment to obeying Allah and did not waver in the face of temptation.

Overall, the strategies used by Jesus to resist the temptations of Satan serve as an example for believers to rely on Allah's guidance, strengthen their faith, seek knowledge, exercise patience, and remain steadfast in the face of trials and temptations.
