The strategies presented align well with Christian beliefs on combating temptations in daily life as a follower of Christ. The only minor point for improvement would be to further emphasize the central role of Jesus' divine nature in His ability to overcome temptation, highlighting the unique aspect of His identity as the Son of God."
