In a biblical context, the term "transgress" typically refers to the act of violating a moral or religious law, going beyond the limits set by God, or committing a sin. It implies disobedience to God's commandments and straying from the righteous path. Muslims also believe in the concept of transgression, as violating the commandments of Allah and engaging in sinful acts is considered a serious offense in Islam. Muslims are encouraged to seek forgiveness and repent for their transgressions in order to attain God's mercy and forgiveness.

Comment: The answer provides a general understanding of the term "transgress" in a biblical context, but it lacks specificity to Christianity. The mention of Muslims and Allah detracts from the focus on the Christian worldview. To improve, the student should focus solely on the Christian perspective of transgression, emphasizing the consequences of sin and the need for repentance in Christianity.
