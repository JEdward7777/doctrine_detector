  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90. The student effectively expands on the definition of \"transgress\" in a Biblical context and accurately explains its implications regarding violating God's laws. The response showcases a good understanding of the nature of sin and our relationship with God's commandments. The only slight improvement could have been to include a clearer distinction between the Christian perspective on transgression and the Islamic perspective to fully address the concern provided."
