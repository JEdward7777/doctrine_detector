However, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives on sin is not relevant to the question posed, which specifically asked for an explanation within a Christian worldview. The response would have been stronger if it focused solely on Christian teachings and doctrines. Additionally, more theological depth and scriptural references could have strengthened the argument."
