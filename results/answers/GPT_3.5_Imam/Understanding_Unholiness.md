In Islam, an "unholy" life can be characterized by persisting in sinful behavior, neglecting acts of worship, engaging in dishonesty or cheating, harming others, being arrogant or selfish, and overall straying away from the teachings of Islam.

Some signs that may indicate living an unholy life include:

1. Ignoring obligatory acts of worship such as praying, fasting, giving charity, and performing Hajj if financially and physically able.
2. Engaging in prohibited actions such as consuming alcohol, engaging in illegal activities, or engaging in immoral behavior.
3. Lacking sincerity in intentions and actions, and performing deeds for show-off or personal gain.
4. Neglecting the rights of others, such as family members, neighbors, or the community.
5. Being ungrateful for the blessings of Allah and not recognizing His mercy and guidance in one's life.
6. Having a negative or harmful influence on others by promoting sinful behavior or leading them away from the path of righteousness.

To identify these characteristics in our actions or society, it is essential to regularly self-reflect, seek knowledge and guidance from Islamic sources, consult with knowledgeable individuals such as scholars or elders, and strive to improve ourselves through sincere repentance and seeking forgiveness from Allah. Additionally, being mindful of how our actions impact those around us and society as a whole can help us avoid falling into the trap of living an unholy life.
