  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 70. \n\nThe answer provides a thorough explanation of characteristics of an \"unholy\" life in Islam and offers clear signs to identify such behavior in actions or society. The connection to self-reflection, seeking guidance, and improving oneself through repentance and forgiveness is well-stated. However, the response lacks specific references to Islamic scriptures or teachings to support the points made, which would strengthen the doctrinal correctness of the answer. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the consequences of living an unholy life in Islam could enhance the depth of the response."
