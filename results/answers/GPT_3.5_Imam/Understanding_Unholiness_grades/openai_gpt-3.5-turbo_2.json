It aligns well with the Christian concern of self-examination and awareness of how unholiness can impact both personal and communal behavior. The suggestions for self-reflection, seeking guidance from Islamic sources, and considering the influence on others demonstrate a commitment to personal growth and accountability in the context of a Christian worldview."
