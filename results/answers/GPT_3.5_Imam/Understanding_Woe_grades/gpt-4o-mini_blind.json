  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 40/100.\n\nWhile the student attempted to provide an explanation of the term \"woe\" in a religious context, the response inaccurately focused on Islamic teachings rather than addressing the specific question about biblical warnings and judgments. The student should have focused on Christian teachings and scriptures to accurately explain the significance of \"woe\" in that context. Additionally, the mention of \"peace be upon him\" in reference to Prophet Muhammad is not applicable in a Christian-specific worldview. There is also a lack of depth in the explanation regarding the implications of \"woe\" within the Christian faith. The answer would greatly benefit from more direct references to Christian scriptures and teachings to solidify its relevance."
