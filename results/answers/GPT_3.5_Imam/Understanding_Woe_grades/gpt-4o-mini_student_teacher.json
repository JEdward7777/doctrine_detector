  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Since the student's answer focused on Islamic teachings rather than a Christian worldview, the grade for this response would be 40. The student provided a detailed explanation of the term \"woe\" in Islamic teachings, which is informative, but the answer did not address the concern of understanding biblical warnings related to sin and judgment from a Christian perspective. A more relevant response would have directly referenced biblical scriptures and teachings."
