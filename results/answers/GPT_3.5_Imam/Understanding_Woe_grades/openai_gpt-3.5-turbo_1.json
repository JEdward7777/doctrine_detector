  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation from an Islamic perspective on the concept of \"woe\" in relation to sin and punishment. However, the concern was to evaluate the answer from a Christian worldview, so the grade is lower as the response did not address biblical warnings specifically. A higher grade could have been achieved by relating the concept of \"woe\" to biblical teachings on sin, judgment, and repentance in Christianity."
