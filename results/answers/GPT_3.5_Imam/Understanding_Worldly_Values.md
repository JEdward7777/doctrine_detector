## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that I am providing information from an Islamic perspective, not a Christian one. However, I can speak about the concept of being "worldly" from an Islamic viewpoint.

In Islam, being "worldly" is often associated with focusing excessively on material possessions, wealth, status, and indulging in worldly pleasures at the expense of neglecting one's spiritual growth and connection with Allah.

It is important for Muslims to strike a balance between their worldly commitments and their spiritual obligations. The Qur'an warns against being too attached to the fleeting pleasures of this world and emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the Hereafter. Muslims are encouraged to seek sustenance and success in their worldly pursuits, but not at the expense of their faith and moral values.

Ultimately, Islam teaches that true success lies in maintaining a strong connection with Allah, living a life of righteousness, showing compassion to others, and working towards the betterment of society. Being "worldly" in the Islamic context is therefore understood as being focused on worldly matters to the extent that it distracts one from their spiritual journey and moral principles.
