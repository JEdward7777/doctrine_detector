However, it does not fully align with the Christian specific worldview as referenced in the concern. The student's definition of \"worldly\" primarily draws on Islamic teachings and concepts, rather than Christian doctrines. While the underlying principles of prioritizing spiritual values over material possessions may have similarities across religions, the specific terminology and contexts may differ."
