  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does address the concern of understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, but it doesn't directly engage with the Christian perspective provided as the answer. Instead, it provides an Islamic viewpoint on the concept of being \"worldly\". While this is not entirely irrelevant to the concern, it is not a direct response to the question.\n\nThe response does provide some insightful points about the Islamic understanding of being \"worldly\" and how it can distract from one's spiritual growth and moral principles. It also mentions the importance of prioritizing the Hereafter and seeking sustenance in this world while maintaining faith and moral values. These points do highlight the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, even if they are framed within an Islamic context.\n\nTo receive a higher score, the response could have directly engaged with the Christian answer by providing a more explicit comparison or contrast between the two perspectives on what it means to be \"worldly\"."
