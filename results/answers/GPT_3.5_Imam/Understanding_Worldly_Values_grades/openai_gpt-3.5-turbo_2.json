The Imam effectively conveys the Islamic viewpoint on the matter and provides insight into how Muslims should approach worldly matters while prioritizing their faith. The response could have further emphasized the contrast between worldly values such as selfishness and corruption, and godly principles, in order to address the Christian concern more directly. Overall, the perspective offered aligns well with Islamic teachings and provides valuable insight into the concept of being \"worldly\" within an Islamic framework."
