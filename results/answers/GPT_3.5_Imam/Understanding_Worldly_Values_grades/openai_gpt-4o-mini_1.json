The discussion is clear and insightful, showing how being \"worldly\" in Islam relates to focusing too much on material possessions and worldly pleasures at the expense of spiritual growth and connection with Allah. The response effectively conveys the importance of balancing worldly commitments with spiritual obligations and emphasizes the significance of prioritizing the Hereafter. The tie-in to seeking sustenance and success in worldly pursuits without compromising faith and moral values aligns well with Christian teachings on worldly vs. godly values."
