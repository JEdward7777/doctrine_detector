While the response does not directly address the concern from a Christian perspective, the understanding of worship as a means to strengthen connection, seek pleasure, and fulfill purpose aligns with the idea of worship in Christianity as well. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly drawing parallels between Islamic and Christian perspectives on worship."
