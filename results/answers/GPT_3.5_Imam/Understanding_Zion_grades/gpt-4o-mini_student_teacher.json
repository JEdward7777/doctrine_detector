  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 85.\n\nThe student provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel, demonstrating an understanding of the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people. The student effectively discusses the symbolic and poetic nature of the term, its historical and spiritual significance, and its representation of the special relationship between the people of Israel and the land of Zion.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning God's affection and care for the people of Israel, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Emphasizing this aspect would further align the student's response with a Christian specific worldview."
