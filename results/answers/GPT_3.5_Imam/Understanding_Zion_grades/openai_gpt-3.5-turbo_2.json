  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" as a symbolic and poetic expression in the Hebrew Bible, emphasizing the special relationship between the people of Israel and Jerusalem. It appropriately addresses the concern by discussing the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a direct reference to God's affection and care for His people in the explanation."
