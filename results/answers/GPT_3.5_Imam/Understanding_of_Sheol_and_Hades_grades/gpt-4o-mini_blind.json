  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student provided a well-written explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding the afterlife of the righteous and unrighteous. However, the response does not directly address the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the context of the Bible. To improve the grade, the student should have attempted to compare and contrast Sheol and Hades with Islamic beliefs about the afterlife, even if they are not directly analogous. The response could have been strengthened by acknowledging the differences between Christian and Islamic perspectives on the afterlife in a more explicit manner."
