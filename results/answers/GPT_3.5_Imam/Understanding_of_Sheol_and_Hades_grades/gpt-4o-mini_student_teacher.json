  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and informative about Islamic beliefs regarding the afterlife for the righteous and unrighteous. However, the answer does not directly address the biblical concepts of Sheol and Hades and how they differ in the context of the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on the specific biblical concepts mentioned in the question and provide a comparison with Islamic beliefs, if relevant."
