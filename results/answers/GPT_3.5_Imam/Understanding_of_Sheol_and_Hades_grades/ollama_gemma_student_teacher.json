  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the afterlife concepts in Islamic belief, but it does not address the specific biblical context of Sheol and Hades as requested in the question. The response correctly explains the Islamic belief in paradise and hell for the righteous and unrighteous respectively, but it does not delve into the nuances of the Sheol and Hades distinction as it relates to the biblical context."
