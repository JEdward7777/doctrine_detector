It effectively contrasts the Christian concept of Sheol/Hades with the Islamic views on Paradise (Jannah) and Hellfire (Jahannam). The distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous is well-addressed from an Islamic perspective. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern raised."
