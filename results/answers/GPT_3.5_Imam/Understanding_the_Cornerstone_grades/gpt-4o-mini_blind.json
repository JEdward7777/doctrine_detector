The doctrinal correctness is lacking as the answer does not accurately reflect the belief that Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of the Christian faith. The focus on Islamic beliefs about Jesus, rather than the biblical perspective, weakens the overall accuracy and theological depth of the response. A Christian-specific viewpoint on the significance of Jesus Christ as the cornerstone in the Assembly of believers was missing from the answer."
