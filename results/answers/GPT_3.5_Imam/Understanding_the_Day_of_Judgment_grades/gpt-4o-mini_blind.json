  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-written explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding Jesus as a judge on the Day of Judgment, the answer did not address the significance of Jesus Christ being appointed as the judge within a Christian worldview. The grading criterion specifically asked for a Christian perspective, so the answer lacks doctrinal correctness in this context. Additionally, it would be helpful for the student to differentiate between Islamic beliefs and Christian beliefs when discussing theological concepts."
