In Islam, Jesus Christ (Isa ibn Maryam) holds a special status as a prophet and messenger of Allah. According to Islamic beliefs, Jesus will reappear before the Day of Judgment as a just ruler and will play a significant role in establishing peace and justice on earth.

Regarding Jesus being appointed as the judge on the Day of Judgment, it is mentioned in the Quran that Allah will appoint him to judge with justice among the followers of Christ. This appointment signifies the special role and status of Jesus in the eyes of Allah on that significant day.

The concept of Jesus being a judge on the Day of Judgment emphasizes the importance of justice and fairness in the final reckoning of all individuals. It also highlights the mercy and wisdom of Allah in choosing honorable and righteous individuals to carry out important tasks on that Day. Muslims believe in the ultimate justice of Allah, and Jesus being appointed as a judge adds to the overall understanding of divine mercy and wisdom in the Islamic worldview.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 65

Comment: While the student provided a well-written explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding Jesus as a judge on the Day of Judgment, the answer did not address the significance of Jesus Christ being appointed as the judge within a Christian worldview. The grading criterion specifically asked for a Christian perspective, so the answer lacks doctrinal correctness in this context. Additionally, it would be helpful for the student to differentiate between Islamic beliefs and Christian beliefs when discussing theological concepts.
