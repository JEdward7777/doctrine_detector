However, from a Christian perspective, the answer does not align with the specific belief that Jesus Christ, being sinless and divine, will judge people based on their lives and relationship with Him. The answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview and the interpretation of Jesus as the ultimate judge in Christianity."
