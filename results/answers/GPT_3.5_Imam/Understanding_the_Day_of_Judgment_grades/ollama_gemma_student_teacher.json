  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on Jesus Christ's role as judge on the Day of Judgment. It accurately summarizes the Quranic belief in Jesus' appointment as a just ruler and emphasizes the importance of justice and fairness in the final reckoning. The student's knowledge of Islamic beliefs is impressive and their articulation is clear and concise. However, the answer does not address the Christian specific worldview as instructed in the prompt."
