  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated explanation of the differences between the Christian concept of the \"elect\" and the Islamic understanding of predestination. However, the response lacks a direct engagement with the Christian perspective on being chosen by God and the significance of this in one's faith journey, which was the specific concern raised. The student's answer would benefit from further addressing the Christian viewpoint on the concept of the 'elect' as set apart for holiness and bearing good spiritual fruit."
