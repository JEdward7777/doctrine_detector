  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of the \"elect\" in both Christian and Islamic theology. They clearly articulate the differences between the two perspectives and avoid making any biased or offensive claims. The response is well-written and respectful of both faiths. However, it could benefit from further elaboration on the specific biblical passages or Islamic sources that support the concepts of predestination and free will."
