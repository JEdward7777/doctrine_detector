  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the term \"house of God\" in the biblical context, accurately highlighting its significance in both the Old and New Testaments. The inclusion of the concept of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit and the church as the body of Christ was well done. However, to improve the grade, the student could further elaborate on the theological significance and spiritual implications of believers being considered the house of God in the New Testament, tying it back to the Old Testament teachings."
