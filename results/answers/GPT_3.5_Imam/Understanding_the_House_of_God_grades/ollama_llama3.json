  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe response accurately defines the term \"house of God\" within the biblical context, correctly referencing both the Old Testament temple and the New Testament concept of the church as the body of Christ. The explanation is clear and concise, effectively communicating the significance and meaning of the term in Scripture. The writer also provides a good overview of how the concept evolves from the Old to the New Testament.\n\nHowever, I deduct 10 points because the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its exploration of the biblical context. While the writer mentions that the temple was seen as a holy and sacred place where God's presence dwelled among His people, they do not provide specific examples or verses to support this claim. Additionally, the response does not delve deeper into the implications of the term \"house of God\" for contemporary Christian life and worship.\n\nOverall, while the response is well-organized and easy to follow, it could benefit from more biblical support and depth in its analysis."
