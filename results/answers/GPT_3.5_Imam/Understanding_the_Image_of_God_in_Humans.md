## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I would like to clarify that in Islamic belief, humans are created in the best of forms (Quran 95:4) and have been honored by Allah as the best of His creation (Quran 17:70). While the concept of the image of God is not specifically mentioned in the Quran, there are qualities and characteristics that Muslims believe reflect the divine attributes bestowed by Allah upon humanity.

Some of the qualities that reflect the image of God or divine attributes include:

1. **Intellect**: Humans have been endowed with rational thinking and intellect to distinguish between right and wrong, to seek knowledge, and to utilize their reasoning abilities to make moral choices.

2. **Free Will**: Humans have the ability to choose between good and evil, to make conscious decisions, and to be responsible for their actions. This free will reflects the divine attribute of Al-Hakim (The Wise).

3. **Compassion and Mercy**: Just as Allah is the Most Merciful and Compassionate, humans are encouraged to show kindness, empathy, and mercy towards others. These qualities reflect the divine attribute of Ar-Rahman (The Most Gracious) and Ar-Rahim (The Most Merciful).

4. **Love and Forgiveness**: Muslims believe in the importance of love, forgiveness, and tolerance towards others, which reflect the divine attribute of Al-Ghafoor (The All-Forgiving) and Al-Wadud (The Loving).

5. **Creativity**: Humans have been granted the ability to create, innovate, and appreciate beauty in the world, which reflects the divine attribute of Al-Bari (The Creator).

6. **Justice**: Muslims are taught to uphold justice, fairness, and equality, which reflect the divine attribute of Al-Adl (The Just).

It is important to note that while humans possess qualities that reflect divine attributes, they are limited and imperfect compared to the infinite and perfect attributes of Allah. Therefore, it is essential for Muslims to strive to develop these qualities as a means of emulating the divine attributes and fulfilling their purpose as vicegerents on earth (Quran 2:30).
