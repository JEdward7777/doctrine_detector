  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. \n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation from an Islamic perspective on the qualities that reflect divine attributes bestowed by Allah upon humanity, they did not directly address the biblical definition of what characteristics reflect the image of God as requested in the question. Since the concern is to deepen understanding of what it means to be created in the image of God according to the biblical definition, the student's response, while insightful and relevant to Islamic beliefs, deviated from the specific focus of the question. \n\nTherefore, the grade reflects the thoroughness and thoughtfulness of the response within the context of Islamic beliefs, but also takes into account the deviation from the specific focus on the biblical definition of the image of God."
