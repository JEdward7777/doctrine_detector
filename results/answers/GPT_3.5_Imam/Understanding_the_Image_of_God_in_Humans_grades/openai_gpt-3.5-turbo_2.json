The inclusion of scriptural references, explanation of qualities, and the emphasis on the imperfection of human qualities compared to Allah's attributes showcases a deep understanding of the concept. The response effectively addresses the concern by delving into the significance of reflecting divine attributes beyond just the mentioned characteristics."
