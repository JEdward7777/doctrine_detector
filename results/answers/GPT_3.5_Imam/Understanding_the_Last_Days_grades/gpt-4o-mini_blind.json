However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to note that Islamic beliefs about Jesus fundamentally diverge from Christian teachings. The Christian understanding of the 'last days' in relation to Jesus' first coming involves his incarnation, ministry, death on the cross for the redemption of humanity, and resurrection. His second coming is anticipated as the glorious return of the resurrected Christ in power and glory to judge the living and the dead. The response accurately reflects Islamic beliefs, but it does not address the Christian perspective on this topic."
