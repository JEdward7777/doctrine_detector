  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer, while informative about Islamic beliefs regarding the concept of the 'last days,' completely misses the Christian perspective requested in the question. The answer provided lacks relevance to the timeline of major Biblical events related to Jesus' first and second comings as well as their implications for Christian faith. The focus on Islamic beliefs instead of addressing the Christian worldview makes this response inadequate."
