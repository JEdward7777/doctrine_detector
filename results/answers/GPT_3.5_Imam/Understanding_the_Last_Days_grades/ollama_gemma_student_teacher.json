However, it lacks relevant information from a Christian worldview. The answer correctly explains the significance of the 'last days' in Islamic teachings, but it does not address the Christian perspective on the subject. The student could have elaborated on the Christian understanding of the 'last days' in relation to Jesus' first and second comings, which is the focus of the question."
