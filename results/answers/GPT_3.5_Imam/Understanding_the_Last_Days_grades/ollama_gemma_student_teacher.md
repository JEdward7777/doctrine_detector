## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Last_Days.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the concept of the 'last days' refers to the period before the Day of Judgment when the world will come to an end and all individuals will be resurrected and held accountable for their actions. 

Regarding Jesus' first coming, Muslims believe that he was a prophet and messenger of God who preached monotheism and righteousness to the Israelites. Muslims do not believe in the concept of Jesus as the son of God or that he died on the cross. Instead, it is believed that Jesus was raised alive to the heavens by God.

Concerning his second coming, Muslims also believe in the return of Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) as a sign of the Day of Judgment. It is believed that during his return, Jesus will play a significant role in establishing justice and peace on Earth and will defeat the false messiah (Dajjal). This event is considered a prelude to the final hour and the Day of Resurrection.

In summary, the 'last days' in relation to Jesus' first and second comings hold significant spiritual and eschatological importance in Islamic teachings, emphasizing the beliefs in the final judgment, resurrection, and the return of Jesus as a sign of the end times.

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of the 'last days' within Islamic beliefs. However, it lacks relevant information from a Christian worldview. The answer correctly explains the significance of the 'last days' in Islamic teachings, but it does not address the Christian perspective on the subject. The student could have elaborated on the Christian understanding of the 'last days' in relation to Jesus' first and second comings, which is the focus of the question.
