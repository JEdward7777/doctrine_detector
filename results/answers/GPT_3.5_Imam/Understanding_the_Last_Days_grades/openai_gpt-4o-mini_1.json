However, from a Christian perspective, the concern is that the response does not align with the timeline of major Biblical events as central to Christian faith. It is crucial in a Christian worldview to emphasize the unique significance of Jesus as the Son of God, His death on the cross for the atonement of sins, and the implications for Christian faith in understanding the 'last days'."
