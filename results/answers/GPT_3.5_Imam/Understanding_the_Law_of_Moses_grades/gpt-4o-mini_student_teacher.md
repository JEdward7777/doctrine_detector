Some of the specific commandments included in the Law of Moses that God gave for the Israelites to obey are known as the Ten Commandments. These commandments are found in the Torah, specifically in the book of Exodus 20:2-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21. They are as follows:

1. You shall have no other gods before Me.
2. You shall not make for yourself an idol.
3. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.
4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
5. Honor your father and your mother.
6. You shall not murder.
7. You shall not commit adultery.
8. You shall not steal.
9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
10. You shall not covet.

These commandments were given to the Israelites as a moral and ethical code to guide their behavior and interactions with God and each other.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student has provided a fairly good understanding of the specific commandments included in the Law of Moses, focusing on the Ten Commandments. The answer demonstrates knowledge of key commandments and their significance in guiding behavior. However, the response lacks depth in discussing the broader range of laws within the Law of Moses beyond just the Ten Commandments, which would have shown a deeper understanding of the Old Testament laws and their relevance today.
