  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed explanation of the significance of the name \"Yahweh\" in the context of the Old Testament, touching on its derivation and the reverence it holds in Jewish tradition. However, the answer strayed off the main focus by discussing Islamic beliefs, which was not directly relevant to the question. Encouraging the student to stay more focused on the specifics of the Christian understanding would improve the grade."
