The explanation is thorough, supported by relevant examples, and demonstrates a clear understanding of how the Old Testament foreshadows the work of Jesus Christ in providing ultimate deliverance from sin. The response also integrates Christian worldview principles effectively in discussing divine appointment, deliverance, leadership, justice, and mercy."
