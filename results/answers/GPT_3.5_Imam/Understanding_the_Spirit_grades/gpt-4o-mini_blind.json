  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComments: The student's answer does not align with a Christian perspective as requested. The answer predominantly discusses Islamic beliefs regarding human spirits and evil spirits, which is not relevant to the question about the differentiation between the human spirit and evil spirit in the Bible. Additionally, the explanation provided is not based on biblical teachings, making it inaccurate from a Christian worldview. The response lacks a foundational understanding of the concepts of human spirit and evil spirit as presented in the Bible."
