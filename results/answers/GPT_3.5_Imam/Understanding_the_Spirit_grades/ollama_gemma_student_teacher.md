## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Spirit.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
From an Islamic perspective, the differentiation between the human spirit (ruh) and evil spirits is not explicitly addressed in the Bible, as the primary sources of Islamic teachings are the Quran and the Hadith.

In Islam, the human spirit is considered a divine creation which is breathed into each individual by Allah. It is what gives life to the physical body and distinguishes humans from other creations. The human spirit is viewed as pure and has the potential for goodness, guidance, and connection to the divine.

On the other hand, evil spirits are believed to be creations of Allah known as Jinn. In Islamic theology, Jinn are unseen beings created from smokeless fire, and they have free will like humans. Some Jinn may choose to follow a path of disobedience and evil, and these are the ones referred to as evil spirits or demons. They may try to influence humans towards negative behaviors and actions.

It is important in Islam to seek protection from evil spirits by seeking refuge in Allah and following the guidance provided in the Quran and Hadith. Consistent prayers, seeking knowledge, and performing good deeds are ways to protect oneself from negative influences, including evil spirits.
