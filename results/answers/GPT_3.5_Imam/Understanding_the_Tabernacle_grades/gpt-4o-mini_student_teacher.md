Grade: 40

Comment: The student's answer mentions Allah instead of God, which is not aligned with the Christian worldview. Additionally, the response lacks specificity about following the detailed instructions given by God for the construction of the tabernacle, which was a key aspect of its purpose in facilitating the Israelites' relationship with God. The student should focus on accurately reflecting biblical teachings and terminology related to the Israelites' worship of God through the tabernacle.
