However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies and lacking depth in the Christian interpretation. The Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of Man also encompasses his divine nature, not just his humanity. Additionally, the response could benefit from more depth and clarity in explaining the theological nuances of this title within Christianity."
