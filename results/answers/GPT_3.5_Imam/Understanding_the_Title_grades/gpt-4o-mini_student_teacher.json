The answer also strays into discussing Islamic interpretations, which although informative, is not directly relevant to the concern at hand. It lacks depth in analyzing the implications of Jesus' self-identification as 'Son of Man' for our faith from a Christian perspective. Further development and focus on the Christian understanding would have improved the response."
