## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Title.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the context of Jesus' identity, the title 'Son of Man' carries deep significance. It is mentioned in the Gospels of the Bible as a title that Jesus used to refer to himself. 

The term 'Son of Man' has different interpretations among scholars and theologians. In a Christian context, it is often understood as emphasizing Jesus' humanity, highlighting his role as a divine figure who came to Earth in human form to carry out God's plan for salvation.

In Islamic tradition, Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) is considered a human prophet and servant of Allah, rather than divine or the literal son of God. Muslims believe in his miraculous birth to the Virgin Mary, and that he performed miracles by the will of Allah. 

The title 'Son of Man' in Islamic perspective could be seen as emphasizing Jesus' humanness and his role as a messenger of God among the many prophets sent to guide humanity. It is a reminder of Jesus' humility and his role as a servant of God, rather than a claim of divinity.
