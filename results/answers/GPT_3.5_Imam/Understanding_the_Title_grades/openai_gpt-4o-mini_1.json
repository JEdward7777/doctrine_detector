  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 80.\n\nThe response effectively acknowledges the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine through the title 'Son of Man' and connects it to His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity. It also touches upon the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' and its implications for our faith.\n\nHowever, the response could have delved deeper into the theological and soteriological implications of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' within Christian belief, such as how it relates to His role as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sin and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. Adding these aspects would have strengthened the response further."
