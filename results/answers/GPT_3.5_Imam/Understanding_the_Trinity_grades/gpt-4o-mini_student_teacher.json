  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written and respectful comparison between Islamic beliefs regarding the oneness of God and the Christian belief in the Trinity. However, the student did not directly address the complexity of how God can exist as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit while being one God, as indicated in the question. A stronger response would have delved deeper into the theological understanding of the Trinity within Christianity and the concept of Tawhid in Islam."
