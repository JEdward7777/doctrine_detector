2. Worshiping idols: The Israelites were known to worship idols and statues, despite the clear prohibition of idol worship in Islam.

3. Hypocrisy in worship: The Israelites were known to outwardly appear as devout worshippers while internally harboring disbelief or ill intentions. This hypocrisy in worship is condemned in Islam.

Comments: The answer provided is inaccurate and misleading from a Christian perspective. The mention of the Quran and Hadith in relation to the people of Israel is incorrect, as these texts are not part of the Christian scriptures. Additionally, the explanation provided emphasizes Islamic beliefs instead of focusing on Christian teachings on the unfaithfulness of the people of Israel in their worship. A more appropriate response would have cited specific instances from the Old Testament where the Israelites worshiped false gods, engaged in idolatry, and strayed from God's commandments. It is crucial to provide answers that align with Christian doctrine when discussing topics related to the people of Israel in a Christian worldview context.
