  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the mark by bringing in references to the Quran and Hadith, which are not relevant to a Christian worldview. Additionally, the answer includes information that is not specific to the people of Israel but rather to Muslims. The student did mention worshiping idols, which aligns with the teacher's reference answer, but the inclusion of irrelevant information and lack of focus on the specific unfaithfulness of the people of Israel in a Christian context lower the grade for this response."
