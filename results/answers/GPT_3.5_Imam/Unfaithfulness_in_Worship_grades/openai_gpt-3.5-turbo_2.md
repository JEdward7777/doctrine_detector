The people of Israel demonstrated unfaithfulness in their worship in several ways, as mentioned in the Quran and Hadith. Some of the common ways include:

1. Associating partners with Allah (shirk): The Israelites were known to associate partners with Allah in their worship, despite being repeatedly reminded of the oneness of Allah and being forbidden from doing so.

2. Worshiping idols: The Israelites were known to worship idols and statues, despite the clear prohibition of idol worship in Islam.

3. Hypocrisy in worship: The Israelites were known to outwardly appear as devout worshippers while internally harboring disbelief or ill intentions. This hypocrisy in worship is condemned in Islam.

4. Neglecting the commandments of Allah: The Israelites were known to neglect or disobey the commandments of Allah, including neglecting their prayers, not giving charity, and engaging in sinful behavior.

Overall, unfaithfulness in worship can take many forms, and it is important for Muslims to remain steadfast in their worship of Allah alone, following His commandments with sincerity and devotion.
