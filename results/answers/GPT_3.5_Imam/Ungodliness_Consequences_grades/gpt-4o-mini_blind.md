In Islam, the consequences for ungodly behavior are numerous and are outlined in the Quran and Hadith. Some of the consequences for ungodly people include:

1. Punishment in the Hereafter: The Quran describes various punishments in the Hereafter for those who engage in ungodly behavior. These may include the Hellfire, which is described as a place of torment and suffering for those who reject the guidance of Allah.

2. Loss of blessings: Engaging in ungodly behavior can lead to a loss of blessings and prosperity in this world. Allah may withhold His blessings from those who disobey Him, leading to difficulties and hardships in life.

3. Straying from the right path: Those who continue to engage in ungodly behavior risk straying further from the right path and veering away from the teachings of Islam. This can lead to a spiritual decline and distance from Allah.

4. Hypocrisy and insincerity: Engaging in ungodly behavior can lead to hypocrisy and insincerity in faith. This can have negative consequences on one's relationship with Allah and with other believers.

It is important for Muslims to strive to avoid ungodly behavior and to repent and seek forgiveness if they have engaged in such actions. Allah is merciful and forgiving, and He is always willing to accept the repentance of those who turn to Him sincerely. Muslims are encouraged to seek guidance from the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to lead a righteous and fulfilling life.

Additionally, the answer could have emphasized the importance of sincere repentance and reliance on Allah's mercy for forgiveness. Expanding on these points would have strengthened the answer and provided a more comprehensive understanding from an Islamic perspective.
