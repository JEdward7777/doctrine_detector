  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the consequences of ungodly behavior in Islam, but the focus was not on a Christian-specific worldview. The answer should have addressed the Christian perspective on God's judgment and wrath towards ungodly people who reject Him and His ways. The student should have referenced biblical passages and teachings to support their answer."
