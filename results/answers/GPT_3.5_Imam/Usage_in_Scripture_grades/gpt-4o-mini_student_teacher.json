  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation regarding the usage of the term 'Holy One' in both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the divine nature and purity associated with this title. However, the student missed the specific connection between the term 'Holy One' in the New Testament as a reference to Jesus. It is crucial to explicitly highlight this point as it directly relates to exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament. Overall, a solid response, but a more direct connection to Jesus as the 'Holy One' in the New Testament would have strengthened the answer."
