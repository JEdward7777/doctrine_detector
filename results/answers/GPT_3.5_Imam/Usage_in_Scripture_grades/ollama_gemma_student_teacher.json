  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the usage of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments. It correctly identifies the contexts in which the term is used and explains its significance in highlighting the purity and righteousness of both God and Jesus Christ. The response is well-written and demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical text. However, it would benefit from additional citations from the Old and New Testaments to support the claims made."
