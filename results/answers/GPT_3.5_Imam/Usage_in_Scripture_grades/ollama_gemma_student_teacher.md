## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In the Old Testament, the term 'Holy One' is used to refer to God Himself, emphasizing His holiness and purity. For example, in the book of Isaiah, God is often referred to as the "Holy One of Israel" (Isaiah 1:4, Isaiah 5:16, Isaiah 10:20). This term highlights God's uniqueness and perfect righteousness.

In the New Testament, the term 'Holy One' is used in connection with Jesus Christ. In the Gospel of Luke, the angel Gabriel refers to Jesus as the "Holy One" when announcing His birth to Mary: "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God" (Luke 1:35). This title emphasizes Jesus' sinlessness and divine nature.

Overall, the term 'Holy One' is used in both the Old and New Testaments to highlight the purity, righteousness, and divine nature of God and Jesus Christ.
