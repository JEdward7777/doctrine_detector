The connection between Jesus being referred to as the 'Holy One' in the New Testament and his sinlessness and divine nature is well-explained. The response could be enhanced by delving deeper into specific passages that explicitly showcase the authority and divinity of Jesus in the New Testament. Overall, a solid understanding and application of a Christian worldview in discussing the term 'Holy One.'"
