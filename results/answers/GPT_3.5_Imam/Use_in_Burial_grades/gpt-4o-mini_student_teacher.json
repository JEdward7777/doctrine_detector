  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer an 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of how myrrh was used in burial practices in biblical times and cited relevant examples from the Bible, they included additional information beyond the provided reference answer. The student accurately described myrrh as a perfume and anointing oil for the deceased, its significance in honoring and preserving the body, its cleansing and healing properties, and its symbolism of respect and preparation for the afterlife. However, the student's response could have been further enhanced by directly addressing the concern about the importance of recognizing burial customs to understand cultural contexts in scripture, which the reference answer succinctly captured. Additionally, the student's answer included more historical and scriptural details than what was required by the reference answer, making it slightly more elaborate than necessary."
