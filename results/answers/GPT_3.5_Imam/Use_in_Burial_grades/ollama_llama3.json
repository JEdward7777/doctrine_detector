  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by recognizing the customs surrounding burial practices in biblical times, specifically highlighting the use of myrrh as a symbol of respect and honor for the deceased. The information provided is accurate and relevant to the original answer, which also emphasizes the importance of myrrh in anointing and preparing bodies for burial.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more specific examples from scripture, such as the mention of myrrh in the Gospel of John or Book of Esther, as was done in the original passage. Additionally, while the response mentions the cleansing and healing properties of myrrh, it could delve deeper into the cultural significance of these properties in biblical times.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the customs surrounding burial practices in biblical times and their relevance to scripture."
