  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The response provides information on how John the Baptist and Jesus are viewed in Islam, which is informative but not directly relevant to the question at hand. The answer lacks specific information regarding how John the Baptist and Jesus were referred to concerning the title \"Rabbi\" within a Christian context. There is some confusion in the answer, as it mixes Islamic beliefs with Christian titles and roles, which could potentially lead to misunderstanding or misrepresentation. To improve the grade, the student should focus on addressing the question from a Christian perspective and providing accurate information on the use of the title \"Rabbi\" in relation to John the Baptist and Jesus within Christianity."
