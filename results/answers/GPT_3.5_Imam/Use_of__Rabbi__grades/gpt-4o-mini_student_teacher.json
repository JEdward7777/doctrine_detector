  "grade": 25.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 25. \n\nWhile the student did provide information about the respect and honor given to John the Baptist and Jesus in Islam, the response did not adequately address the specific concern about recognizing the respect and authority associated with their teachings in a Christian context. The student also did not directly answer how John the Baptist and Jesus were referred to concerning the title 'Rabbi.' Instead, they focused more on their roles as prophets in Islam.\n\nThe student did make an attempt to connect the concept of teacher or master with the title \"Rabbi,\" but the lack of specific information about John and Jesus being called Rabbi by their disciples indicated a limited understanding of the Christian context. Additionally, the explanation about Jesus being referred to as Isa al-Masih in Islam was not directly relevant to the question.\n\nOverall, the answer lacked a thorough analysis of the Christian perspective on the respect and authority associated with the teachings of John the Baptist and Jesus, leading to a lower grade."
