However, it does not fully address the specific concern regarding the title \"Rabbi\" as it primarily discusses Islamic traditions rather than Christian beliefs. The response could benefit from additional evidence from Christian sources to support the claim that John and Jesus were sometimes called \"Rabbi\" by their disciples."
