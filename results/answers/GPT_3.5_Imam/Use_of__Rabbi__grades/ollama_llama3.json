While it correctly notes that both figures are respected in Islam, it does not delve deeper into their teachings or significance within the Islamic tradition. Additionally, the response does not explicitly address the title \"Rabbi\" as requested. However, it does provide some accurate information about Jesus' status as Isa al-Masih and his role as a chosen messenger of God. To improve this response, it would be helpful to more fully explore the teachings and authority of John the Baptist and Jesus within their respective religious traditions, as well as explicitly address the concern of recognizing their respect and authority."
