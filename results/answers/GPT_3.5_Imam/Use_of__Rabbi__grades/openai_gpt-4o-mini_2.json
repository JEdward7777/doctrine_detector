However, while it accurately discusses their roles as esteemed figures, it does not directly address the concern about recognizing the respect and authority associated with their teachings as found in the given answer. A stronger connection between the respect for Jesus and John in Islam and their roles as teachers could have made the response more aligned with the concern provided."
