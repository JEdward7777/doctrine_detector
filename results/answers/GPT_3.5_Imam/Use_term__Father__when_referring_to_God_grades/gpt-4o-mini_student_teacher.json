  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned answer from an Islamic perspective, highlighting the importance of using accurate language to describe God in Islam. However, from a Christian worldview, the concern is that avoiding the term 'Father' could lead to theological inaccuracies and dilute the scriptural message. The student's response does not address this specific concern raised in the reference answer, which is why the grade is lower. Further exploration of how different religious traditions approach and interpret the concept of God's identity could enhance the response."
