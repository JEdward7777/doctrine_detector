However, the given answer misses the mark by suggesting that it is necessary to use the term 'Father' and relying on teaching and context to clarify misunderstandings. This approach goes against Islamic theology and could potentially lead to theological inaccuracies and dilution of the scriptural message. The response would benefit from a stronger articulation of the Christian view on the use of the term 'Father' in theological discussions."
