  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful perspective on why the term 'Father' is not commonly used in Islamic theology to refer to God, emphasizing the importance of accurately conveying monotheistic beliefs. However, the concern raised about theological inaccuracies and dilution of the scriptural message is not directly addressed or refuted in the response, leading to a lower grade. The response could be strengthened by providing a more detailed explanation or alternative solution to address potential misunderstandings without compromising Islamic beliefs."
