It effectively connects this shared teaching to the concept of submission to Allah in Islamic teachings. However, the response could have further emphasized the eternal and transformative nature of the Kingdom of God, as well as the personal application of this concept in one's life, in order to address the concern of appreciating the worth and significance of the kingdom of God more fully."
