However, it does not directly address the concern of appreciating the worth and significance of the Kingdom of God in our lives based on a Christian worldview. It would have been stronger if the response explicitly highlighted the unique Christian perspective on the transformative power and immense value of the Kingdom of God as portrayed in the parables of Jesus."
