However, the response could have further emphasized the unique and central role of Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity, which is crucial in fully appreciating the worth and significance of the Kingdom of God. A stronger focus on the divinity of Jesus and His sacrificial death for the salvation of humanity would have enriched the Christian perspective on the Kingdom of God."
