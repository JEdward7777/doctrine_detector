## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the promise of God regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan is clearly mentioned in the Quran. Allah assures us that Satan's plots and temptations will ultimately be in vain, and that he will have no power or authority over the righteous believers.

One of the verses in the Quran that exemplifies this promise can be found in Surah Sad (38:83-85), where Satan declares his enmity towards humanity and Allah responds by saying:

"Indeed, you have no authority over My servants. And sufficient is your Lord as Disposer of affairs." (Quran 17:65)

This verse conveys the message that Satan's influence is limited and temporary, while the power and authority of Allah is absolute and eternal. Ultimately, Satan will be defeated and cast into the Hellfire, along with those who followed his path of disobedience.

As Muslims, we are encouraged to seek refuge in Allah from the whispers and temptations of Satan, and to constantly strive to resist his influence by adhering to the guidance of the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Ultimately, we believe in the ultimate victory of truth and righteousness over falsehood and evil, as promised by Allah in the Quran.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student provided a thorough response from an Islamic perspective regarding the defeat of Satan. However, the answer does not align with a Christian specific worldview as requested. The specific promise regarding the defeat of Satan by one of Eve's descendants, the Messiah, as outlined in the reference answer, is foundational to Christian belief and was not addressed in the student's response.
