  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Islamic perspective on the ultimate defeat of Satan. They accurately reference relevant verses from the Quran to support their claims and provide a clear explanation of Allah's sovereignty and the limited power of Satan. However, the answer does not address the Christian-specific worldview or the promise mentioned in the prompt, which is why it does not receive a higher grade."
