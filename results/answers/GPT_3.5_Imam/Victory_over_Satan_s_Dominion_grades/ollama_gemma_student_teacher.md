## [Answer](../Victory_over_Satan_s_Dominion.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was not crucified, but instead, he was raised up to the heavens by Allah. The Quran states in Surah An-Nisa (4:157-158): "And [for] their saying, 'Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.' And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise."

Therefore, in the Islamic belief, there is no significance of Jesus' death on the cross regarding Satan's dominion because he was not crucified in the first place. Allah protected Jesus from the harms of his enemies and raised him up to the heavens.
