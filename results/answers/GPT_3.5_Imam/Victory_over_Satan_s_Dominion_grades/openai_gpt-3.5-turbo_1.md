## [Answer](../Victory_over_Satan_s_Dominion.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was not crucified, but instead, he was raised up to the heavens by Allah. The Quran states in Surah An-Nisa (4:157-158): "And [for] their saying, 'Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.' And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise."

Therefore, in the Islamic belief, there is no significance of Jesus' death on the cross regarding Satan's dominion because he was not crucified in the first place. Allah protected Jesus from the harms of his enemies and raised him up to the heavens.

Comment: The response provided, while accurately representing the Islamic belief regarding Jesus' crucifixion, does not address the Christian perspective on Christ's victory over sin and evil through His death on the cross. It lacks a Christian-specific worldview in understanding the implications of Christ's victory for believers and how it influences one's spiritual life. It is essential to consider and incorporate Christian teachings in order to fully address the concern provided.
