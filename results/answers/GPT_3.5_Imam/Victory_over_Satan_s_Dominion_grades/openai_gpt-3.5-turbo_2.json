From a Christian worldview, the belief in Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross is foundational to the victory over sin and evil, offering redemption and salvation to humanity. The response does not engage with the concern raised about understanding the implications of Christ's victory for believers and their spiritual life from a Christian perspective."
