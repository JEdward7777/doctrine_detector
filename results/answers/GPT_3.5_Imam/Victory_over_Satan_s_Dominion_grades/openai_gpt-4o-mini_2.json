However, from a Christian worldview, the significance of Jesus' death on the cross goes beyond the defeat of Satan's dominion. It is central to the Christian faith as it represents the atonement for the sins of humanity and the reconciliation between God and mankind. Understanding and accepting the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross is crucial for believers as it forms the foundation of their faith and shapes their spiritual life."
