## [Answer](../Victory_over_Satan_s_Dominion.md) by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was not crucified, but instead, he was raised up to the heavens by Allah. The Quran states in Surah An-Nisa (4:157-158): "And [for] their saying, 'Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.' And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise."

Therefore, in the Islamic belief, there is no significance of Jesus' death on the cross regarding Satan's dominion because he was not crucified in the first place. Allah protected Jesus from the harms of his enemies and raised him up to the heavens.

Comment: The response provided accurately represents the Islamic belief regarding Jesus not being crucified. However, from a Christian worldview, the significance of Jesus' death on the cross goes beyond the defeat of Satan's dominion. It is central to the Christian faith as it represents the atonement for the sins of humanity and the reconciliation between God and mankind. Understanding and accepting the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross is crucial for believers as it forms the foundation of their faith and shapes their spiritual life.
