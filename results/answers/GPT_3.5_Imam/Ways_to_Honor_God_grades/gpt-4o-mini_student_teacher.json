  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response, while providing good suggestions for spiritual practices, completely misses the mark in addressing the concern of actionable expressions of faith and worship in everyday life from a Christian perspective. The answer lacks the essential elements of thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and showcasing His greatness, which are central to honoring God in daily life according to the Christian worldview."
