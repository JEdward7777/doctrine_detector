While it focuses on Islamic practices, the student correctly suggests universal principles applicable to Christians. The inclusion of practical steps like prayer, studying the Bible, acts of kindness, and living a virtuous life demonstrates an understanding of how these actions can honor God. However, the answer would benefit from a clearer connection to Christian-specific practices and biblical references to strengthen its relevance to the question."
