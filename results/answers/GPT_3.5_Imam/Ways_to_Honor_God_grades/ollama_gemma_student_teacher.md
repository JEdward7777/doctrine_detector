**Comment:** 

The student's answer addresses the concern of exploring actionable expressions of faith and worship in everyday life. While it focuses on Islamic practices, the student correctly suggests universal principles applicable to Christians. The inclusion of practical steps like prayer, studying the Bible, acts of kindness, and living a virtuous life demonstrates an understanding of how these actions can honor God. However, the answer would benefit from a clearer connection to Christian-specific practices and biblical references to strengthen its relevance to the question.
