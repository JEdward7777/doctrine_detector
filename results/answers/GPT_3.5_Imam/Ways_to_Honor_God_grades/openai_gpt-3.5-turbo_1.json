The suggestions encompass prayer, Bible study, acts of kindness, virtuous living, seeking forgiveness, gratitude, contentment, seeking knowledge, and embodying sincerity, humility, and love for God and His creation. However, the perspective provided is from a different religious background, which may slightly alter the specific Christian worldview emphasis on certain practices."
