  "grade_comment": "Grade: 0\n\nComment: The student's response completely missed the mark as they approached the question from a Muslim perspective rather than a Christian one. The answer focused on Islamic beliefs about worship and idols, and while it stressed respect and dialogue, it did not address the concern raised or provide examples of modern idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God. The student did not demonstrate an understanding of the specific worldview required for this question."
