# Question [Worship of God](../../../questions/Worship_of_God.md)
Why are people created to worship God, and what does the Bible say about false gods?

People were created to worship God, the only true God, as indicated in the Bible. False gods are described as nonliving idols that people mistakenly worship, detracting from the true worship of Yahweh.

# Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of worshiping the true God helps us avoid the pitfalls of idolatry in our lives.

# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Imam](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Imam.md)
In Islam, it is believed that human beings are created to worship Allah (God). The Quran states in Surah Adh-Dhariyat (51:56): "And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me." As Muslims, we understand that worshiping Allah is our primary purpose in this world and that obeying His commands and following His guidance leads to a fulfilling and purposeful life.

Regarding the concept of false gods, the Quran is clear in condemning the worship of anything other than Allah. It categorically rejects associating partners with Allah (shirk) and emphasizes Tawhid (the belief in the oneness of God). Surah Luqman (31:13-14) states: "And [mention, O Muhammad], when Luqman said to his son while he was instructing him, 'O my son, do not associate [anything] with Allah. Indeed, association [with him] is great injustice.'"

In Islam, belief in false gods or worshiping anything other than Allah is considered a grave sin and a violation of the core principles of monotheism. Muslims are commanded to worship Allah alone and to avoid all forms of polytheism and idolatry.
