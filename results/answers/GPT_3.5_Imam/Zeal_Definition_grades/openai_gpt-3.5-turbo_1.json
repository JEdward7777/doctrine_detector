  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear comparison between the Islamic concept of zeal and the Christian understanding of zeal, highlighting the differences in how it is expressed and applied in each faith. The inclusion of the concern about understanding the biblical context of zeal adds depth to the evaluation. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
