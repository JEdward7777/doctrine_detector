The answer also effectively expands on the Christian perspective by emphasizing the importance of zeal in obeying God and teaching others. However, there could have been a stronger focus on the biblical context of zeal to further emphasize the foundational principles behind the concept. Overall, a well-articulated response that integrates both worldviews effectively."
