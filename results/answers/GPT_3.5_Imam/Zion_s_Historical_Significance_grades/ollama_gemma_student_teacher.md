Mount Zion holds great historical significance in relation to King David in Islam. According to Islamic tradition, King David (Prophet Dawud) received divine inspiration and revelation on Mount Zion, and it is considered a sacred site where he established his kingdom. It is believed that Prophet Dawud built a mosque on Mount Zion where he worshipped and prayed to Allah.

Additionally, Mount Zion is also believed to be the site where the Ark of the Covenant was placed during King Davidâ€™s reign. The Ark is considered a sacred relic in Islam, representing the covenant between Allah and the Children of Israel.

King David is revered in Islam as a prophet and a righteous ruler, known for his wisdom, justice, and piety. His connection to Mount Zion symbolizes the importance of faith, prayer, and obedience to Allah in establishing and maintaining a just and prosperous society.
