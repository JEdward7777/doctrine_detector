  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided some information about Mount Zion's historical significance in Islam, but it did not address the importance of Mount Zion in the biblical narrative and its connection to key figures in Scripture. It focused more on Islamic traditions related to Prophet Dawud (King David) rather than the biblical context. To improve the grade, the response should have included more Christian-specific perspectives on Mount Zion from the Bible."
