However, the focus on the Islamic perspective overshadowed the Christian specific worldview concerning Mount Zion and its importance in relation to King David and other key figures in Scripture. It would have been stronger if it had delved deeper into the biblical significance of Mount Zion and its associations with figures such as King David, Solomon, and Jesus from a Christian worldview perspective."
