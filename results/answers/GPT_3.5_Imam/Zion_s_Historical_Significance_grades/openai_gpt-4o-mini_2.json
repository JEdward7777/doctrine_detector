  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provided valuable insight into the Islamic perspective on Mount Zion, particularly in relation to Prophet Dawud (King David) and the Ark of the Covenant. However, the grade is lower as it lacks a detailed connection to the biblical narrative and key figures in Scripture, which was the specified concern. It would have been stronger if it included more explicit references to the biblical accounts of King David's capture of Mount Zion and its significance in Jewish and Christian traditions."
