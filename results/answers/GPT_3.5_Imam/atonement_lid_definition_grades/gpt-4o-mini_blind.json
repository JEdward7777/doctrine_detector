In a Christian worldview, the atonement lid symbolizes the covering of sins through the sacrificial blood sprinkled by the high priest, pointing towards the ultimate atonement provided by Jesus Christ through His sacrificial death on the cross. The response would have been stronger if it had incorporated the Christian understanding of atonement and forgiveness through Christ."
