The concern is specifically about understanding the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament, but the response only scratches the surface.\n\nAdditionally, the response focuses more on Islamic teachings and practices rather than explicitly exploring the symbolic meaning of the atonement lid in the Old Testament. To fully address the concern, a more detailed analysis and explanation of the symbolism is needed."
