In Islamic belief, the Ark of the Covenant, known as "Tabut al-Sakina," is not specifically mentioned in the Quran, but some scholars believe it was similar to the Ark mentioned in the story of Prophet Musa (Moses) in the Old Testament. The atonement lid, also known as the mercy seat, was placed on top of the Ark and served as the place where the high priest would sprinkle the blood of sacrificial animals on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) to seek forgiveness for the sins of the Israelites.

In Islamic teachings, seeking forgiveness for sins is a fundamental aspect of worship. Muslims believe in seeking forgiveness directly from Allah through sincere repentance and seeking His mercy. We do not require an intermediary, such as a mercy seat or priest, to seek forgiveness or atonement for our sins. As individuals, we are responsible for seeking forgiveness from Allah, repenting sincerely, and striving to avoid committing sins in the future.

The concept of seeking forgiveness and atonement is central to Islamic beliefs and practices. Muslims are encouraged to seek forgiveness regularly through prayers, acts of charity, fasting, and seeking knowledge. The mercy and forgiveness of Allah are limitless, and sincere repentance is always accepted. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of seeking forgiveness and repenting for one's sins to attain spiritual purification and closeness to Allah.
