However, the connection to the Islamic belief regarding forgiveness and atonement could have been more clearly articulated to fully address the concern of understanding the symbolic representation within the Christian worldview. Additionally, more direct comparisons or contrasts between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on atonement and seeking forgiveness could have enhanced the response."
