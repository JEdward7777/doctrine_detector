It is important to emphasize the biblical context and traditional interpretations in this type of question, rather than solely focusing on diverse perspectives without offering a strong Christian viewpoint. Encouraging respect for different beliefs is commendable, but it should not overshadow the need for doctrinal correctness when discussing biblical topics."
