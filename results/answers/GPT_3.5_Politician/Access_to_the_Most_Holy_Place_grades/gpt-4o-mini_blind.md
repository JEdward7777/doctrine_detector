In ancient Jewish tradition, the "most holy place" in the temple was restricted to the high priest, who could enter only on the Day of Atonement. This restriction was important as it symbolized the unique role and responsibility of the high priest in mediating between the people and the divine. It also emphasized the sacredness and purity of the space, ensuring that it was treated with the utmost reverence and respect.

Comment: The answer provides a solid explanation of who was permitted to enter the "most holy place" and why this restriction was important in ancient Jewish tradition. It correctly highlights the role of the high priest as a mediator and the emphasis on the sacredness and purity of the space. The only improvement would be to explicitly mention the significance of the high priest's role in carrying out the atonement for the sins of the people on the Day of Atonement.
