In ancient Jewish tradition, the "most holy place" in the temple was restricted to the high priest, who could enter only on the Day of Atonement. This restriction was important as it symbolized the unique role and responsibility of the high priest in mediating between the people and the divine. It also emphasized the sacredness and purity of the space, ensuring that it was treated with the utmost reverence and respect.
