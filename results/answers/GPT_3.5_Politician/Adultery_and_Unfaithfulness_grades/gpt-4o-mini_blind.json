However, from a Christian worldview, the answer could be improved by highlighting the biblical teaching on marriage as a sacred covenant before God, where faithfulness is not just about loyalty to one's spouse but also a commitment to honor God through the union. Additionally, a mention of forgiveness, redemption, and restoration within the context of Christian teachings on marriage could have enhanced the answer."
