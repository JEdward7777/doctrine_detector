  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60.\n\nWhile the student correctly identifies that being \"unfaithful\" in marriage involves breaching trust and betraying one's spouse, they miss the Christian-specific aspect of understanding marriage in relation to God's design. The reference answer explicitly ties the concept of unfaithfulness in marriage to the biblical analogy of Israel's unfaithfulness to God, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness and loyalty in spiritual and marital commitments. The student's response lacks this deeper theological connection, hence the lower grade. To improve their answer, the student should have incorporated the biblical perspective on marriage as a reflection of Christ's relationship with the church and the significance of faithfulness in representing this sacred covenant."
