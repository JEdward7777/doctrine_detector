However, it lacks a crucial element from a Christian perspective, which is the theological significance of Passover as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb who takes away the sins of the world. The answer could have been improved by mentioning the spiritual symbolism of Passover in pointing towards the sacrifice and redemption brought by Jesus."
