Comment: The student provided a decent understanding of the cultural and religious significance of the Passover celebration for the Israelites. However, the response falls short in addressing the specific Christian worldview concern of recognizing the importance of remembrance in faith. The answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the role of remembrance in reaffirming God's faithfulness and deliverance in Christian belief.
