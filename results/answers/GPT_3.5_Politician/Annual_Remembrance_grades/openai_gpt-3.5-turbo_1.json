However, the response could be improved by explicitly connecting the concept of remembrance in the Passover celebration to the importance of remembrance in Christian faith, such as how Christians commemorate Jesus' sacrifice through the Eucharist. Making this connection would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
