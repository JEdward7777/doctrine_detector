However, the concern raised about the importance of remembrance in Christian faith could have been better addressed by connecting the concept of remembrance in Passover with Christian beliefs, such as how Christians commemorate Jesus' sacrifice through the practice of communion. Overall, a well-written response that could have further integrated the Christian perspective on remembrance."
