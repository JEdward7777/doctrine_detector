From a Christian worldview, receiving the Holy Spirit is not just about experiencing a deep connection to beliefs or a higher power; it is the indwelling of the third person of the Holy Trinity in a believer's life. The anointing symbolizes the empowering and equipping work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life for ministry and service. The response falls short in articulating the biblical and theological significance of receiving the Holy Spirit and being anointed."
