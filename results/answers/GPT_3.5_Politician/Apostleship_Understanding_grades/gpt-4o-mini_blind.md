Comment: While the answer touches on some positive aspects of the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus, it lacks depth and misses the central theological significance. It fails to emphasize the foundational role of the apostles in establishing the early church and spreading the core message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The answer could benefit from a stronger focus on the spiritual authority and commissioning that the apostles received from Jesus.
