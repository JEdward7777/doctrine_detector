  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does mention the significance of the apostles' sending, which is relevant to the concern about understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission. However, it focuses more on the general values and teachings of Jesus rather than the specific purpose and authority given to the apostles by Christ himself. The response also does not explicitly mention the Great Commission or its importance.\n\nThe concern is specifically about understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission, which suggests that the focus should be on the apostles' mission, authority, and commissioning by Jesus. While the response mentions the transmission of teachings, it does not fully address this concern.\n\nComment: The response has some relevant points, but could be more specific about the apostles' role in the Great Commission."
