Comment: The response overall provides a strong understanding of the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission by emphasizing the authority and mission given to the apostles by Jesus. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by explicitly mentioning the specific instruction given by Jesus in the Great Commission to "go and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19). This would have provided more clarity and depth to their response.
