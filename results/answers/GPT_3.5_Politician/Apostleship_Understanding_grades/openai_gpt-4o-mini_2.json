  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does a good job of explaining the role of the apostles in preaching about God and his kingdom with the authority of Christ. However, there could be more emphasis on the Great Commission specifically and how the apostles played a key role in fulfilling this command of spreading the Gospel to all nations. A stronger connection to the specific concern raised would have resulted in a higher grade."
