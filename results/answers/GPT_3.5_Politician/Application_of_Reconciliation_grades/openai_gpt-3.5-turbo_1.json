The response also addresses the concern by emphasizing the practical implications of reconciliation in daily life, which aligns well with Christian teachings on how individuals should embody reconciliation through their actions. The only area for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or practical steps for how Christians can implement reconciliation in their daily interactions."
