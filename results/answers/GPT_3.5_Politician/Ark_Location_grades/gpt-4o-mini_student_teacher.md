Comment: The student's answer accurately identifies that the ark of the covenant was located in the innermost part of the tabernacle, known as the Holy of Holies. This demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God in the tabernacle. However, they could have explicitly mentioned the term "most holy place" to align perfectly with the teacher's reference answer for a higher score.
