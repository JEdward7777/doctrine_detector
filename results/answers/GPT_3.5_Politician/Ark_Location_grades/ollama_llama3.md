80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The student correctly identifies the location of the ark as being in the most holy place, which is equivalent to the "innermost part of the tabernacle" mentioned in their response. However, they did not explicitly mention the significance of this location or the presence of God, which is the concern specified.

To improve this response, the student could have elaborated on why the Most Holy Place was so sacred and what it meant for God's people to have His presence among them. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a basic understanding of the location of the ark, which is an important aspect of understanding the significance of the Most Holy Place.

Comment: The student shows good foundational knowledge, but could benefit from further development on the spiritual implications of the ark's presence in the Most Holy Place.
