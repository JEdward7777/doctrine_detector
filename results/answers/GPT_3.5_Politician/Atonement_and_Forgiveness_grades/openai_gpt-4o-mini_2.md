In Christianity, the concept of atonement is often understood as the reconciliation of God and humanity through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. This act of atonement is seen as a means of reconciling human beings with God, restoring the broken relationship caused by sin. 

Forgiveness is a central theme in Christianity, as followers are taught to forgive others as they themselves have been forgiven by God. The idea is that through forgiveness, individuals can be reconciled with one another and with God. 

In this context, atonement can be seen as the ultimate act of forgiveness and reconciliation, as God offers forgiveness and reconciliation to humanity through the sacrifice of Jesus. This act is believed to bring about a new relationship between God and humanity, one based on love, grace, and forgiveness.
