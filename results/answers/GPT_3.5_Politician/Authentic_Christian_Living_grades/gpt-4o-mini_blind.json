However, it could be improved by explicitly mentioning the biblical context of the verse and connecting it to the broader message of love and authenticity in Christian living as outlined in the book of Romans. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the Christian worldview perspective could enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
