  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has a strong understanding of the verse in Romans 12:9 and accurately conveys the message of love without hypocrisy. They effectively address the concern of living out our faith authentically by emphasizing the importance of expressing love in a truthful and authentic manner. The response could have been slightly improved by explicitly mentioning the need to avoid deceitful or pretentious behavior as highlighted in the reference answer. Despite this, the student's answer demonstrates a solid comprehension of the verse and its application to living authentically as representatives of Christ's love."
