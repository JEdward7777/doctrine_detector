  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60. \n\nWhile the answer attempts to define \"divine authority\" and discuss its significance for believers, it lacks specificity in terms of a Christian understanding of divine authority. It provides a general overview that could apply to various religious traditions, but it does not delve deeply into the implications of divine authority within the Christian faith. Additionally, it does not emphasize the primacy of divine authority in guiding a believer's life choices and actions according to Christian doctrine. \n\nA stronger response would have incorporated scriptural references, theological insights, and a more focused exploration of how divine authority shapes the life of a Christian believer specifically. It is important for the student to consider and incorporate distinctive Christian perspectives when addressing theological concepts within a Christian-specific worldview."
