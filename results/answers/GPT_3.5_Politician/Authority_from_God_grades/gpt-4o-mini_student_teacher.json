  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 50.\n\nWhile the student provided a general understanding of what divine authority may entail, they missed addressing the significance of divine authority in the life of a believer as outlined in the concern. The student also focused more on acknowledging the diversity of beliefs rather than emphasizing the Christian perspective of divine authority and its importance in discerning God's will and maintaining obedience. Moving forward, the student should delve deeper into the specific implications of divine authority for a believer's faith journey to provide a more comprehensive response."
