Thank you for your question. "Divine authority" typically refers to the belief that a higher power, such as a deity or divine being, has the ultimate power and control over individuals' lives and their moral or ethical decisions. For believers, the concept of divine authority can provide guidance, a sense of purpose, and a source of comfort or strength in times of difficulty.

It's important to acknowledge that beliefs about divine authority can vary widely among different religious traditions, and not all individuals may subscribe to this concept. As a politician, it is important to respect and be inclusive of diverse religious beliefs and understandings of authority to ensure that all individuals feel valued and represented in discussions of faith and spirituality.
