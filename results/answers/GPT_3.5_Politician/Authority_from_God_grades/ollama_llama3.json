  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of explaining the concept of \"divine authority\" and its significance for believers. It correctly identifies the source of divine authority as God, which aligns with the provided answer. Additionally, it highlights the importance of respecting diverse religious beliefs and understandings of authority, which is relevant to the concern about maintaining obedience in one's faith journey.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. Firstly, while it mentions the guidance and comfort that divine authority can provide, it does not explicitly connect this concept to discerning God's will or maintaining obedience, which are key aspects of the concern. Secondly, the response could benefit from more biblical support for its claims about divine authority.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding divine authority, but could be strengthened by more explicit connections to the concern and additional scriptural backing."
