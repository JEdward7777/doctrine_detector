  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the correct understanding that governing rulers have been established by God and possess authority to govern, as suggested in Romans 13:1-2. The response also correctly emphasizes the importance of rulers governing justly and with wisdom, showing compassion and fairness to all people.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the concept of government authority to the concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. While the response mentions that \"all authority comes from God,\" it does not directly address the concern of obedience or the specific biblical teachings related to this topic.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the biblical teaching on government authority, but could be strengthened by more explicitly addressing the concern of obedience and our responsibility to submit to governing authorities."
