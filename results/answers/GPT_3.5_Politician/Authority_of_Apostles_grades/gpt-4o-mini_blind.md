Comments: The student provides a satisfactory explanation of the relationship between the authority of the apostles and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly within the context of their faith tradition. The answer demonstrates an understanding of the belief that the apostles' authority stems from their connection to Christ and the spiritual gifts they received. However, the response could be strengthened by incorporating specific biblical references that support this concept, as well as delving deeper into the theological implications of apostolic authority. Furthermore, the ending note on respect for differing viewpoints is commendable but slightly detracts from the doctrinal focus of the response. Overall, the answer is sound but could benefit from more depth and specificity.
