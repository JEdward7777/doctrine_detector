  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the relationship between the authority of the apostles and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly within the context of their faith tradition. The answer acknowledges the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles, although it could have further emphasized the direct connection to God's empowerment and Jesus' authority, as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, integrating more specific examples of miracles performed by the apostles could have strengthened the response. Nevertheless, the student demonstrates a good grasp of the concept and communicates effectively."
