  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, as requested. It provides a clear and concise explanation of how the apostles' authority is understood within their faith tradition, highlighting their close association with Jesus and the spiritual gifts they received. The response also acknowledges the importance of respecting different viewpoints when discussing religious faith and tradition.\n\nWhile the response does not directly mention Jesus' empowerment of the apostles for ministry, it does touch on this theme by noting that the apostles' actions and teachings are guided by divine inspiration. This is a significant connection to make, as it emphasizes the role of God in empowering the apostles for their ministries.\n\nOne area for improvement might be to more explicitly state the connection between the apostles' authority and Jesus' empowerment. However, overall, this response does an excellent job of exploring the concern and providing relevant insights from a Christian perspective."
