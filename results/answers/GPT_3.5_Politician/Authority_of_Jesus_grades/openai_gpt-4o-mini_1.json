It effectively highlights the dual aspect of Jesus' authority both over the Jewish people and over all creation, emphasizing His divine kingship. The concern about understanding Jesus' authority tying into believers acknowledging His sovereignty is addressed well. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the understanding of Jesus' authority with the importance of recognizing His sovereignty in the lives of believers."
