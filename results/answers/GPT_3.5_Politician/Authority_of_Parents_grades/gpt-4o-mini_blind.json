However, it falls short in fully embracing and articulating the Christian worldview on this topic. It is important for the student to confidently explain and defend biblical principles without diluting them with relativism or secular perspectives. The emphasis should be on the authoritative nature of Scripture in establishing the role of parental authority as God-given and essential for raising children in accordance with biblical teachings. Encouraging an understanding of diverse perspectives is valid, but it should not detract from presenting the Christian perspective clearly and boldly."
