  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good start by referencing Ephesians 6:1-4 which addresses the importance of parental authority over children from a Christian perspective. However, the student's answer lacked depth in elaborating on the biblical basis for parental authority and could have further emphasized the significance of parental guidance in shaping children according to God's principles. Additionally, while acknowledging diverse perspectives is important, the response could have highlighted the unique foundation of parental authority in Christianity more strongly."
