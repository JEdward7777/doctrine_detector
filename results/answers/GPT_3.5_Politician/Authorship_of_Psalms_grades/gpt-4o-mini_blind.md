Comment: The answer correctly identifies King David as traditionally attributed to writing the Psalms, which is essential. However, it could be improved by mentioning other key figures such as Asaph, the sons of Korah, Solomon, and others who also contributed to the Psalms. Additionally, emphasizing the divine inspiration behind the writing of the Psalms from a Christian worldview would strengthen the response.
