In order to promote understanding and inclusivity, it may be beneficial to carefully consider how language and terminology are interpreted in different cultures.

Comment: The student's answer emphasizes cultural sensitivity and inclusivity, which are important aspects to consider in communication. However, in a Christian worldview, the primary concern should be ensuring accurate understanding and representation of Jesus' identity. Therefore, while it is important to be respectful of cultural differences, avoiding the term 'Son of God' in translations may hinder individuals from fully grasping the theological significance and truth about Jesus. In this case, the reference answer provides a more appropriate perspective from a Christian worldview.
