It highlights the importance of understanding diverse perspectives and using language that is appropriate for different audiences. However, the response does not fully address the theological aspect of the concern, which is to maintain the integrity of the biblical terminology. The reference answer correctly points out that the meaning of the term \"Son of God\" should be carefully explained in different contexts to prevent misunderstandings."
