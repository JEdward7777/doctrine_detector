  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response acknowledges the importance of being sensitive to diverse beliefs and cultural contexts, which aligns with the concern about avoiding significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. The suggestion to use language that is more universally understood and avoid specific religious connotations is also a good approach.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about teaching the meaning of the term through context and explanation, as suggested by the given answer. Instead, it focuses on the importance of using considerate language usage and striving for respectful communication.\n\nOverall, while the response is thoughtful and well-intentioned, it could be strengthened by incorporating a more explicit discussion of how to carefully teach the meaning of the term in different cultural contexts, rather than simply avoiding potential misunderstandings."
