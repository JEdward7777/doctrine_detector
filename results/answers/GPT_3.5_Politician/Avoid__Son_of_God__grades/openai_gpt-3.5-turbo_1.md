It is important to be sensitive to the diverse beliefs and cultural contexts of all individuals. In order to promote understanding and inclusivity, it may be beneficial to carefully consider how language and terminology are interpreted in different cultures. One approach could be to use language that is more universally understood and does not carry specific religious connotations that may be misunderstood or offensive to some. It is always important to strive for respectful communication and considerate language usage when interacting with diverse audiences.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern by emphasizing the importance of not avoiding the term but rather explaining its meaning within the appropriate context. This approach aligns well with a Christian worldview that values clarity and understanding in communicating theological concepts, particularly concerning Jesus' identity. The only slight deduction is to further emphasize the importance of being sensitive and respectful in the explanation to ensure effective communication without causing offence.
