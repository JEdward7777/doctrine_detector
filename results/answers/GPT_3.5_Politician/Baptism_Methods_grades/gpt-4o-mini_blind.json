The explanation is clear and covers the main practices in different denominations. The response could have been improved by providing more specific scriptural references for each method of baptism and delving deeper into the theological significance behind each practice. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the importance of obedience to biblical teachings regarding baptism would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the answer.
