It acknowledges the diversity of interpretations and practices within the Christian faith regarding baptism. The inclusion of specific examples of denominations associated with each method further enriches the response. However, to improve, a brief mention of the theological significance and symbolism associated with each method would enhance the overall depth and understanding of baptism within a Christian worldview."
