  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a generally accurate overview of the significance of baptism in Christianity, highlighting common themes such as purification, rebirth, forgiveness of sins, and initiation into the Christian community. The response could be improved by emphasizing the doctrinal importance of baptism according to New Testament teachings, such as its connection to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the symbolism of dying to sin and rising to new life, and the role of baptism in salvation and obedience to Christ's command. The answer lacks depth in articulating the theological underpinnings of baptism in the New Testament context."
