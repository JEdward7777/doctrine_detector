  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the significance of baptism in the Christian faith, encompassing various interpretations and beliefs held by different denominations. They accurately highlighted baptism as a symbol of purification, rebirth, initiation into the Christian community, spiritual cleansing, forgiveness of sins, and acceptance into the family of God. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by explicitly emphasizing the core Christian belief that baptism signifies being cleansed from sin and united with Christ, as stated in the reference answer. Great effort overall."
