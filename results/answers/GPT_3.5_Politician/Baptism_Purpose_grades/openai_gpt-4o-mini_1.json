  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately acknowledges that baptism signifies being cleansed from sin and united with Christ, which is a central concept in Christian theology regarding baptism. However, the response lacks a bit of depth in explaining the broader significance and symbolism of baptism within the Christian faith, such as its role in initiation into the Christian community and as an outward expression of inner faith and commitment. More elaboration on these aspects would have strengthened the response further."
