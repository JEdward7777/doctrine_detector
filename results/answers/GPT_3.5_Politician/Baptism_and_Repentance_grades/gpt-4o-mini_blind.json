  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 85.\n\nThe response provides a solid overview of the relationship between repentance and baptism in the New Testament from a Christian perspective. The student accurately highlights the importance of repentance as turning away from sin and committing to following a righteous path before undergoing baptism, which symbolizes purification, rebirth, and renewal. The emphasis on repentance as a necessary step before baptism aligns with Christian teachings. Additionally, the explanation of baptism as an outward expression of inner transformation and dedication to God is well articulated.\n\nTo improve the response, the student could delve deeper into specific biblical references that highlight the connection between repentance and baptism, such as Acts 2:38 or Mark 1:4-5. Including more direct scriptural support would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could benefit from a more robust integration of biblical passages to strengthen its doctrinal foundation."
