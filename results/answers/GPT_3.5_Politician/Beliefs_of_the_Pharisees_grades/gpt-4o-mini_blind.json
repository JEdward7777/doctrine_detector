  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 75. \n\nThe response provides a general overview of the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings, mentioning the belief in an afterlife, judgment, angels, demons, and acknowledging diversity within Judaism on these topics. However, the answer lacks depth and specificity in explaining the Pharisees' beliefs, particularly in relation to their scriptural and traditional basis. \n\nTo improve, the student could provide more specific examples or references from Jewish scripture or writings that support the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings. Additionally, the response could be strengthened by emphasizing the Pharisees' emphasis on the resurrection of the dead and their interpretation of texts like Daniel 12 in relation to these beliefs. \n\nOverall, while the answer shows a decent understanding of the topic, it could benefit from more detailed explanations and references."
