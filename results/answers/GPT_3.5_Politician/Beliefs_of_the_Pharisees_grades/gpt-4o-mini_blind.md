The beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings were complex and were rooted in their interpretation of Jewish scripture and traditions. It is important to recognize that different sources within Judaism may have varying interpretations, and there is diversity of beliefs within any religious group.

In general, the Pharisees believed in an afterlife where the righteous would be rewarded and the wicked would face judgment. They believed in the existence of angels, demons, and other spiritual beings that could influence human lives. It is also important to note that the beliefs of the Pharisees were not monolithic and varied among different sects and individual scholars.

It is essential to approach these topics with sensitivity and respect for differing beliefs and interpretations within the Jewish community.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would give this answer a grade of 75. 

The response provides a general overview of the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings, mentioning the belief in an afterlife, judgment, angels, demons, and acknowledging diversity within Judaism on these topics. However, the answer lacks depth and specificity in explaining the Pharisees' beliefs, particularly in relation to their scriptural and traditional basis. 

To improve, the student could provide more specific examples or references from Jewish scripture or writings that support the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings. Additionally, the response could be strengthened by emphasizing the Pharisees' emphasis on the resurrection of the dead and their interpretation of texts like Daniel 12 in relation to these beliefs. 

Overall, while the answer shows a decent understanding of the topic, it could benefit from more detailed explanations and references.
