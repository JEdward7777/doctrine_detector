  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does provide some accurate information about Pharisee beliefs, such as their view on life after death and the existence of angels. It also acknowledges the diversity of beliefs within Judaism and the importance of sensitivity when exploring these topics. However, the response falls short in providing a more detailed and nuanced understanding of Pharisee beliefs.\n\nThe concern is well-addressed in that it highlights the significance of exploring Pharisee beliefs for understanding the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time. The response could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or references to support its claims, as well as addressing potential objections or counterarguments.\n\nComment: While this response provides a good starting point for understanding Pharisee beliefs, it would benefit from further development and attention to detail."
