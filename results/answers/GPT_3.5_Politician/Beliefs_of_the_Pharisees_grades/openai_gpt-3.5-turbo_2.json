It addresses the concern by acknowledging that exploring these beliefs can enhance understanding of the spiritual context during Jesus' time. The response could have delved deeper into specific Pharisaic beliefs and provided more detailed examples, but overall it demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful approach to the subject matter."
