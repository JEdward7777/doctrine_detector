  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-explained and thoughtful discussion on the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings, considering the diversity within the Jewish community. The answer adequately addresses the concern by enhancing understanding of the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included more specific details or examples to further deepen the analysis."
