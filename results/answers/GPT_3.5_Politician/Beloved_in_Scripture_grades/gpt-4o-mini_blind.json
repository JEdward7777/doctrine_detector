However, it would have been beneficial to emphasize the divine foundation of this love, rooted in God's unconditional and sacrificial love for His people, which is mirrored in the term \"beloved\" used by the writers of the letters. It would have been even stronger if there was a direct connection made to the concept of believers being beloved children of God through Christ."
