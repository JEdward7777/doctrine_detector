However, the elaboration on the practical implications of this relationship could be more explicit. While the response touches on some practical benefits of sharing 'in Christ', it could be strengthened by providing specific examples or scenarios to illustrate how these implications manifest in individuals' lives. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated, but further clarity and depth in discussing the practical implications would enhance the response."
