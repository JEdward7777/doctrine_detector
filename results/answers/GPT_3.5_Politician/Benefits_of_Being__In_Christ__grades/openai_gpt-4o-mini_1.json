However, it could be improved by delving deeper into how these benefits translate into practical implications in everyday life. Emphasizing how these spiritual blessings manifest in actions, attitudes, and relationships would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the practical implications of a relationship with Christ from a Christian worldview perspective."
