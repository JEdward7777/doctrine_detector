I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response does a good job of summarizing the biblical concept of "fear not" and its application to believers' lives. It accurately conveys God's reassurance and encouragement to trust in His power and presence rather than succumbing to fear or anxiety.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:

* The phrase "against fear" is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible's use of "fear not", and while it is implied, it would be beneficial to clarify this further.
* While the response does touch on the idea that "fear not" strengthens faith and trust in God, it could delve deeper into the implications of this encouragement for Christians.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical concept of "fear not", but could benefit from some refinement to make its connection to Christian life more explicit.
