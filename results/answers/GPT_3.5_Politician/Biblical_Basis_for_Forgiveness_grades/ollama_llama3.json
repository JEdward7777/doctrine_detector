However, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, while the response does identify key verses supporting the practice of forgiveness among believers, it could be more comprehensive and include a wider range of scriptures to provide a more robust foundation for this doctrine. Secondly, the response could benefit from further development on how these biblical principles can practically be applied in everyday life. Nevertheless, the response effectively addresses the concern of identifying scripture that supports the practice of forgiveness among believers, making it a solid effort overall."
