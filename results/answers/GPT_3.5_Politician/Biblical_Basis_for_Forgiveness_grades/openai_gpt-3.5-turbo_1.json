The references to Matthew 6:14-15, Ephesians 4:32, and Colossians 3:13 align with the concern and showcase the biblical foundation for forgiveness within the Christian faith. The response could have been enhanced by providing a bit more discussion or personal reflection on the importance of forgiveness, but overall it is clear, concise, and grounded in scripture."
