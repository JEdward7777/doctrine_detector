Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a good understanding of the general responsibilities of deacons in supporting the community and ensuring well-being, but missed the specific emphasis on fair distribution of resources, particularly to widows, as outlined in the reference answer. Encouragement to pay closer attention to specific details from the Biblical text would further enhance their understanding.
