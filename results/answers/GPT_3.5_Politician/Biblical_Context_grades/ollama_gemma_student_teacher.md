**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** 
The student's answer adequately describes the responsibilities of deacons as outlined in the New Testament, emphasizing their role in supporting the needs of the community and assisting with tasks. However, it lacks specific reference to ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, which is the specified concern. Including such a mention would strengthen the overall response.
