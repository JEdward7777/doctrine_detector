  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately references the specific responsibility of deacons mentioned in the New Testament regarding the fair distribution of resources, with a focus on ensuring care for widows. This aligns well with the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community. The response could have been strengthened by also mentioning the broader scope of the deacons' responsibilities beyond just the distribution of resources."
