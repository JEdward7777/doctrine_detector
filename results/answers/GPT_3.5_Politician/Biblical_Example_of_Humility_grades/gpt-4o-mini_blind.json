  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided an excellent response by correctly identifying Jesus Christ as a biblical character who exemplified humility. The answer effectively highlights key aspects of Jesus' humility, such as selflessness, compassion, and service to others, and ties it back to the important lesson it teaches. The response could have been further enhanced by also mentioning other biblical characters like Moses or John the Baptist who also demonstrated humility. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound answer."
