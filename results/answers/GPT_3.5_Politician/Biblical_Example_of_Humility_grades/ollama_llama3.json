  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThis response meets the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in scriptures by citing Jesus Christ as an example of humility, which is indeed found in the Bible. The description of Jesus' actions and teachings also provides a good illustration of what it means to be humble. However, I would deduct some points because the response does not directly address the original answer about David being an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God. While the response is still relevant to the concern, it could have been more explicit in connecting Jesus' humility to the original example.\n\nComment: A good effort! The response effectively illustrates biblical concepts with a powerful example from Jesus' life, which shows that humility is indeed a tangible trait described in scripture. To take it to the next level, consider explicitly linking this example back to the original answer about David's humility and obedience to God."
