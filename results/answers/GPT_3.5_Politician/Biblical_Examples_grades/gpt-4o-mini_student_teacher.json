  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good answer by mentioning biblical figures such as Job, Noah, and John the Baptist as examples of blamelessness and drawing lessons from their lives. However, the reference answer specifically cited Abraham and Noah as examples of being blameless, so the student did not fully address the question. Additionally, the student could have elaborated more on the practical application of blamelessness in the lives of Christians."
