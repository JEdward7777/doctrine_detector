## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately identifies several biblical figures who are commonly referenced as examples of blamelessness and briefly explains what can be learned from their lives. However, it lacks additional elaboration on the practical application of blamelessness in Christian lives, as requested in the concern. Including references to the specific biblical passages where these figures demonstrate blamelessness would have strengthened the response.
