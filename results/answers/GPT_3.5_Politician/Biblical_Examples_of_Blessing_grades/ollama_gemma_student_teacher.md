**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the instance in Genesis where God blesses creation. However, it could benefit from additional elaboration on how the blessing of creation reflects God's character and purposes. The reference answer provided by the teacher highlights a specific verse that demonstrates God's blessing of the natural world, but it could be expanded to explore other biblical passages that emphasize the blessing of creation.
