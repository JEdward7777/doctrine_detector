  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response mentions Genesis, which is relevant to the concern of knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture, it does not specifically address the concern or directly relate to the given answer about God's blessing on the creatures of the sea and birds.\n\nThe response also does not demonstrate an understanding of the biblical concept of blessing beyond mentioning that God blessed creation on the seventh day. It would be improved by explicitly connecting the idea of blessing in Genesis 1:22 to the broader theme of God's blessing throughout scripture.\n\nA higher score could be achieved if the response more directly addressed the concern, drew connections between different biblical accounts, and demonstrated a deeper understanding of the concept of blessing in scripture."
