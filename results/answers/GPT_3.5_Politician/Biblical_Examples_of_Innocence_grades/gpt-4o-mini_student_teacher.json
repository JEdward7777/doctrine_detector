  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70. \n\nWhile the student's answer touches on the trial of Jesus before Pilate and his response to false accusations, it lacks specific examples from Scripture that directly illustrate Jesus' innocence. The student could have improved their answer by directly referencing the specific verses mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, the response could have been stronger if it had delved deeper into the theological implications of Jesus' innocence in Christian beliefs.\n\nOverall, the student showed a good understanding of the topic but fell short in providing specific and pertinent examples from Scripture."
