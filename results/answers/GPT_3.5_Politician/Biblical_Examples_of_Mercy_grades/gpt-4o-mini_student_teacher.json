  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy, such as the story of the Prodigal Son, Jesus forgiving the woman caught in adultery, and the parable of the Good Samaritan. However, the student could have enhanced their answer by including additional scriptural references like the tax collector's prayer for mercy in Luke 18:13, as mentioned in the reference answer. Providing more diverse scriptural references would have further enriched the understanding of mercy within a Christian worldview."
