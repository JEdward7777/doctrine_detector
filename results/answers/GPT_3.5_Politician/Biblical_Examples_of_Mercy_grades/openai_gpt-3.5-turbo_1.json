However, the response could have been strengthened by providing a more detailed explanation of how these examples enhance understanding of mercy both in scripture and in real-life applications. A deeper analysis of the connection between the examples given and the concept of mercy would have further demonstrated the significance of mercy in the Christian worldview."
