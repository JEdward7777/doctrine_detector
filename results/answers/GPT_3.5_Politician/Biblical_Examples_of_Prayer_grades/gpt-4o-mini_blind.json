However, it lacks specific examples from the Bible that illustrate this power, such as the story of Elijah praying for rain or Jesus praying in Gethsemane. The closing statement on respecting differing viewpoints is valid but slightly detracts from the focus on the question about examples of prayer in the Bible. Additionally, the response could benefit from a deeper exploration of the theological significance of prayer in Christian belief."
