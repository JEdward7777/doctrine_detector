However, the student could have strengthened their answer by incorporating specific biblical examples like Isaac praying for Rebekah's fertility, Moses praying for the people, and Jesus instructing His disciples to pray to avoid temptation. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into specific biblical narratives would enhance their understanding and application of prayer in a Christian worldview."
