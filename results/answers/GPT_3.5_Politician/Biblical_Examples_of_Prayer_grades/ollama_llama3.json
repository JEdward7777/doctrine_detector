  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does mention biblical examples, including specific verses like Psalms and Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, which aligns with the concern of learning from biblical stories to foster a stronger prayer life. It also acknowledges the importance of approaching discussions on religious texts with sensitivity and respect for differing viewpoints, which is relevant to the concern.\n\nHowever, while the response mentions some examples, it doesn't specifically address the biblical stories mentioned in the correct answer (Isaac praying for Rebekah's fertility, Moses praying for the people, and Jesus instructing His disciples to pray to avoid temptation). It also lacks a clear connection between these examples and how they can be applied to foster a stronger prayer life.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more specific biblical examples that align with the concern, and to explain how these examples can be used to inform and strengthen one's prayer practice."
