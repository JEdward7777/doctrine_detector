  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided examples from the Bible, such as the story of the prodigal son and King David, that demonstrate repentance. While the student's answer is accurate and reflective of the concept of repentance, the student could have included more diverse biblical examples as provided in the reference answer. Expanding on the variety of biblical instances of repentance would have strengthened the response."
