  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of repentance in the Christian faith. They provide clear and relevant examples from the Bible to support their points. The inclusion of specific references to the stories of the prodigal son and King David adds depth and context to their examples. However, the response could benefit from a broader range of references to other biblical instances of repentance."
