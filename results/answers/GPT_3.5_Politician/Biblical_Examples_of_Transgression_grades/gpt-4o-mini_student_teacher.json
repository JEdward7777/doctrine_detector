  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student did mention the concept of transgression in the Bible and provided some relevant references. However, the answer would have been stronger if it directly referenced Biblical passages that specifically showcase the idea of transgression against God's commands, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. The response could benefit from more focus on Biblical examples rather than a general discussion on religious interpretations."
