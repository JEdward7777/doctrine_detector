  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of trespass in the Bible and provides relevant examples from Matthew and Romans. The response clearly explains the moral and spiritual lessons associated with trespass, including the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation. However, including the reference to 1 Samuel 25:28 and Romans 5:20-21 would have strengthened the response and aligned it more closely with the provided concern."
