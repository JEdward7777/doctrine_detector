## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
Certainly. One example from the Bible where worship is contrasted with idol worship can be found in the Ten Commandments, specifically in Exodus 20:3-5. This passage states, "You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God."

This passage clearly distinguishes between worshiping the one true God and worshiping idols. It emphasizes the importance of giving reverence and worship only to God and not to any created image or object.
