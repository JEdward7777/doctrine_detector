  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained and accurate answer referencing Exodus 20:3-5, which effectively contrasts worship of the one true God with idol worship as outlined in the Ten Commandments. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of avoiding idolatry in worship, aligning well with the Christian perspective on this topic. A minor adjustment could be made by directly citing Exodus 20:3 in the response for a more concise answer, as shown in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response with a solid biblical reference and application of the concern provided."
