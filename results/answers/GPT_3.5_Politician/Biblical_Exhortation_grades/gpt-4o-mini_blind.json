However, it lacks specific reference to the actual directive Jesus gave regarding the good news, which was to preach the gospel, repentance, and forgiveness of sins in His name to all nations (Luke 24:47). Additionally, the importance of faith in Christ for salvation could have been emphasized more clearly."
