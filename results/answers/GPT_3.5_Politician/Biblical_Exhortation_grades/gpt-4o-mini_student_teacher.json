  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response by emphasizing love, compassion, and forgiveness in spreading the good news. However, the student missed addressing the crucial aspect of trust in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin as the core message instructed by Jesus to his apostles. Therefore, the grade is slightly lower as it deviated from the specific directive Jesus gave regarding the good news."
