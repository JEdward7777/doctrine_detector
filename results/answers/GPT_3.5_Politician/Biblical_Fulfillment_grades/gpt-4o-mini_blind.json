However, it lacks depth and specific references to Old Testament scriptures that foretell the coming of a messianic figure who would hold the title of \"King of the Jews.\" The response also places too much emphasis on general sensitivity and respect towards diverse beliefs, rather than diving into the doctrinal significance and fulfillment aspect of these prophecies within a Christian worldview. More scriptural support and doctrinal explanation would greatly enhance the response."
