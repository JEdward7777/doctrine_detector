The answer did not directly address how the title reflects Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah from David's line who would establish an everlasting kingdom, which is crucial for understanding the significance of Jesus as the \"King of the Jews\" in Christian theology. The discussion on sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs, while important, was not directly related to the question or the Christian perspective on biblical prophecy fulfillment. More focus on connecting the specific prophecies with Jesus as the fulfillment would have strengthened the response."
