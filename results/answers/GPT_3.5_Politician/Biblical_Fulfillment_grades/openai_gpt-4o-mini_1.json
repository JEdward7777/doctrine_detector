The focus on sensitivity to diverse beliefs and perspectives detracts from the central Christian worldview that sees Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies. The response could strengthen its Christian perspective by highlighting the significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of specific prophecies in shaping Christian beliefs about salvation and the Kingdom of God."
