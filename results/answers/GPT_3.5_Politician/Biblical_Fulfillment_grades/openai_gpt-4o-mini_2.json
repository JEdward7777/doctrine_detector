The focus on respecting diverse beliefs and perspectives, while important in interfaith dialogue, somewhat detracts from the importance of understanding biblical prophecy fulfillment within a Christian worldview. Encouraging open dialogue and mutual understanding is positive, but the response could have highlighted the foundational role of biblical prophecy in Christian theology more strongly."
