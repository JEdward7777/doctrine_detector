  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a relevant Bible verse (Psalm 8:1) that illustrates God's majesty, which aligns with the question. However, the student could have further enhanced their response by including additional verses such as those provided in the reference answer for a more comprehensive understanding of God's majestic nature based on Scripture. Additionally, the student's statement on respecting varied interpretations of scripture is valid and demonstrates sensitivity to differing beliefs."
