  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nThe response does attempt to connect the concept of God's majesty with scripture, citing Psalm 8:1 as an example. However, it falls short in fully developing this connection or addressing the concern explicitly. The Bible reference provided is somewhat generic and doesn't specifically illustrate God's majestic nature.\n\nA higher grade could be achieved by more thoroughly exploring how the cited Bible verse demonstrates God's majesty, and/or incorporating more specific examples from scripture that better illustrate this concept."
