The Bible contains many verses that highlight the awe-inspiring majesty of God. One example could be Psalm 8:1, which reads: "O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens."

It is important to approach religious texts with respect and sensitivity, acknowledging that interpretations of scripture may vary among individuals and communities.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 60

The response does attempt to connect the concept of God's majesty with scripture, citing Psalm 8:1 as an example. However, it falls short in fully developing this connection or addressing the concern explicitly. The Bible reference provided is somewhat generic and doesn't specifically illustrate God's majestic nature.

A higher grade could be achieved by more thoroughly exploring how the cited Bible verse demonstrates God's majesty, and/or incorporating more specific examples from scripture that better illustrate this concept.
