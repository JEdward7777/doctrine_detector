The references given complement the initial response and deepen the exploration of God's majesty in the Bible. The inclusion of multiple verses enhances the richness of the explanation. However, it would have been even stronger if there was some additional analysis or explanation of how these specific verses contribute to the overall understanding of God's majestic nature."
