  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response misses the mark on addressing the question from a Christian-specific worldview. Instead of providing Old Testament references that contribute to the understanding of the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah, the answer focuses on political correctness, diversity, and inclusivity. The grade reflects the need for a substantial revision with a focus on doctrinal correctness and providing relevant Old Testament references in relation to the Messiah."
