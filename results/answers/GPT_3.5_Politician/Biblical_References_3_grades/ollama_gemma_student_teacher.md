While the student's response demonstrates sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs and perspectives, it lacks specific engagement with the assigned concern. The response primarily addresses the importance of inclusivity and avoids making definitive statements, but it fails to provide detailed analysis of the Old Testament references that contribute to the understanding of the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah, as requested in the question. The reference answer provides specific biblical passages relevant to the topic, which the student's response lacks.
