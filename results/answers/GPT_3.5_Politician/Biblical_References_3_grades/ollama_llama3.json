The key references mentioned are relevant to the topic, but they could have been more explicitly tied to the discussion of Jesus' messianic role.\n\nThe response also focuses on the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and fostering inclusivity in discussions about religious topics, which is valuable but not directly related to the specific concern being addressed.\n\nTo improve, the response should have explored how the Old Testament references mentioned (Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel) specifically inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the Son of Man."
