Grade: 85

Comment: The response provided a solid foundation by referencing key Old Testament passages that inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.' However, the excessive emphasis on political correctness and inclusivity, while important in certain contexts, detracted a bit from the Christian-specific worldview focus needed for the given concern. Encouraging respectful dialogue is essential, but the primary focus should remain on accurately and confidently presenting how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Messiah.
