Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges important Old Testament references related to the 'Son of Man' as the Messiah, which is commendable. However, the concern was not fully addressed as the focus was more on the importance of respecting diverse beliefs rather than delving into how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.' While inclusivity and sensitivity are important, a stronger connection to the specific concern would have improved the response.
