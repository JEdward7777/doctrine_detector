However, there is a lack of emphasis on the Christian interpretation of Jesus as the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy in these Old Testament scriptures. While respecting diverse beliefs is important, the response could have further emphasized the unique Christian perspective on the identity of Jesus as the Son of Man in relation to Old Testament prophecies."
