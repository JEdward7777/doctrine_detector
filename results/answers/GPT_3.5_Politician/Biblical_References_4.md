Certainly, in the context of Christianity, the term "Lord" is often used to refer to God. Here are a few examples of biblical passages that illustrate this:

1. Psalm 23:1 - "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
2. Matthew 22:44 - "The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'"
3. Philippians 2:11 - "and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
4. Revelation 19:16 - "On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: king of kings and Lord of lords."

These passages demonstrate the reverence and authority associated with the term "Lord" when referring to God in Christian belief.
