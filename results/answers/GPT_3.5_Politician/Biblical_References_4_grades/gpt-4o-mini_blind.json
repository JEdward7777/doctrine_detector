  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides relevant biblical passages that illustrate the use of \"Lord\" in the context of God within Christianity. The examples chosen effectively showcase the reverence and authority associated with the term \"Lord.\" However, for a higher grade, the response could have included a bit more explanation or elaboration on the significance of \"Lord\" in these specific passages or in Christian theology overall. Nevertheless, the chosen passages align well with the Christian worldview."
