  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided relevant biblical passages and connected them to the concept of God's authority as Lord, demonstrating an understanding of the relationship between the term \"Lord\" and God's divine nature within a Christian perspective. However, the student could have included a more concise explanation tying each passage directly to the concept of God's authority and lordship to strengthen the response further."
