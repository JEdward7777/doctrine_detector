## Question [Biblical References 4](../../../questions/Biblical_References_4.md)
Can you give examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11, where 'Lord' references the authority and divinity of God.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing biblical references helps reinforce the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord.

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_4.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
Certainly, in the context of Christianity, the term "Lord" is often used to refer to God. Here are a few examples of biblical passages that illustrate this:

1. Psalm 23:1 - "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
2. Matthew 22:44 - "The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'"
3. Philippians 2:11 - "and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
4. Revelation 19:16 - "On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: king of kings and Lord of lords."

These passages demonstrate the reverence and authority associated with the term "Lord" when referring to God in Christian belief.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided relevant biblical passages and connected them to the concept of God's authority as Lord, demonstrating an understanding of the relationship between the term "Lord" and God's divine nature within a Christian perspective. However, the student could have included a more concise explanation tying each passage directly to the concept of God's authority and lordship to strengthen the response further.
