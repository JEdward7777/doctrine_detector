## Question [Biblical References 4](../../../questions/Biblical_References_4.md)
Can you give examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11, where 'Lord' references the authority and divinity of God.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing biblical references helps reinforce the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord.

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_4.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
Certainly, in the context of Christianity, the term "Lord" is often used to refer to God. Here are a few examples of biblical passages that illustrate this:

1. Psalm 23:1 - "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
2. Matthew 22:44 - "The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'"
3. Philippians 2:11 - "and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
4. Revelation 19:16 - "On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: king of kings and Lord of lords."

These passages demonstrate the reverence and authority associated with the term "Lord" when referring to God in Christian belief.

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of "Lord" in Christian theology. They provide relevant and well-chosen biblical passages to support their claims. However, including the reference answer provided by the teacher would have elevated the grade to 90/100.
