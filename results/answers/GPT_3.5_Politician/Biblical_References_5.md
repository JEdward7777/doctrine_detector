While it is important to recognize and appreciate the diverse beliefs and practices of all individuals, it is worth noting that the concept of unleavened bread holds significance in the Christian faith in relation to the Last Supper, as described in the New Testament scriptures of Matthew 26:17-30, Mark 14:12-26, and Luke 22:7-30. These scriptures illustrate how Jesus shared unleavened bread and wine with his disciples during this significant event, which is commemorated in the Christian tradition through the sacrament of Communion or the Eucharist.
