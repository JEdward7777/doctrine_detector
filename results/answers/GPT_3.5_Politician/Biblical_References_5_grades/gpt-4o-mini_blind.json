  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response accurately references the connection between unleavened bread and Christian teachings, specifically in relation to the Last Supper and the sacrament of Communion. The student effectively highlights the significance of the concept in the Christian faith and provides relevant New Testament scriptures to support their explanation. However, to improve the grade, the response could have elaborated further on the theological implications and symbolism of unleavened bread within Christian teachings."
