  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response touches on the significance of unleavened bread in Christianity, but fails to fully address the concern of identifying relevant biblical texts that provide insight into Christian practices. While it mentions the Last Supper and Communion/Eucharist, it does not directly reference or engage with the provided answer (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) or other key biblical texts related to unleavened bread. The response also lacks a clear connection between the biblical text and Christian life and purity, as mentioned in the original answer. To improve, the response could incorporate more explicit references to relevant biblical texts and explore their implications for Christian practices."
