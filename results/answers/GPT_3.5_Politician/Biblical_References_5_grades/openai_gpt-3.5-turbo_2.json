  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively identifies another relevant biblical text (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) that discusses the significance of unleavened bread in the context of Christian practices, specifically in relation to life and purity within the church. This demonstrates a strong understanding of how biblical texts provide insight into Christian practices. The response effectively integrates this additional text with the original answer, enhancing the explanation provided. Great job!"
