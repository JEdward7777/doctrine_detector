The inclusion of verses such as John 11:25-26, 1 Corinthians 15:20-22, and 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 accurately portrays the Christian perspective on resurrection. The response could have been improved by providing further contextual explanations of these verses to deepen the understanding of the concept of resurrection. Overall, a solid and respectful effort."
