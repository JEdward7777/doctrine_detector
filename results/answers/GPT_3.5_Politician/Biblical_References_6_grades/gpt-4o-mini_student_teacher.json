  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses that discuss the concept of resurrection, showing a good understanding of the topic. However, the student's answer could have been improved by including a wider range of verses that specifically address resurrection and eternal life. Additionally, the student's focus on sensitivity and political correctness, while important in certain contexts, detracts somewhat from the primary focus on grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts."
