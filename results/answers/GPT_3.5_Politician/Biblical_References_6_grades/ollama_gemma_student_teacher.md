## [Answer](../Biblical_References_6.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
As a politician, I strive to respect and honor all individuals' beliefs and backgrounds. The concept of resurrection is an important belief for many people, and there are several Bible verses that discuss this topic. Some verses that provide insight into the concept of resurrection include:

1. John 11:25-26: "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?'"

2. 1 Corinthians 15:20-22: "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."

3. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17: "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever."

It is important to approach discussions about religious beliefs with sensitivity and understanding, recognizing that not everyone shares the same beliefs. I hope these verses provide a starting point for further exploration of the concept of resurrection in the Bible.
