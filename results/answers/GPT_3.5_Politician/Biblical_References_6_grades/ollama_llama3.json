  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of focusing on scripture, as requested by the concern. The writer provides three relevant Bible verses that discuss the concept of resurrection, which is closely tied to the idea of eternal life. These verses are well-chosen and provide valuable insight into the Christian understanding of resurrection. The writer also acknowledges the importance of approaching discussions about religious beliefs with sensitivity and understanding.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response does not fully address the concern about focusing on scripture. While the response provides some relevant Bible verses, it could be improved by using more scripture to support the discussion. Additionally, the writer mentions that there are \"several Bible verses\" that discuss resurrection without specifically providing them, which could leave some readers wondering what those additional verses might be.\n\nOverall, I think this response is strong in its focus on scripture and provides valuable insight into the concept of resurrection. With a few tweaks to address the concern about using more scripture to support the discussion, it could be even stronger."
