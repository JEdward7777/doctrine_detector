  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of relevant Bible verses that discuss resurrection and eternal life, aligning well with the concern to focus on scripture for grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts. The inclusion of additional verses enhances the depth of understanding on the topic. The response could have further elaborated on each verse or provided some interpretation, but overall, it effectively integrates Christian worldview perspectives."
