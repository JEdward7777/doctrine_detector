  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of relevant Bible verses that discuss resurrection and eternal life within the Christian context. By including specific verses and their references, the response effectively grounds the discussion in authoritative Christian texts. The explanation is clear, respectful, and aligned with a Christian worldview. The only area for improvement would be to further elaborate on the significance of the verses mentioned in relation to the concept of resurrection."
