  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer is partially correct as it correctly mentions Exodus as a reference for the Sabbath, but it lacks specific references such as Exodus 31:14, Mark 2:27, and Isaiah 56:6-7 provided in the teacher's answer. The student did acknowledge the importance of the Sabbath in Christian faith, but the answer could have been enhanced by focusing more on the scriptural backing without diluting its Christian significance by mentioning other religious traditions."
