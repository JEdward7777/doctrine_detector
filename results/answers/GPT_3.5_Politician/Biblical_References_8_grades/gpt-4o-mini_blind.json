The explanation of how these verses contribute to the understanding of redemption is clear and accurate. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more in-depth analysis or insights from other relevant scriptures to enhance the understanding of the topic. Additionally, explicitly stating the foundational Christian belief that Jesus' sacrificial death serves as the ultimate ransom for humanity's sins would have further solidified the doctrinal correctness of the response."
