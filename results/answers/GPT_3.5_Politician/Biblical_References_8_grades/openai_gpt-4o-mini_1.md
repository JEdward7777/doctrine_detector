One verse that mentions the concept of ransom is 1 Timothy 2:6, which states "who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time." This verse is often interpreted as referring to Jesus Christ giving his life as a ransom for the sins of humanity, offering salvation and redemption to all who believe in him.

Another well-known verse that relates to the concept of ransom is Mark 10:45, where Jesus says, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." This verse underscores the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death and the belief that through his sacrifice, believers can be redeemed and saved.
