Thank you for your question. The concept of covenant faithfulness is an important theme in the Bible. Some verses that relate to this concept include:

1. Deuteronomy 7:9 - "Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations."

2. Psalm 25:10 - "All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies."

3. Jeremiah 31:31-33 - "Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people."

I hope these verses are helpful in understanding the concept of covenant faithfulness in a respectful and inclusive manner.
