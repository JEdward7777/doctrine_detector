To improve, the student should delve deeper into the theological implications of Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 in relation to the inclusion of Gentiles, highlighting the role of faith in Christ's sacrifice for salvation and the abolishment of barriers between Jews and Gentiles in the body of believers."
