  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response does mention Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16, which are indeed relevant passages for exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion, it primarily focuses on the theme of inclusivity rather than specifically highlighting the apostolic mission to Gentiles or emphasizing faith in Jesus as justification before God. The response's emphasis on love, compassion, and understanding towards all people is also a good point, but it doesn't directly address the concern about exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest delving more deeply into the specific passages provided, highlighting their relevance to the apostolic mission to Gentiles, and demonstrating how they support the understanding that faith in Jesus is what justifies people before God."
