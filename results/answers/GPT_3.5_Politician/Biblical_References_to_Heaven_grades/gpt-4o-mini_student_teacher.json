  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a generally respectful and open-minded response acknowledging different beliefs about heaven. However, the student's answer lacked specific Bible verses that provide insight into the concept of heaven as requested. It would have been more effective if the student had included key verses related to heaven from a Christian perspective, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
