  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The response correctly identifies the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy as containing references to the Festival of Weeks. However, the explanation lacks depth and does not fully capture the significance of the festival from a Christian perspective. The closing statement about respecting diverse religious beliefs, while commendable in a secular context, is not directly relevant to the question asked. To improve the grade, the student could have included additional context on how the Festival of Weeks foreshadows Pentecost in the New Testament or the parallels between the giving of the Torah and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit."
