  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student correctly identified the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy in the Old Testament that mention the Festival of Weeks. However, they did not fully address the scriptural importance of Pentecost as the reference answer provided. Additionally, the student's response veered off-topic with a statement unrelated to the scriptural basis for Pentecost. It is important for the student to focus on addressing the specific concern given and providing a thorough Christian perspective in their answer."
