The Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot in Judaism, is mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible in the book of Exodus (Exodus 34:22) and the book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 16:10). The festival holds significant spiritual and cultural importance for the Jewish people, and it celebrates the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. As a politician, I respect and acknowledge the diverse religious beliefs and practices of all individuals and communities.
