However, there is a lack of depth in explaining the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. A Christian worldview would require a more detailed explanation of the theological significance of Pentecost as the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the believers, which is a foundational event in the establishment of the Christian church."
