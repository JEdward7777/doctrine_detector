It correctly acknowledges the spiritual and cultural importance for the Jewish people. However, the response could have been improved by specifically addressing the Christian significance of Pentecost, which is a New Testament fulfillment of the Feast of Weeks. A deeper understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance of Pentecost in Acts would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
