However, the response lacks depth and a clear connection to the significance of Pentecost from a Christian perspective. It would have been beneficial to explain the connection between the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, emphasizing the fulfillment of prophecy and the birth of the Christian church. A more elaborate discussion on the spiritual significance of Pentecost would have strengthened the response."
