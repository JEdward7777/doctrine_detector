  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** While the student's response demonstrates respect for diverse perspectives and avoids making any theological pronouncements, it fails to address the specific concern of understanding scriptural foundations for the belief in Jesus as Savior as outlined in the prompt. The response lacks clarity in explaining how the passages from 1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20 support the notion of Christ as Savior."
