  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student accurately referenced Ephesians 2:20 and Acts 4:11, demonstrating an understanding of the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone in Christianity. The additional information provided about different denominations and beliefs shows an awareness of varying interpretations. However, the student missed referencing Matthew 21:42 and Psalms 118:22, which are important verses that further convey Jesus' role as the cornerstone. Encouraging deeper exploration of scripture could have been more explicitly tied back to the significance of understanding Jesus in this foundational role."
