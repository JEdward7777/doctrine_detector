  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response addresses the concern by encouraging believers to explore Scripture, specifically highlighting verses that emphasize Jesus' significance in their faith. The answer provided also connects nicely with the original response, as both mention Ephesians 2:20 and Acts 4:11, which further reinforces the idea of Jesus as the cornerstone.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response could be more detailed in its exploration of Scripture. For example, it would have been great to see some additional biblical references or explanations for how these verses deepen our understanding of Jesus' significance in faith. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a good foundation and shows an appreciation for the importance of Scripture in exploring Jesus' role.\n\nComment: This response is strong in its encouragement of believers to explore Scripture, which aligns nicely with the concern. To take it to the next level, consider adding more biblical references or explanations to further illustrate how these verses deepen our understanding of Jesus' significance in faith."
