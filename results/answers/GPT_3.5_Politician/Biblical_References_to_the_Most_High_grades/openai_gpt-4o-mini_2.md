Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a good summary of verses that highlight God's sovereignty and authority as portrayed in the Bible. The student effectively references specific verses (Psalm 83:18 and Daniel 4:17) to support their point. However, there could have been a deeper exploration of the significance of God's sovereignty in the Christian faith, linking it to key theological concepts such as providence and redemption. Encouraging further reflection on these aspects would enhance the overall response from a Christian worldview perspective.
