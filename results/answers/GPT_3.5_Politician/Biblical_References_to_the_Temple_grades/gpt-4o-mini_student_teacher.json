  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student demonstrated an understanding of the concept of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" and provided relevant references from the Old Testament. However, the student's answer could have been more focused on directly addressing the concern by providing more specific and accurate references such as 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4. The answer also veered slightly off-topic by discussing different faith traditions, which while important, was not directly relevant to answering the question. There is room for improvement in terms of precision and alignment with the provided concern."
