  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" in the Old Testament. They correctly identify the specific scriptures that reference this term and provide relevant examples from 2 Chronicles. Additionally, they acknowledge the importance of respecting diverse interpretations of religious texts, which demonstrates sensitivity and inclusivity. However, providing more specific verse references would have earned them a higher grade."
