  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides an accurate and relevant reference to the key scriptures that discuss the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" in the context of God's presence. It aligns well with the concern provided and demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective. The only minor improvement would be to expand further on the significance of these scriptures within Christian theology."
