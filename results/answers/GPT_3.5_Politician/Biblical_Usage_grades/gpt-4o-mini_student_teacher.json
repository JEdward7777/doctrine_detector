They also correctly highlighted the importance of considering the cultural and historical contexts when interpreting ancient texts. However, the student could have further emphasized the significance of these genealogies in establishing Jesus' lineage and fulfilling prophecies, connecting the usage of \"begat\" to the broader theological context."
