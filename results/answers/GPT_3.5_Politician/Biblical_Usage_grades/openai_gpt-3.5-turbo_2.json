It acknowledges the historical and cultural context of ancient texts like the Bible, which is important in interpreting genealogies accurately from a Christian worldview. The only improvement could be to explicitly connect the explanation to the significance of genealogies for Jesus' lineage and fulfillment of prophecies in the response."
