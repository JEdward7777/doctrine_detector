However, the answer falls short in accurately stating the full scope of the term's significance, particularly in connection to God's judgment. The use of \"woe\" in context often signifies impending judgment or divine displeasure, reflecting God's righteous standards and the consequences of disobedience. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration of the theological implications of \"woe\" in relation to God's judgment as portrayed in the Bible."
