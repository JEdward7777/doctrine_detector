  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a decent overview of the use of the term \"woe\" in the Bible, particularly in addressing warnings and expressions of distress. However, the student's response lacks depth in connecting the term to the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to highlight how 'woe' is used to emphasize severe judgment upon sin and leading others astray, as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, while the student's answer is informative, it could be improved by delving deeper into the significance of 'woe' in relation to divine judgment."
