  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical use of the term \"woe\" and its connection to divine judgment. The student provides relevant examples from both the Old and New Testaments to support their argument. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific consequences or judgments associated with the use of \"woe\" in these passages. Additionally, the student's conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of \"woe\" to the Christian worldview and its implications for personal and societal transformation."
