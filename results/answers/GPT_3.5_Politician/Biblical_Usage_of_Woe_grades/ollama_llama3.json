  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides some relevant biblical examples that support the use of \"woe\" to emphasize severe judgment, which aligns with the concern about examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. However, the response does not fully engage with the specific answer provided, instead offering a more general explanation of the term's usage.\n\nThe comment I would provide is:\n\n\"While this response provides some relevant biblical examples, it could be improved by more directly addressing the specific answer provided and further developing the theme of divine judgment. A stronger connection to the concern about examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture would also enhance the response.\""
