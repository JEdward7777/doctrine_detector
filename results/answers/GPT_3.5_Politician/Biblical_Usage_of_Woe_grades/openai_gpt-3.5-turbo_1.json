It effectively incorporates examples from both the Old Testament and New Testament to support the explanation. The focus on living in accordance with God's values and the call to repentance align well with the concern of divine judgment expressed through scripture. However, a slightly fuller exploration of the severity of divine judgment, especially in contrast to God's righteousness, could have enhanced the response further."
