It also references specific verses in Isaiah and Matthew to support the explanation. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture, as it primarily focuses on the moral implications of the term \"woe\" rather than the judgment aspect. Overall, a well-written and informative response but lacking in directly engaging with the specified concern."
