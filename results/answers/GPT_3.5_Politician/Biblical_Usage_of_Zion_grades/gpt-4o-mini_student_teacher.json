  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of the figurative uses of the term \"Zion\" in the Bible, mentioning its association with Jerusalem, Israel, and the people of God. However, the student missed mentioning its connection to God's spiritual kingdom and the future heavenly Jerusalem. Encouraging deeper exploration and connection with the broader spiritual implications would enhance the response."
