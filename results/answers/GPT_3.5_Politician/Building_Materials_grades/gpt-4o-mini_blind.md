Comments: The response provides a general overview of the materials used to construct altars during biblical times, but it lacks specific references to biblical passages or examples. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to emphasize the significance of sacrifices and offerings made on these altars for worship. The inclusion of specific biblical examples and theological insights would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
