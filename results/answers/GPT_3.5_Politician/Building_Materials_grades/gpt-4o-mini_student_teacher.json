  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the common materials used to construct altars during biblical times, mentioning stone, wood, and metal. However, there was a slight deviation in the answer regarding the prevalence of packed dirt and large stones in altar construction. The answer also appropriately highlighted the symbolic importance of these materials and acknowledged the diversity of religious traditions, which is important in understanding biblical practices and reverence in worship. Improving the accuracy of specific materials commonly used in altar construction would further enhance the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
