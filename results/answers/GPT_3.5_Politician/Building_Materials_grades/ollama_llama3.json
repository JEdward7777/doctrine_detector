  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe LLM response provides some accurate information about the materials used to construct altars in biblical times, mentioning stone, wood, and metal. It also acknowledges the cultural significance and symbolic importance of these materials in worship practices. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:\n\n* While the response mentions stone as one material used for altars, it does not specifically address packed dirt or large stones, which is an important detail mentioned in the provided answer.\n* The response could benefit from more explicit connections to biblical practices and worship. While it acknowledges the importance of understanding altar construction, it does not explicitly discuss how this knowledge can deepen a Christian's understanding of reverence in worship.\n\nOverall, the response provides some good information, but could be stronger in terms of addressing specific details and making clear connections to biblical practices and worship."
