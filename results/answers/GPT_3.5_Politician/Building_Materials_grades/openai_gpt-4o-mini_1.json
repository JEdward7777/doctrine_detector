  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a good overview of the materials used in constructing altars in biblical times, mentioning packed dirt, large stones, and wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze. The understanding of the materials and structure of altars can indeed deepen a Christian's appreciation of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship. The response could have been improved by providing more specific references to biblical examples of altars made from these materials and how they were used in worship practices."
