  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90.\n\nThe student's response accurately identifies the common materials used for constructing altars in biblical times, such as packed dirt, large stones, wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze. This knowledge aligns well with a Christian worldview as it adds depth to one's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship. The response could have elaborated further on the significance of these materials in the context of worship and their spiritual symbolism. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern provided.\n\nGreat work!"
