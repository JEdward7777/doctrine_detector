Comment: The response does well in emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process by pointing out the command for believers to sanctify themselves to God and be holy. It aligns with a Christian worldview that emphasizes personal accountability in one's faith journey. The only slight deduction in points is due to the lack of explicit mention of the role of grace and the Holy Spirit in the sanctification process, which is important in Christian theology.
