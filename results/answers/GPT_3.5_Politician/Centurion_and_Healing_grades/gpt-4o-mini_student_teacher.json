  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus, exploring themes of faith and authority. The response effectively highlighted the centurion's humility and faith, as well as Jesus' recognition of the centurion's exceptional faith. However, the student's answer deviated slightly from the specific concern by delving into additional themes such as humility and compassion in relationships of authority. To improve the grade, the response could have focused more directly on the nature of faith and authority as pertaining to Jesus' ministry, as outlined in the reference answer."
