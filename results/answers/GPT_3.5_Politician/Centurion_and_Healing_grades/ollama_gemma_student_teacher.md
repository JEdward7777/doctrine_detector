The interaction between the centurion and Jesus highlights the themes of faith and authority in a nuanced way. The centurion, a symbol of authority in Roman society, demonstrates humility and respect by approaching Jesus for help despite his status. His faith in Jesus' ability to heal his servant is evident in his words, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
