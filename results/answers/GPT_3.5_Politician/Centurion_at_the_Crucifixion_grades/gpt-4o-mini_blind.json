However, the response could have been further strengthened by delving into the doctrinal implications of the centurion recognizing Jesus as the Son of God, emphasizing the role of this event in the affirmation of Jesus' divinity and its impact on Christian theology. Overall, a solid answer with room for deeper theological exploration."
