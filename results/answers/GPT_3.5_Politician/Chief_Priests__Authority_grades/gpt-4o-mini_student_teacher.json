  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student failed to engage with the Christian-specific worldview given in the reference answer. In the context of ancient Israel, according to the Christian worldview, the chief priests indeed held a higher rank and authority over ordinary priests, with the high priest being the most authoritative. The response provided by the student lacks depth and fails to align with the Christian understanding of the religious leadership structure in ancient Israel."
