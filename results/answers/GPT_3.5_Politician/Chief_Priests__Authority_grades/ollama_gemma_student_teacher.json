  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the general concept of hierarchical leadership in ancient religious institutions. However, it lacks specific reference to the authority of chief priests and ordinary priests within the context of Christian theology or biblical accounts. To improve the grade, the student should have addressed the concern by providing more detailed information about the authoritative relationship between chief priests and ordinary priests in accordance with Christian beliefs and interpretations of relevant biblical passages."
