Comment: The answer provides a general overview of the Christian perspective on honoring parents by mentioning Exodus 20:12 and Ephesians 6:2, which is good. However, it lacks depth and specificity in elaborating on the biblical teachings regarding how children should honor their parents. The response could benefit from a more detailed explanation and referencing additional relevant Bible verses to support the understanding of honoring parents within the Christian faith.
