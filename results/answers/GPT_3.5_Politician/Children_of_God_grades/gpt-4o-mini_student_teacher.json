  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer shows an awareness of the diversity of interpretations within religious communities, which is important. However, the answer does not specifically address the impact of being referred to as 'children of God' on the relationship between believers and God from a Christian perspective. Providing a response that engages with the Christian worldview and relates to the concern raised would have improved the grade."
