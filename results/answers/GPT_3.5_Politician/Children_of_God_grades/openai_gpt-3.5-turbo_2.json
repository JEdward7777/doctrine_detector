The concern is addressed by highlighting how this understanding could deepen one's faith and sense of belonging in the Christian community. The only improvement would be to further emphasize the spiritual implications and blessings that come with this relationship, connecting it to the broader theological framework of adoption into God's family through Jesus Christ."
