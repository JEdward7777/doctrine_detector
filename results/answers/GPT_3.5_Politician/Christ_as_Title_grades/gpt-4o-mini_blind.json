  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 70. \n\nWhile the student acknowledges the significance of the term \"Christ\" and encourages respect for diverse interpretations, the answer lacks depth in explaining the evolution of the term throughout the New Testament from a Christian perspective. It is important for the student to delve deeper into the theological implications and developments within the New Testament regarding the term \"Christ\" to provide a more comprehensive answer. Encouraging sensitivity and respect is commendable, but the focus should primarily be on doctrinal accuracy in addressing the question."
