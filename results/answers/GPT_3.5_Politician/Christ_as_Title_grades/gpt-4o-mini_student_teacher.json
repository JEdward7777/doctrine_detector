  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a respectful and inclusive perspective on the term \"Christ,\" acknowledging its significance to various individuals. However, the student's answer lacks depth and specific detail on the evolution of the term throughout the New Testament and how it deepens understanding of Jesus's identity and purpose. Encouraging the student to provide more focused information relating to the historical and theological context surrounding the term 'Christ' would enhance the response from a Christian worldview."
