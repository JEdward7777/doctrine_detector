  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student acknowledges the importance of respecting different beliefs and practices, their answer does not directly address the concern of incorporating ancient teachings into contemporary faith practice to enhance spiritual growth and accountability. The student's response lacks specific practices that modern Christians could adopt to reflect the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. They provide a general overview and focus more on diversity and sensitivity rather than offering concrete examples relevant to the question and concern."
