It correctly highlights how these practices can symbolize and seek a state of moral and spiritual cleanliness akin to Old Testament rituals. The concern about enhancing spiritual growth and accountability through incorporating ancient teachings is well-addressed. However, the response could further emphasize the transformative power of these practices in deepening one's relationship with God and living out Christian faith in a more tangible way, which would have strengthened the Christian perspective further."
