  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as an 85.\n\nThe answer provides a good general understanding of what it means to have a \"clear conscience\" in the context of Christian teachings. It correctly highlights the importance of living a life in alignment with one's beliefs and values, being honest, seeking forgiveness, and experiencing inner peace. However, it could be improved by emphasizing the central role of Jesus Christ in the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing of one's conscience, as taught in Christian theology. Additionally, mentioning the role of the Holy Spirit in convicting believers of sin and guiding them towards righteousness would enhance the doctrinal accuracy of the answer."
