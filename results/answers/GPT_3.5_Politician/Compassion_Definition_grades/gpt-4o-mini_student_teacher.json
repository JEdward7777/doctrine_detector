  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student accurately captures the essence of compassion as defined in the Bible by mentioning key components such as kindness, mercy, understanding, and actions to help others in need. They also include important actions associated with compassion like helping, comforting, and showing empathy. The student's emphasis on approaching situations with an open heart and a non-judgmental attitude aligns well with biblical teachings on compassion. However, the student could have further highlighted the centrality of concern for the suffering of others in the biblical definition of compassion to align more closely with the reference answer."
