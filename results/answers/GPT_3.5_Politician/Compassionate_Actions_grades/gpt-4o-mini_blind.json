The references to the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus feeding the multitude, and Ruth's kindness towards Naomi are appropriate and showcase different aspects of compassion. The student effectively connects these examples to the broader theme of kindness and empathy towards others, aligning well with a Christian worldview. Great job!"
