  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as an 80. \n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 and discusses the importance of mercy, compassion, and divine justice. They also emphasize the need for balance in approaching punishment as a form of condemnation. While the student's response provides a thoughtful reflection, it could be further strengthened by explicitly linking the teachings to the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. Additionally, a more direct connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher would have enhanced the coherence of the response.\n\nOverall, the student's answer shows a solid grasp of the topic but could benefit from more explicit integration of the key concepts outlined in the reference answer."
