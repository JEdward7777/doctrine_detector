The integration of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 demonstrates an attempt to address the concern raised and emphasizes the importance of compassion, redemption, and justice in the Christian worldview. Going forward, further elaboration on specific ways to practically implement these principles in the context of punishment could enhance the response."
