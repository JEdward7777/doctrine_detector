The student could improve by delving deeper into the specific connection between confession and belief in relation to salvation as outlined in Paul's teachings. Additionally, while acknowledging diverse interpretations is important, in this context a more thorough exploration of the specific theological implications of confession and belief in salvation according to Paul would have strengthened the answer."
