  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the importance of confessing that Jesus is Lord and believing in His resurrection for salvation, aligning well with the Christian belief in salvation through faith in Christ. The explanation is sound and reflects a solid understanding of the theological implications, thus earning a high grade. However, it would have been even stronger if it had elaborated further on how this confession and belief lead to salvation in a deeper theological context."
