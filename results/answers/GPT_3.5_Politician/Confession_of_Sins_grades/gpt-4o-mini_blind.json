The answer could have cited specific verses or examples from the Bible that highlight the importance of prayer, reliance on fellow believers, self-control, and repentance in overcoming temptation. The emphasis should be on the authoritative teachings of the Bible rather than personal interpretation and alignment with individual beliefs and values. Additional depth and specificity rooted in biblical doctrine would have improved the response."
