  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer correctly mentions seeking guidance from religious texts and leaders in times of temptation, which is a good practice. However, the answer lacks a direct reference to the importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness, as specified in the concern. The importance of confessing sins and seeking God's forgiveness is foundational in the Christian faith, and this aspect should have been emphasized more in the response for a higher grade."
