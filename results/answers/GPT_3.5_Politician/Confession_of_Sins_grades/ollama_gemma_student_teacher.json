  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern by referencing the importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness. It also suggests practical steps based on biblical teachings. However, the answer lacks a direct connection to the specific biblical references or verses that address temptation and forgiveness in Christian theology. Including such references would elevate the quality of the response."
