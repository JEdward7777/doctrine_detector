  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the biblical definition of conscience and its function according to Christian beliefs. They correctly emphasized that conscience is viewed as an inner sense of right and wrong given by God and guided by moral principles, particularly those found in the Bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ. The response could have been enhanced by including specific references to biblical passages that discuss conscience, but overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic."
