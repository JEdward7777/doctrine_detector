  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80 \n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of individuals mentioned in the Bible who were consecrated to God, including Samuel, Jeremiah, Mary, John the Baptist, and the apostle Paul. However, the student missed mentioning key consecrated individuals such as priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child as specified in the teacher's reference answer. It's essential to recognize the significance of these individuals in biblical history to provide a more complete response."
