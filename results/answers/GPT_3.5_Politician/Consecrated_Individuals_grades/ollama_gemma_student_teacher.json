  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately identifies several individuals from the Bible who are considered consecrated or set apart for God's purposes. They provide clear examples like Samuel, Jeremiah, Mary, John the Baptist, and Paul. However, the response would benefit from a broader understanding of individuals consecrated within the context of their communities. Mentioning the priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child as additional examples would strengthen the response from the teacher's reference answer."
