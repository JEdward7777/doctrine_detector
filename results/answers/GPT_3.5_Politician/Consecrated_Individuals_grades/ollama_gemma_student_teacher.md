In the Bible, there are many individuals who are seen as consecrated or set apart for God's purposes. Some examples include Samuel, who was dedicated to the Lord by his mother Hannah; the prophet Jeremiah, who was set apart by God from before he was born; and Mary, the mother of Jesus, who was chosen by God to bear His son. Others who are considered consecrated include John the Baptist, who was set apart to prepare the way for Jesus, and the apostle Paul, who was called by God to spread the message of Christianity.

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately identifies several individuals from the Bible who are considered consecrated or set apart for God's purposes. They provide clear examples like Samuel, Jeremiah, Mary, John the Baptist, and Paul. However, the response would benefit from a broader understanding of individuals consecrated within the context of their communities. Mentioning the priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child as additional examples would strengthen the response from the teacher's reference answer.
