In a Christian context, the act of consecration typically refers to setting apart something or someone as sacred or dedicated to a specific purpose, often through a formal or ritualistic ceremony. This could involve a person being consecrated as a religious leader, such as a bishop, or an object such as a church or religious artifact being consecrated for religious use.
