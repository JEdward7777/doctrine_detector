However, the response could have been strengthened by providing more specific examples of evil actions such as killing, stealing, and slandering as indicated in the biblical references. Additionally, the conclusion about sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs is relevant, but could have been tied back more explicitly to the impact of evil actions on communities and relationships as outlined in the concern."
