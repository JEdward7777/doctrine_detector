## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
The Bible emphasizes the importance of humility and warns against the dangers of pride. Proverbs 11:2 states, "When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom." Similarly, Proverbs 16:18 cautions that "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." Humility is also praised throughout the Bible, such as in Philippians 2:3-4, which encourages believers to "do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others."

It is important to remember that interpretations of religious texts may vary, and I strive to be respectful of all beliefs and perspectives.
