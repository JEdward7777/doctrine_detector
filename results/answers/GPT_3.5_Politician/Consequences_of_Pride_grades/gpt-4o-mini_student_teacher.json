  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the importance of humility and the dangers of pride as presented in the Bible. They referenced appropriate verses to support their points. However, the additional insight provided in the reference answer about God's role in humbling the proud and lifting up the humble could have been included to deepen the analysis further. Overall, a good response from a Christian worldview perspective."
