  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the given answer to the concern by referencing specific biblical verses that emphasize the spiritual implications of pride and humility. However, it could be further strengthened by elaborating on how God's promise to humble the proud and exalt the humble relates to the overall theme of pride and humility throughout the Bible. Additionally, the response could have tied in the importance of seeking God's grace and guidance to cultivate true humility in light of these spiritual implications. Overall, a solid response with a clear Christian worldview perspective."
