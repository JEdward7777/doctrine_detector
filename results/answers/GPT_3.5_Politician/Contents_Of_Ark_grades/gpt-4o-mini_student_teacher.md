Comment: The student showed a general understanding of the significance of the ark of the covenant and mentioned the tablets with the Ten Commandments. However, the response lacked accuracy in describing the specific items contained within the ark. Encouraging the student to focus on the details of biblical artifacts will improve their understanding of God's covenant with the Israelites.
