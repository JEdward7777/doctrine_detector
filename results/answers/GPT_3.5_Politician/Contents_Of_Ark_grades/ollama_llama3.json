However, it does not specifically address the contents of the ark, instead providing a general overview of its significance. While it mentions the Ten Commandments, it does not provide accurate information about what was contained in the ark. The response could be improved by incorporating more specific details from Scripture, such as the correct list of items that were stored in the ark."
