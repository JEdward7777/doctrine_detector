It lacks a distinct Christian perspective or reference to biblical principles that guide believers in recognizing and confronting corrupt influences in the world. Encouraging inclusivity and respect is important, but the answer could be strengthened by integrating teachings from scripture on discernment and spiritual warfare as tools for identifying corruption."
