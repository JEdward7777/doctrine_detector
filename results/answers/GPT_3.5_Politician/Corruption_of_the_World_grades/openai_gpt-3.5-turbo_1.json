While the answer given does align with a Christian worldview by mentioning behaviors and attitudes contradicting biblical teachings, there could be a stronger emphasis on the importance of staying vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living. Encouraging a deeper reflection on how corruption can specifically manifest in ways contrary to Christian values would enhance the response."
