Grade: 60

Comment: The response does a good job of discussing corruption in a general sense and emphasizing the importance of ethical values. However, from a Christian perspective, it lacks a direct reference to biblical teachings and the concept of sin. To improve the grade, the response could integrate more explicitly how Christians can discern corrupt influences based on biblical principles and the need to remain vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living.
