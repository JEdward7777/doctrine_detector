## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
In the Bible, there are both conditional and unconditional covenants that are seen as sacred agreements between God and his people. Some examples of unconditional covenants include God's covenant with Noah after the flood, promising to never again destroy the earth with a flood (Genesis 9:11). Another example is God's covenant with Abraham, promising to make him the father of many nations and to bless him and his descendants (Genesis 17:4-8).

On the other hand, conditional covenants in the Bible include the covenant at Mount Sinai, where God promised to make the Israelites his treasured possession if they obeyed his commands (Exodus 19:5). Additionally, the covenant with King David was conditional on his descendants following God's ways (2 Samuel 7:12-16).

It is important to approach these covenants with sensitivity and respect for the beliefs of others, as they hold deep meaning for many individuals across different faith traditions.
