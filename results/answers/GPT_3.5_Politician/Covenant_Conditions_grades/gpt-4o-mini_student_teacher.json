  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a good understanding of both unconditional and conditional covenants in the Bible, providing relevant examples for each. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused on the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants, as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, the concluding statement about respecting the beliefs of others, while important in interfaith dialogue, slightly detracts from the specific Christian perspective required in this context."
