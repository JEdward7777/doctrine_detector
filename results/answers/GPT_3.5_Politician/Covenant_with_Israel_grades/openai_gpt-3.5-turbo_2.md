Comment: The response effectively acknowledges the significance of the covenant between God and the Israelites by recognizing them as God's chosen people. It aligns with the concern by acknowledging the importance of God's promises and relationship with His chosen people from a Christian perspective. The only slight improvement could be to explicitly mention the central role of God's promises in the covenant relationship.
