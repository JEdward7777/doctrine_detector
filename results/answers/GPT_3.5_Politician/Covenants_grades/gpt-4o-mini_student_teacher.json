  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer accurately addresses how the promises in biblical covenants demonstrate God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture. However, the response could have been improved by specifically referencing the covenants with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as examples, in line with the given reference answer. Additionally, while the point about respecting religious beliefs is valid, it is not directly related to the question at hand, thus slightly impacting the overall coherence of the response."
