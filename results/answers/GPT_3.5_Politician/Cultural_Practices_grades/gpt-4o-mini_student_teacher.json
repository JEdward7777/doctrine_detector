  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 60. While the student touches on the importance of sensitivity and the complexity of interactions between Jewish and Gentile believers, there is a lack of specific information regarding the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and how they impacted early Christian practices. The response is more focused on generalities and lacks the specific historical context that is required to fully address the question. Additionally, there is a strong emphasis on respecting diversity, which is important but not directly addressing the question at hand. Further depth and specificity related to the cultural practices and their impact on early Christian practices would have improved the answer."
