However, the response could have strengthened its Christian worldview by explicitly referencing relevant Biblical teachings on inclusivity and acceptance, as well as highlighting how Jesus and early Christian leaders navigated interactions with individuals from different cultural backgrounds. A stronger integration of Christian principles would have elevated the response in addressing the concern more directly."
