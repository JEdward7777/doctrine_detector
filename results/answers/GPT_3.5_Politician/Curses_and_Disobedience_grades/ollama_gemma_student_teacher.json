  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a grasp of the concept of curses in Galatians 3:10 and its relationship to disobedience. However, it lacks specific textual references or interpretations that align with the Christian worldview. Additionally, the student's emphasis on sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives is appropriate but could be further elaborated to address the specific concern of disobedience to God's commands."
