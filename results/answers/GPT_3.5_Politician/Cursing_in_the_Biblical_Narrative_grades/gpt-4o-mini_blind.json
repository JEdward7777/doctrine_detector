  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response lacks depth and does not directly address the significance of the curse placed on the snake in Genesis 3:14 in relation to sin and redemption from a Christian perspective. While it is important to respect diverse viewpoints, in this context, a more focused and doctrinally sound explanation rooted in Christian theology would have been expected. The response demonstrates a lack of engagement with the specific question posed."
