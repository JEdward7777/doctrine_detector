  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely misses the mark in addressing the given question and concern. They do not engage with the theological implications of sin and redemption in the context of the curse on the snake in Genesis 3:14. Their answer lacks any Christian specific worldview or analysis. It is important for the student to focus on providing relevant and thoughtful responses in line with the question and concern provided."
