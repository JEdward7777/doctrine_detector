However, it could have delved deeper into the specific Christian beliefs regarding sin, redemption, and the role of Christ in salvation. The response could have also highlighted the centrality of Christ in the Christian worldview as the solution to the problem of sin, emphasizing the unique Christian perspective on redemption."
