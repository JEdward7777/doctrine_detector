  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 85. The student accurately states that the promise of David's throne lasting forever is fulfilled in Jesus as a descendant of David and emphasizes the eternal reign of Christ. The student also acknowledges the importance of this promise in Christian theology. However, the student could improve their answer by explicitly mentioning the significance of God's eternal covenant and sovereignty in connection to the promise of David's throne lasting forever, as highlighted in the reference answer. Strengthening this connection would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus."
