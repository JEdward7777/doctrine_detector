The connection between this promise, Jesus as the eternal king, and God's plan for humanity is well articulated. The importance of understanding this promise for recognizing the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus is clearly conveyed. Overall, a strong and insightful response from a Christian worldview perspective."
