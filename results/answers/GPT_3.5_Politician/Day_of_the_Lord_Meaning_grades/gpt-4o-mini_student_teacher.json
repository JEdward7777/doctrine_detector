  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively captures the core essence of the 'day of the Lord' as a time of divine judgment and intervention in the world, including the return of Jesus Christ and the final judgment. The student's response demonstrates a sound understanding of the concept, aligning well with the teacher's reference answer. A higher grade could be given if the student had elaborated more on the implications and significance of the 'day of the Lord' for believers based on a Christian worldview."
