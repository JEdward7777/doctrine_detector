  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a general understanding of the role of a deacon in the local church, emphasizing service and support for the congregation. However, from a Christian worldview, the primary role of a deacon as outlined in the Bible is to assist the elders in the church in practical matters so that the elders can focus on prayer and the ministry of the Word (Acts 6:1-7). The response lacks specific reference to this biblical mandate, which is central to the role of a deacon in the church. The answer could be improved by including scriptural support and emphasizing the importance of supporting and upholding the leadership of the church in the execution of their duties."
