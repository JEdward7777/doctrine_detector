  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60.\n\nWhile the student's response did touch on the aspect of serving the congregation and supporting their needs, they missed emphasizing the primary role of a deacon which is to specifically help fellow believers with practical needs such as food or money. The biblical perspective on the role of a deacon is rooted in the act of servanthood and prioritizing practical assistance to those in need. Therefore, the student's answer, while generally correct about serving the congregation, lacks a clear focus on the essential biblical aspect of servanthood as the primary role of a deacon."
