The primary role of a deacon in the local church is to serve the congregation and support the spiritual and practical needs of its members. Deacons often assist with various tasks such as providing care and support to individuals and families in need, helping to organize and implement community outreach programs, and assisting the pastor or clergy in the smooth functioning of the church services and activities. It is important to recognize and appreciate the valuable contributions that deacons make to the life of the church and the well-being of its members.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 60.

While the student's response did touch on the aspect of serving the congregation and supporting their needs, they missed emphasizing the primary role of a deacon which is to specifically help fellow believers with practical needs such as food or money. The biblical perspective on the role of a deacon is rooted in the act of servanthood and prioritizing practical assistance to those in need. Therefore, the student's answer, while generally correct about serving the congregation, lacks a clear focus on the essential biblical aspect of servanthood as the primary role of a deacon.
