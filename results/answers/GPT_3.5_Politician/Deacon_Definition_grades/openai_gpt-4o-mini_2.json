However, it would have been beneficial to also mention the spiritual aspect of a deacon's role in guiding and supporting members in their faith journey. By highlighting both the practical and spiritual dimensions of servanthood, the response would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the biblical role of a deacon in the church."
