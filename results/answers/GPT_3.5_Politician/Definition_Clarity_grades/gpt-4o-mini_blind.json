However, the answer could be improved by referencing specific Bible verses that address adultery, such as Exodus 20:14 or Matthew 5:27-28. Additionally, while it is important to approach sensitive topics with respect, the emphasis on sensitivity could potentially dilute the doctrinal clarity of the definition of adultery. A stronger emphasis on the biblical definition and consequences of adultery would enhance the response."
