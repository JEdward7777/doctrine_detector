Comment: The student's answer correctly identifies adultery as infidelity within marriage and acknowledges it as a sin, aligning with Christian beliefs. However, the student could have provided a more direct and specific reference to Scripture, such as citing the commandment "You shall not commit adultery" from Exodus 20:14. Additionally, expanding on the consequences or deeper implications of adultery according to Christian teachings would have further strengthened the response.
