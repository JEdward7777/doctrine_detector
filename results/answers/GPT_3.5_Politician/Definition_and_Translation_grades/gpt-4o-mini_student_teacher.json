  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80.\n\nComment: The student provided relevant alternative translations for the term 'intercede' that align well with the concept of intercession in Scripture. They demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and offered clear explanations for each alternative translation. However, the reference answer from the teacher offers a bit more nuanced translations that could enhance the student's response if included."
