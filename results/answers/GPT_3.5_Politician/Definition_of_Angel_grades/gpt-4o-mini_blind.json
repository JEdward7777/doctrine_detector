In a Christian worldview, angels are not just spiritual beings serving as messengers; they are created beings by God to serve Him, worship Him, and minister to believers. Their primary role is to worship and serve God, to protect His people, deliver messages, and execute His will. The answer could have been improved by focusing more on the biblical perspective of angels and their roles according to Christian teachings."
