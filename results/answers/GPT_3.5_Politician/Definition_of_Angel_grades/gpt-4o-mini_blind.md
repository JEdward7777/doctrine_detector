Comments: The answer provides a general overview of the concept of angels in various religious beliefs, but it lacks specificity to the biblical definition of angels and their primary role according to Christian doctrine. In a Christian worldview, angels are not just spiritual beings serving as messengers; they are created beings by God to serve Him, worship Him, and minister to believers. Their primary role is to worship and serve God, to protect His people, deliver messages, and execute His will. The answer could have been improved by focusing more on the biblical perspective of angels and their roles according to Christian teachings.
