  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a general understanding of the concept of angels as spiritual beings who serve as messengers and offer protection and guidance. However, the student's answer lacks specificity regarding the biblical definition of angels and their primary role according to Christian teachings. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into biblical references and Christian teachings on angels would strengthen their understanding and align it more closely with the Christian worldview."
