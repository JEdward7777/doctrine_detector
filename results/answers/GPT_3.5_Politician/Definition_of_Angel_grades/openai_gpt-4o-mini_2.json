It emphasizes their role in carrying out God's instructions and messages. The concern raised about understanding the role of angels deepening faith and providing assurance of God's protection aligns well with a Christian perspective. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a bit more about the significance of angels in facilitating communication between God and individuals."
