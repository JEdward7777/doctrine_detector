The Bible specifically defines a believer as someone who has faith in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior for the forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation. While it is important to acknowledge and respect different religious traditions, the focus of the question was on the biblical perspective of belief, which is centered on faith in Jesus Christ. Additional clarity on this essential aspect of Christian belief would improve the response."
