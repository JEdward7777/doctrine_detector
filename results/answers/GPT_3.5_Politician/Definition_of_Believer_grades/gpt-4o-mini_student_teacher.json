  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a broad definition of a believer, encompassing various faith traditions, but fails to specifically address the Christian perspective delineated in the reference answer. While acknowledging diverse beliefs is important, in the context of a Christian worldview, a believer is specifically someone who believes in and accepts Jesus Christ as their Savior. The student's response overlooks this crucial aspect."
