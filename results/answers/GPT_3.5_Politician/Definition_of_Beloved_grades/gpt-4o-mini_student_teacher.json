  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer accurately describes the general meaning of the term \"beloved\" in a biblical context but fails to specifically address the depth of God's love for Jesus and its connection to believers. To improve the answer, the student could have delved deeper into how the term 'beloved' reflects the profound love between God and Jesus, which serves as a model for believers to understand and emulate in their own relationships with God."
