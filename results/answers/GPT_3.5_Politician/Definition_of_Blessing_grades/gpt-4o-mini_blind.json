It correctly highlights blessings as gestures of goodwill, kindness, and prayer for the well-being and success of others in the Christian faith. It could be strengthened by also mentioning the biblical basis for blessing others, such as the examples of God blessing His people in the Old Testament and Jesus blessing others in the New Testament."
