Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately identifies the New Testament definition of "church" as a community of believers in Jesus Christ, specifically mentioning it as a local assembly of believers. However, it lacks depth in addressing the concern about understanding the church's role as more than just a building. Expanding on how the church is a spiritual body and the importance of community beyond physical structures would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
