  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately explains that in the New Testament, \"church\" refers to all people who believe in Jesus, often meeting as a local assembly. It acknowledges the importance of believers coming together. The concern about understanding the church's role as more than just a building is not directly addressed in the response, hence a slight deduction in points. However, the response maintains a solid Christian perspective on the concept of the church."
