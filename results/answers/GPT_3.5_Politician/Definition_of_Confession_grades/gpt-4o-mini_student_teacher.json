  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of confession in the context of the Bible by emphasizing acknowledging sins, seeking forgiveness, and the significance of confession in the Christian faith. However, the reference answer provided a more concise definition of confession, encompassing both aspects of confessing the truth about God and admitting one's sins. The student could have further elaborated on the aspect of confessing the truth about God in their response to align more closely with the biblical context."
