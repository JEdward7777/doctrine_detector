  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the general meaning of confession as admitting or asserting the truth, which can apply to both acknowledging God's truth and admitting one's sins. However, it lacks depth in specifically addressing the biblical context of confession within a Christian worldview, such as referencing key biblical passages on confession, the role of confession in salvation through Christ, or the importance of confession in the Christian life. More integration of biblical foundations would have strengthened the response further."
