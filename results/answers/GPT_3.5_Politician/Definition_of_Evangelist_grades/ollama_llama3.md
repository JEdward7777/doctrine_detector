Comment: The response provides a good understanding of the literal meaning of "evangelist" as "someone who preaches the good news." It also correctly references the Greek term "euangelistes" and its connection to sharing the gospel. However, while it mentions the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel, it could be further developed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this role within the context of Christian discipleship.
