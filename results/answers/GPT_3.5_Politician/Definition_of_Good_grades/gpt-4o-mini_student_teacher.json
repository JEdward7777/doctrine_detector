  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear alignment with the Biblical definition of 'good' and 'evil'. While it is important to respect diverse beliefs, the response missed the opportunity to address the moral implications of these concepts in daily decision-making from a Christian worldview. The student's focus on sensitivity and understanding is commendable, but a stronger connection to the Biblical perspective on 'good' and 'evil' is needed for a higher grade."
