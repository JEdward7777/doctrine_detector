It disregards the objective standards of good and evil set forth in the Bible and instead focuses on subjective and diverse viewpoints. The Biblical definition of 'good' and 'evil' as morally right and wrong is essential for shaping ethical decision-making, which is not clearly emphasized in the response. The importance of aligning personal beliefs and actions with Biblical principles is crucial in evaluating moral choices in daily life."
