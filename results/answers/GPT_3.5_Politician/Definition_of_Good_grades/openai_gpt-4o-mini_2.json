However, the concern raised about understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making was not directly addressed in the initial response. The response could have been improved by connecting the Christian perspective on 'good' and 'evil' to the importance of understanding and applying these principles in daily decision-making."
