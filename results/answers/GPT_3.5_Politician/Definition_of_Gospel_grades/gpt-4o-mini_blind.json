However, the response could be improved by emphasizing the centrality of the gospel to Christian faith and highlighting its significance as the core message of Christianity, rather than blending it with various interpretations from different religious and cultural contexts. Additionally, incorporating scriptural references to support the understanding of the gospel would strengthen the answer."
