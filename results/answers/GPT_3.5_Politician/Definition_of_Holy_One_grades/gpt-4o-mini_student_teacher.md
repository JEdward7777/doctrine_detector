Grade: 70

Comment: The student's answer provides a generally accurate understanding of the term "Holy One" in the Bible, acknowledging its significance in emphasizing God's purity and divine nature. However, there is a deviation from the specific concern of highlighting God's unique role in Scripture, as the reference answer points out the consistent reference of 'Holy One' to God, particularly in the context of the 'Holy One of Israel' and Jesus. The reference to individuals striving for righteousness, while valid in some contexts, does not fully capture the primary focus on God's holiness. The student could improve by focusing more on God's unique and central role as the "Holy One" in Scripture.
