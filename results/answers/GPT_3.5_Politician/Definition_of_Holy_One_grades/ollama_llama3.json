  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible, correctly identifying its primary reference to God and emphasizing His holiness. However, it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or biblical references to support this claim. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the importance of understanding God's holiness, it does not directly address the concern about God's unique role in scripture.\n\nThe main areas where the response falls short are:\n\n1. Lack of specificity: The response could benefit from more concrete examples or biblical references to illustrate the concept of \"Holy One\" and its significance.\n2. Limited scope: While the response correctly identifies God as the primary referent for \"Holy One\", it does not explore other possible meanings or applications of this term, such as its use in reference to individuals who are devoted to God.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation, but could be improved by providing more detail and exploring the concept further."
