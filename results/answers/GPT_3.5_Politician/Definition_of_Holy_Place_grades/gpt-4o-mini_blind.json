The answer did not address the specific biblical and theological significance of the holy place in Christian theology, such as its representation of God's presence, access to God through sacrifice and worship, and the foreshadowing of Christ as the ultimate mediator. More specific references to Scripture and Christian teachings would have enhanced the response."
