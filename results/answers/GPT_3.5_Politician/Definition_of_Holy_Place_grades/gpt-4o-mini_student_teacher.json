  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response touches on the general significance of a holy place in religious traditions, but it lacks specificity in the context of the tabernacle or temple. The answer does not directly address the design and function of God's dwelling place in relation to the 'holy place' as outlined in the reference answer. More focus on the specific elements within the holy place of the tabernacle or temple would have strengthened the response."
