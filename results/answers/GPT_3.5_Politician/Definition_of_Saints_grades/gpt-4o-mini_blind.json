However, it would have been beneficial to emphasize the biblical basis for the term \"saints\" as believers who are sanctified through faith in Christ, as articulated in various passages such as Ephesians 1:1 and Colossians 1:2. Additionally, the response could have underscored the role of saints in exemplifying virtues and serving as models for other believers to follow. Overall, a good explanation with room for deeper doctrinal exploration."
