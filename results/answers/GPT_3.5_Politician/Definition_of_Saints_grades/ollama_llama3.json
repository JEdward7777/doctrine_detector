  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that \"saints\" refers to individuals deemed holy or set apart by their faith, which aligns with the correct Biblical definition. However, it also goes beyond the original definition by including concepts like piety, compassion, and service to others, which are not necessarily explicitly stated in the Bible. Additionally, while it does mention that different Christian denominations have varying interpretations of saints, it does not fully address the concern of distinguishing between cultural and scriptural interpretations.\n\nThe comment on this grade is: This response partially addresses the concern by mentioning the variation among denominations, but could be strengthened by providing a more explicit and biblical definition of saints."
