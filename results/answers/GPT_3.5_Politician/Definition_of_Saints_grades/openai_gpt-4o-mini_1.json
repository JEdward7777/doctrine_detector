  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the term \"saints\" based on its literal meaning and its Biblical context. It correctly emphasizes the importance of understanding the scriptural definition of saints to differentiate it from cultural interpretations. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how living a life of piety, compassion, and service to others aligns with the Biblical concept of saints."
