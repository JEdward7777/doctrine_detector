It correctly includes the aspect of being purified and living in accordance with faith teachings. However, it could be improved by emphasizing the crucial role of the Holy Spirit in the sanctification process and the need for surrendering to God's will for true sanctification to occur. Furthermore, mentioning the importance of Christ's sacrifice and our union with Him for sanctification could enhance the answer."
