The explanation is clear and concise, providing a good overview of the concept's meaning and implications. However, while it touches on the idea that sanctification can refer to spiritual and moral purification, it does not fully develop this point or explore its significance in Christian living. A slightly more detailed and nuanced discussion would elevate the response to an even higher score."
