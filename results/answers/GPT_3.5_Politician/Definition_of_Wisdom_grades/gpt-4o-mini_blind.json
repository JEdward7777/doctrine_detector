  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response at 85. The student provides a solid explanation of biblical wisdom by emphasizing the connection to God's will, making good choices, and gaining wisdom through experience and seeking guidance from God. However, to enhance the answer, they could have included references to specific biblical passages that define and illustrate wisdom, such as Proverbs and James. Additionally, a brief mention of the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom, as stated in Proverbs 9:10, would have added depth to the explanation."
