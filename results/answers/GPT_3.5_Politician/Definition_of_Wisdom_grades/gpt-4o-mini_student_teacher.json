  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student's answer aligns well with the biblical definition of wisdom by emphasizing understanding God's will, making good choices, having discernment, gaining wisdom through experience and reflection, and seeking guidance from God. The student's answer could be improved by further emphasizing the importance of aligning with God's moral standards and practicing what is morally right, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of biblical wisdom, but could enhance their response by incorporating more emphasis on aligning with God's moral standards."
