The answer could be improved by incorporating key biblical elements such as belief in Jesus as the Son of God, the importance of faith and salvation through Him, and the concept of following His teachings as outlined in the Bible. Additionally, while acknowledging diversity is valid, it is important to prioritize biblical accuracy in defining foundational Christian terms."
