  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer correctly mentions that a Christian follows the teachings of Jesus Christ and seeks to live according to Christian principles, which aligns with biblical teachings to an extent. However, the answer lacks emphasizing the core belief that a Christian is someone who believes in Jesus as the Son of God and trusts Him for salvation, which is essential in defining a Christian from a biblical standpoint. The student could improve by incorporating this crucial aspect of faith into their definition."
