However, it lacks depth and fails to offer a Christian-specific perspective on the topic. The mention of respecting diverse beliefs is commendable in a general sense, but for a Christian worldview, it is essential to emphasize the uniqueness of Christ's miracles and their role in revealing God's authority, particularly in the context of Christian theology. More clarity and specificity in relation to Christian beliefs on miracles and God's authority would improve the response."
