  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a general understanding of miracles and their relation to God's authority but failed to fully articulate the Christian worldview perspective. The response lacked depth in explaining how miracles specifically demonstrate God's authority and power in a Christian context. Additionally, the inclusion of personal beliefs unrelated to the Christian view detracted from the focus on faith and acknowledgment of God's power. Overall, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian perspective on miracles and God's authority."
