  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of a miracle and its relationship to God's authority. It provides a concise definition of a miracle and acknowledges the diversity of beliefs regarding miracles across different traditions. However, the answer could benefit from a deeper exploration of the significance of miracles in strengthening faith and acknowledging God's power. Additionally, the reference to respecting the diversity of beliefs is appropriate for a political context but may not fully address the concern related to the student's own faith perspective."
