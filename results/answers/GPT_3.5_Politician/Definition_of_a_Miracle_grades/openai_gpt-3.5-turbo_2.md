## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Miracle.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
A miracle is often described as an extraordinary or supernatural event that is believed to be caused by divine intervention or a higher power. In many religious traditions, miracles are seen as manifestations of God's authority and power, as they are seen as evidence of the presence and influence of a higher being in the world.

It is important to note that beliefs about miracles and their relationship to God's authority can vary widely among different religious and spiritual traditions. As a politician, I respect the diversity of beliefs regarding miracles and God's authority, and I strive to maintain a respectful and inclusive approach to discussing these topics.
