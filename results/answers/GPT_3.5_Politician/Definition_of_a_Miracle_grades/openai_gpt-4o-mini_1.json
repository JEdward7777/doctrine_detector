However, the concern highlighted the importance of understanding miracles in deepening faith and acknowledging God's power, which was not directly addressed in the response. While the response acknowledges the variations in beliefs regarding miracles, it could have further emphasized the significance of miracles in strengthening faith and recognizing God's power, aligning better with the Christian worldview."
