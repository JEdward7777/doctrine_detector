Comment: The answer provides a basic understanding of who the "people of God" are in the Old Testament by identifying them as the Israelites, chosen by God for a special relationship. However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the theological significance of being the chosen people of God and the responsibilities and promises that come with that designation. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to emphasize the unique covenant relationship between God and the Israelites as portrayed in the Old Testament. Overall, while the answer is somewhat accurate, it lacks depth and theological insight.
