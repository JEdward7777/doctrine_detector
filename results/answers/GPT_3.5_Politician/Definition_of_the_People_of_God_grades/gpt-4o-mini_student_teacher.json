  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Based on the concern provided about understanding the covenant relationship God established with Israel, the student's answer falls short in accurately addressing this specific aspect. While the student correctly identifies the Israelites as the 'people of God' in the Old Testament and hints at their special relationship with God, they miss addressing the covenant aspect explicitly. The reference answer from the teacher emphasizes the chosen and set-apart nature of Israel by God, which ties directly to the covenant relationship. \n\nTherefore, I would grade the student's response at 65. While they touch on the main points, the lack of explicit reference to the covenant relationship established by God with Israel is a significant omission in light of the specified concern."
