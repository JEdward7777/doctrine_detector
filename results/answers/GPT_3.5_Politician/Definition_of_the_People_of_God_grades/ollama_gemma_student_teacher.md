**Comment:** 
The student's answer correctly identifies the Israelites as the primary reference for the "people of God" in the Old Testament. They also acknowledge the special relationship God established with this nation, which aligns with the teacher's reference concern. 

However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the nature of this covenant relationship between God and Israel, specifically mentioning obedience and service as key aspects of that relationship. Additionally, while mentioning the importance of sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs is commendable, it would be beneficial to elaborate on how this applies to understanding the concept of the "people of God" within a Christian worldview.
