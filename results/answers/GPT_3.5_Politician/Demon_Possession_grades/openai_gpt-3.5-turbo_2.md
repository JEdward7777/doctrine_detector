However, the response lacks a clear Christian perspective on the nature of spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ, which are important components within a Christian worldview. It is essential to emphasize the power and authority of Jesus Christ in overcoming demonic influences. Further elaboration on these aspects from a Christian perspective would strengthen the response.
