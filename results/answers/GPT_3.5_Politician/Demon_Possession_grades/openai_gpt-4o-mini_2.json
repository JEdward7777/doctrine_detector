However, the initial response lacks a strong affirmation of the Christian belief in the reality of demon possession and the importance of seeking deliverance through Jesus Christ. Encouragement to emphasize the biblical teachings on spiritual warfare and deliverance would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
