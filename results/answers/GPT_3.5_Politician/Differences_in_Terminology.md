## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
Certainly! While all three terms involve some level of prompting or urging someone to take a particular action or behave in a certain way, there are subtle differences in their connotations.

1. "Exhort": To exhort means to strongly urge or persuade someone to do something, often for their own benefit or to reach a common goal. It conveys a sense of passionate encouragement or motivation.

2. "Encourage": To encourage means to give someone support, confidence, or hope in their abilities or efforts. It is a more general term that can encompass a range of positive reinforcements.

3. "Admonish": To admonish means to caution, reprimand, or warn someone about their behavior or actions, often with a sense of disapproval or correction. It implies a more serious tone than simply offering encouragement.

In summary, while "exhort" and "encourage" generally have positive connotations, "admonish" tends to have a more negative or corrective connotation. It's important to consider the context and tone in which these words are used to avoid any misunderstanding or offense.
