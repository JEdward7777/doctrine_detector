They have correctly identified the nuanced differences in connotations for each term and have effectively communicated how each word is used in context. The explanation aligns well with a Christian worldview by highlighting the importance of understanding the tone and intent behind these actions, especially when it comes to offering correction or admonishment. Well done!"
