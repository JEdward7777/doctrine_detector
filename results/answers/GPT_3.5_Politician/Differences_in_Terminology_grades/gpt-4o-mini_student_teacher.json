  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the key differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish', highlighting their nuances effectively. The student's response aligns well with the reference answer, but there is a slight deviation in the explanation of \"exhort\" and \"encourage.\" While the student correctly emphasizes the positive connotations of 'exhort' and 'encourage', they could have more explicitly tied these definitions to doing what is right (exhort) and inspiring/comforting (encourage) as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and well-reasoned response with a solid biblical perspective."
