  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student's answer is close, but not entirely accurate. They correctly identify that \"exhort\" involves encouraging someone to do what is right, but their definition of \"encourage\" as simply inspiring or comforting doesn't capture the full range of positive reinforcements that the term can entail. Additionally, their definition of \"admonish\" as warning or correcting someone for wrong behavior is correct, but it's worth noting that scripture often uses admonition to correct and guide believers in their walk with God.\n\nThe student does a good job of summarizing the general connotations of each word and providing some examples of how they might be used. However, their answer doesn't explicitly connect these definitions back to scriptural principles or guidelines for using encouragement effectively. For example, they could have noted that scripture often exhorts believers to persevere in faith (e.g., Hebrews 10:36), encourages them with promises of God's presence and power (e.g., Psalm 23:4), and admonishes them to avoid sin and its consequences (e.g., Romans 6:12-14).\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the general meanings of these words, but could benefit from further exploration of how they might be applied in light of scriptural principles."
