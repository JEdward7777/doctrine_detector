  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed explanation of the differences between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" based on their connotations and implications. It effectively clarifies the appropriate use of these forms of encouragement with consideration for a Christian worldview, recognizing the nuances of positive and corrective connotations in light of scriptural guidance on supporting and correcting others. The only slight improvement would be to include more direct reference or examples from scripture to further strengthen the connection to a Christian worldview."
