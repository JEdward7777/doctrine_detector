The primary reason for their selection was not merely to establish diversity and inclusivity, but rather to fulfill specific roles in spreading the Gospel message and building the foundation of the early church. Additionally, while unity and harmony are important principles, they were not the sole reasons for the selection of the twelve apostles. The answer should have focused more on their role in proclaiming the Kingdom of God and carrying on the ministry of Jesus."
