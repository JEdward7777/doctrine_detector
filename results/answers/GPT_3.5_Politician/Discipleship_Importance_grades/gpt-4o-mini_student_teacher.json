However, the student's response lacks a crucial aspect: the specific role of the apostles in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church. Understanding the apostles' central role in the New Testament narrative is essential in comprehending their significance. The student's answer could be improved by emphasizing the apostles' specific call and mission as chosen by Jesus."
