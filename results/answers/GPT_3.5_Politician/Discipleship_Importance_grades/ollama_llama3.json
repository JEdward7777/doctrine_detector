  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of highlighting the diversity and inclusivity of the apostles, which is an important aspect of Jesus' mission. It also mentions the importance of unity and harmony among people, which is consistent with Jesus' teachings in the New Testament. The response also shows some understanding of the role of the apostles in establishing the early Church.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly state that the apostles were chosen to spread Jesus' teachings, which is a key aspect of their role according to the New Testament. Additionally, while it mentions unity and harmony among people, it does not specifically connect this to the apostles' role in building the early Christian community.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of some aspects of the apostles' significance in the New Testament, but could be more detailed and specific in its explanation.\n\nComment: While the response is strong in its emphasis on diversity and inclusivity, it would benefit from a more explicit connection to Jesus' teachings and the role of the apostles in building the early Church."
