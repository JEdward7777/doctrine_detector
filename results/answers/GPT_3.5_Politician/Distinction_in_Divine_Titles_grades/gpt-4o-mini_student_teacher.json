  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student correctly emphasizes the importance of respect and accuracy in translating religious texts, showing sensitivity to the significance of the term 'Lord Yahweh'. However, there is a slight deviation from the concern provided, as the student focused more on potential confusion and offense to beliefs rather than specifically addressing how maintaining clarity in translations prevents misinterpretations concerning God's identity and authority."
