It acknowledges the potential confusion that could arise from using 'Lord LORD' and emphasizes the significance of accurately conveying the intended meaning to avoid misunderstanding. The only slight improvement could be to explicitly connect the importance of clarity in translations with the Christian belief in acknowledging and respecting the divine identity of 'Lord Yahweh'."
