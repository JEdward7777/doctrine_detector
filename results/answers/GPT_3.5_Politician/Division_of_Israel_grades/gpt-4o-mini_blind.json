  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The answer correctly identifies the division of the kingdom into Israel and Judah as a major event in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign. However, to improve the grade, the response could have mentioned the underlying spiritual reasons for this division, such as disobedience to God and the consequences of idolatry, which ultimately led to the downfall of both kingdoms. Additionally, referencing specific biblical passages that detail this event would have further strengthened the answer."
