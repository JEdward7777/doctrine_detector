Grade: 90

Comment: The student accurately identified the major event of the division of the kingdom into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah after King Solomon's reign. However, there could have been more emphasis on the spiritual significance of this division from a Christian worldview, such as how it fulfilled God's prophecy or how it reflected the consequences of turning away from God.
