Grade: 60

Comment: The response partially addresses the concern of recognizing Christ's authority, but it only scratches the surface. While it mentions Jesus' dominion as one of love, compassion, and justice, it does not explicitly highlight His authority in all aspects of life. Additionally, the response focuses more on Jesus' character and role as a unifying force rather than emphasizing His supreme authority. However, the fact that it acknowledges Christ's reign over all the earth shows some understanding of His dominion. To improve this response, it would be beneficial to explicitly tie Jesus' dominion to His authority in all aspects of life and demonstrate how this impacts our faith.
