Comment: The response acknowledges the diversity of beliefs, which is important. However, it fails to provide a clear answer regarding the duration of the "last days" according to the Bible from a Christian perspective. It would have been beneficial to mention key biblical passages or theological viewpoints that offer insights into the timing or nature of the "last days" in the Christian faith. Emphasizing doctrinal clarity is essential in addressing theological questions.
