  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by acknowledging that uncertainty can exist regarding the timing and duration of \"the last days\". However, it does not directly address how Christians should live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return due to this uncertainty. The response also focuses more on respecting diversity of beliefs rather than offering a biblical perspective on the issue.\n\nA higher score would require a more explicit discussion of the implications of uncertainty for Christian living and a more scriptural approach to understanding \"the last days\"."
