Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the duration of 'the last days,' which is in line with Christian teachings that emphasize faith and readiness for Christ's return. However, it lacks a strong emphasis on the importance of living out one's faith in anticipation of this event. Encouraging Christians to remain diligent in their faith and service while awaiting Christ's return would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
