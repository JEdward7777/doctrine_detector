  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the duration of \"the last days,\" which is aligned with Christian humility and acceptance of God's timing. However, it lacks a clear connection to how this uncertainty can impact how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. To improve the grade, it would have been beneficial to offer insights on how Christians can navigate this uncertainty in their daily lives and spiritual preparation."
