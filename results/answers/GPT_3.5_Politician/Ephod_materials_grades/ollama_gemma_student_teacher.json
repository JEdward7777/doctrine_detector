  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly states that the ephod was traditionally made from fine linen, gold, and other precious materials. However, it lacks the specific detail of the gold embroidery mentioned in the reference answer. While the student's answer adequately addresses the materials used, it doesn't fully capture the significance of the embroidery in terms of design and symbolism."
