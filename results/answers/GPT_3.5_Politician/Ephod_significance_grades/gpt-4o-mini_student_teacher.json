They correctly highlighted its representation of the priest's sacred role and authority in leading worship and seeking guidance from God. Additionally, they emphasized the ephod as a symbol of mediation and unity among the tribes of Israel. While the student's response aligned well with the teacher's reference answer, there was a slight oversight in not mentioning the specific use of the Urim and Thummim attached to the ephod for discerning God's will, which is an important aspect of the ephod's significance in Old Testament worship."
