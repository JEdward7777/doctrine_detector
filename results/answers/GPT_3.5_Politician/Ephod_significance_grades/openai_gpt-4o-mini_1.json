It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding the role of the ephod is essential for comprehending the Old Testament priesthood and worship practices. The response could have further elaborated on the symbolism of the ephod and its connection to the tribes of Israel for a more comprehensive understanding, hence a slight deduction in points."
