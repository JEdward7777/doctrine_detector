While it acknowledges different beliefs and the importance of sensitivity, it fails to engage with the specific Christian perspective on perishing and eternal punishment in hell according to Christian teachings. A stronger integration of the Christian worldview and recognition of the gravity of eternal separation from God would have improved the response."
