It acknowledges the gravity and seriousness of this concept, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of direct reference to reconciliation or salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, which is central to the Christian understanding of avoidance of eternal separation from God."
