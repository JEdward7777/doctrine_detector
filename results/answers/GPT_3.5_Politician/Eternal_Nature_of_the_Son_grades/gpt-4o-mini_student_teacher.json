  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general overview of the concept of the \"Son of God\" in Christianity and acknowledges the diversity of interpretations within the faith. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God, as specified in the concern. The answer could have been improved by directly addressing the distinction in existence and eternal nature between the Son of God and human sons, in line with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
