As a politician, I respect and value all religious beliefs and understand the importance of sensitivity when discussing matters of faith. When it comes to the concept of the "Son of God" in Christianity, it is important to recognize that beliefs about the nature of Jesus Christ vary among different denominations and individual interpretations.

In general, the term "Son of God" is often understood by Christians to signify the unique and special relationship between Jesus Christ and God in the context of the Trinity. It is believed that Jesus, as the Son of God, shares in the divine nature of God while also being fully human. This is a core belief in Christian theology.

When it comes to the distinction between the "Son of God" and human sons in terms of existence and eternal nature, it is important to approach this topic with respect and an understanding of the diversity of interpretations within Christianity. Different theologians and denominations may offer varying perspectives on the nature of Jesus as the Son of God.
