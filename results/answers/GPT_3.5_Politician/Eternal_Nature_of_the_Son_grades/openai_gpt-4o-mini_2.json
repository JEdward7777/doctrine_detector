The mention of Jesus being active in the creation of the world aligns with the Christian worldview of Jesus as part of the Trinity and His eternal nature. The response could further strengthen the connection between the eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God and the significance of this belief for Christians' understanding of the divinity of Christ."
