Grade: 30

Comment: The student's answer completely avoids addressing the specific Christian concept of eternal punishment in hell and how it reflects God's justice. As a Christian perspective was required in the response, the student's focus on promoting understanding of diverse beliefs and values of compassion falls short of providing a relevant and adequate answer within a Christian worldview.
