**Comment:** While the student's response demonstrates respect and awareness of diverse perspectives, it avoids engaging with the specific concern of the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. The response would be stronger if it addressed the connection between the concept of eternal punishment and God's justice from a Christian perspective.
