However, the response avoids taking a clear stance on this specific Christian belief and instead focuses on promoting understanding and respect for diverse beliefs, which may dilute the Christian worldview in this context. More emphasis on the importance of recognizing God's justice and mercy within the Christian framework could strengthen the Christian-specific perspective in addressing the concern provided."
