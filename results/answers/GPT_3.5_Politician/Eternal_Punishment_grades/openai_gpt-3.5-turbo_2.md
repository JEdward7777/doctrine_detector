Grade: 80

Comment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian belief regarding eternal punishment in hell and the theological concept of divine justice in response to rejection of God's salvation. However, the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences is not directly addressed in the politician's response. While the politician shows respect for differing beliefs, a more direct engagement with the concern from a Christian worldview could have strengthened the response.
