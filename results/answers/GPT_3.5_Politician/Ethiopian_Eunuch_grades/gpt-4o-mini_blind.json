However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the theological significance of the encounter, specifically how it relates to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the inclusion of Gentiles in the Kingdom of God. Additionally, the mention of the transformative power of the Gospel in the eunuch's life would have further enriched the answer."
