  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has correctly identified the significance of inclusiveness and acceptance in the encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch in the early church. However, the student's response lacks the specific mention of the extension of the Gospel to Gentiles, which is a key aspect emphasized in the reference answer. It is important to highlight the broader theological implications of this encounter in the context of the early church's mission to include individuals from diverse backgrounds."
