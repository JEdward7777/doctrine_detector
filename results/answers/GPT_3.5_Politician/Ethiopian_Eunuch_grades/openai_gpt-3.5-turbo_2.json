It demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian belief in God's acceptance of all who believe, regardless of their background. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into the specific aspects of inclusiveness and the diverse backgrounds of individuals in the early church, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern provided."
