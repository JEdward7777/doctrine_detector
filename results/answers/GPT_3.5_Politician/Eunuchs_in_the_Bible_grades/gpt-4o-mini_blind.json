However, it lacks depth and does not delve into the theological implications and significance of Jesus' words regarding eunuchs. The response also sidesteps the specific Christian perspective on celibacy and falls short in highlighting the spiritual reasons behind the choice of celibacy for the sake of the kingdom of God as mentioned by Jesus. It's important to emphasize the biblical context and implications of celibacy as well as address any potential misunderstandings or misinterpretations that may arise."
