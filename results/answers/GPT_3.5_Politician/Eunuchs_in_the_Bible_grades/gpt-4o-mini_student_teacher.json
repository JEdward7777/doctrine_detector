  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a relatively accurate understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy as it relates to Jesus' words in Matthew 19:12. Their explanation of the three types of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus was good, but there is room for improvement in connecting the concept of celibacy more directly to the passage. Additionally, the student's response lacked depth in exploring the deeper significance and implications of celibacy in Christianity. Encouragement to delve deeper into the theological implications and significance of celibacy within a Christian worldview would enhance their answer."
