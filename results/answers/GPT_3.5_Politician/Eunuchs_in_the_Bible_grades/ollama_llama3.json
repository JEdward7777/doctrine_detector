  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response successfully addresses the concern of understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy, accurately referencing Matthew 19:12 and highlighting Jesus' threefold classification of eunuchs. The writer also shows sensitivity to diverse perspectives on celibacy and emphasizes the importance of respecting individuals' choices.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are minor and mainly related to clarity and expansion. For instance, the response could have further explored the implications of Jesus' teaching on celibacy, particularly in light of the cultural context at the time. Additionally, the writer could have provided more specific examples or biblical references to illustrate their points. Overall, however, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy and its various forms."
