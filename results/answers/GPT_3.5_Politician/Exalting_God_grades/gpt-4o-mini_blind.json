The answer does not specifically address the biblical concept of exalting God through obedience, worship, prayer, and glorifying Him in all aspects of life. The focus on diversity and sensitivity is commendable, but in a Christian worldview, exalting God involves a personal relationship with Him through Jesus Christ and living according to His Word. The response could benefit from incorporating key Christian beliefs and practices when discussing the concept of exalting God in daily life."
