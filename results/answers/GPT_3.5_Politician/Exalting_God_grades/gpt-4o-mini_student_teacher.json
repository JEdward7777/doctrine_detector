  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the Christian-specific perspective needed to fully address the importance of exalting God above all else in life. While promoting inclusivity and respect for all beliefs is important, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on worship, prayer, and living according to God's will as central to exalting God in daily life from a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to incorporate specific Christian teachings and practices into their response would enhance clarity and depth."
