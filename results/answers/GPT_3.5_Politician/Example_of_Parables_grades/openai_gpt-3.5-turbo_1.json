The explanation demonstrates an understanding of the moral lesson embedded in Jesus' parables and effectively connects it to the relevance of applying those principles in present-day contexts. The response could have been further enhanced by providing specific examples of how the lessons from the Good Samaritan parable can be applied in contemporary society."
