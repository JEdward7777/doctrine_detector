# Answer by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
Certainly! One example of a parable told by Jesus is the Parable of the Good Samaritan. In this story, a man is robbed, beaten, and left for dead on the side of the road. Several people pass by, including a priest and a Levite, who both ignore the man and continue on their way. However, a Samaritan, who was considered an outsider and often looked down upon by the Jewish people, stops to help the man. He tends to his wounds, takes him to an inn, and pays for his care.

The significance of this parable is to emphasize the importance of showing compassion and mercy to all people, regardless of their background, ethnicity, or social status. Jesus was challenging his listeners to broaden their definition of "neighbor" and to treat others with kindness and love, even if they are different from us. This parable teaches us the value of empathy, generosity, and reaching out to those in need, no matter who they are.
