The concern highlights the importance of acknowledging and engaging with spiritual realities as revealed in the Bible, which this response somewhat avoided. Encouragement to discuss the topic with sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs could have still been included while also highlighting the significance of addressing spiritual issues within the Christian worldview."
