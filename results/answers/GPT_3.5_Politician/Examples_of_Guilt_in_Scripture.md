## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
One example from the Bible that demonstrates the concept of guilt is the story of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis. After they disobeyed God by eating the forbidden fruit, they felt guilty and tried to hide from God. This story shows how guilt can arise from wrongdoing and the consequences it can have on individuals.

Another example is the story of King David and Bathsheba. David's guilt over his affair with Bathsheba and the subsequent murder of her husband, Uriah, is evident throughout the narrative. He eventually confesses his sins and seeks forgiveness, illustrating how guilt can lead to repentance and a desire to make amends.

These examples highlight the complex nature of guilt as a moral and emotional response to our actions, as depicted in the Bible.
