  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe answer provides two relevant examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt \u2013 Adam and Eve's disobedience leading to guilt and King David's guilt over his sins of adultery and murder. The student effectively explains how guilt can arise from wrongdoing and the impact it can have on individuals. The reference to seeking forgiveness and repentance aligns with Christian teachings on the response to guilt. However, to improve the answer, the student could have further explored the theological implications of guilt in relation to redemption and the atonement. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological reflection."
