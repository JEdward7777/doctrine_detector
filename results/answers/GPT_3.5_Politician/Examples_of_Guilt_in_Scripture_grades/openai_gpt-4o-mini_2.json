  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides relevant examples from the Bible that effectively demonstrate the concept of guilt in the context of justice and innocence. The examples of Pilate declaring Jesus innocent and the robber acknowledging their guilt compared to Jesus in Luke 23:41 align well with the concern provided, highlighting the need for divine judgment. The connection between guilt, justice, innocence, and divine judgment is clearly articulated with strong biblical references. Overall, this response demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian worldview on guilt and its implications in the context of justice and divine judgment."
