  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 80. The student provided a comprehensive list of specific miracles performed by Jesus and discussed their significance in demonstrating his divine nature and authority. They also acknowledged the variations in interpretations among different Christian denominations, showing awareness of differing perspectives within the faith. However, the answer could have been strengthened by more directly tying the miracles to the significance of recognizing Jesus as the Son of God, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student showed a solid understanding of the topic but could have connected the miracles more explicitly to the stated concern."
