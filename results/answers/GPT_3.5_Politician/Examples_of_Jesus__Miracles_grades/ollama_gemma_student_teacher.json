  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of Jesus' miracles in Christian belief. They provide specific examples of miracles attributed to Jesus and explain their significance. However, the response could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the significance of these miracles, particularly in relation to the Christian worldview. Additionally, the student's answer does not include any reference to the teacher's provided examples of calming a storm, healing a blind man, and raising people from the dead."
