  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85%\n\nComment: The response accurately lists some of Jesus' most significant miracles, including calming a storm, healing a blind man, and raising people from the dead. These examples are all mentioned in the provided answer, and they serve as signs of Jesus' divinity and God's kingdom, which aligns with the concern about recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the response doesn't explicitly connect these specific miracles to Jesus being the Son of God. While it mentions the importance of recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in helping our belief in Him, it doesn't directly demonstrate this understanding through a detailed explanation of the miracles.\n\nOverall, the response does a great job of highlighting some of Jesus' most important and well-known miracles, but could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern about recognizing their significance."
