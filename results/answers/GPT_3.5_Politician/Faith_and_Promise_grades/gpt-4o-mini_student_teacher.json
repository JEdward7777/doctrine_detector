  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear explanation of the role of faith in receiving and trusting God's promises, especially as shown in the example of Abram. The answer mostly focuses on the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and viewpoints rather than delving into the specific relationship between faith and God's promises. Encouraging further explanation and application of Biblical examples would significantly improve the answer."
