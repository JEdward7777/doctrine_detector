The explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of these concepts within Christianity. However, it could have been strengthened by incorporating more specific biblical references or theological depth to support the discussion of trust and faith in Christian belief. Further elaboration on how trust and faith work together in the Christian walk would have enhanced the overall response."
