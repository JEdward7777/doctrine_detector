The answer is concise, well-organized, and provides relevant examples from scripture and tradition. However, the student could benefit from providing more specific examples of how trust and faith are demonstrated in the lives of Christians. Additionally, the student's conclusion could be strengthened by providing a broader perspective on the importance of both trust and faith in the Christian worldview."
