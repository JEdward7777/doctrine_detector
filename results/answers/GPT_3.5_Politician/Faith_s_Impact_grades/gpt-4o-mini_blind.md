Grade: 50

Comment: While the response acknowledges the diversity in expressions of faith, it lacks specificity on how true faith in Jesus specifically manifests in a person's life according to Christian doctrine. A more doctrinally sound answer would include aspects such as repentance, obedience to God's Word, living a life of holiness, and bearing fruit in line with the teachings of Jesus.
