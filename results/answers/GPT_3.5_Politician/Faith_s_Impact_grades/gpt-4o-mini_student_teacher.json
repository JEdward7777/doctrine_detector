However, the answer lacks a specific Christian worldview perspective on the evidence of genuine faith in daily life, such as the presence of good spiritual fruits as a result of the Holy Spirit's influence. A stronger emphasis on the transformational aspect of faith in producing behaviors aligned with Christian teachings would enhance the answer."
