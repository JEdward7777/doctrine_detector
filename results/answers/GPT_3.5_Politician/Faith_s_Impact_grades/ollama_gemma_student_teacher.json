  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer acknowledges the subjective and diverse nature of faith, which aligns with the Christian understanding of personal faith experiences. However, it lacks specific mention of the transformation and spiritual growth that accompanies true faith in Jesus, as outlined in the reference answer. The grade reflects the partial alignment with the Christian worldview but could benefit from further elaboration on the observable fruits of genuine faith."
