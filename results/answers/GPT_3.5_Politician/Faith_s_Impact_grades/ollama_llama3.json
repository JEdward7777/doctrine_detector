  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response mentions that individuals may express their faith in Jesus through various means, such as acts of kindness, compassion, forgiveness, and serving others. This aligns with the concern of recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life. However, the response does not explicitly state that true faith will produce good spiritual fruits or behaviors because of the Holy Spirit's presence.\n\nThe comment I would provide is: \"This response partially addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of diverse expressions of faith and mentioning some common manifestations of faith in Jesus. While it doesn't directly connect the dots to the answer, it does demonstrate an understanding that faith should be lived out practically.\"\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the concept that faith is not just intellectual assent but must be expressed practically, but could benefit from a more direct connection to the answer and the concern."
