  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the response at 70. The response acknowledges the Christian belief that genuine faith in Jesus will produce good spiritual fruits or behaviors because the Holy Spirit dwells within the individual, aligning with a Christian worldview. However, the original response fails to directly address the concern about recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life. Therefore, while the response touches on an important aspect of Christian faith, it does not fully address the given concern."
