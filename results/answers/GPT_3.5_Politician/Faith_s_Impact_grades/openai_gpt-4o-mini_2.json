  "grade_comment": "I would grade the response as 85.\n\nThis response effectively ties the expression of faith in Jesus to producing good spiritual fruits or behaviors, which aligns with Christian belief that genuine faith manifests in actions. The concern of recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life is addressed by emphasizing the connection between true faith and the presence of the Holy Spirit within an individual.\n\nThe only slight deduction is due to the initial response acknowledging the subjective nature of faith expressions, which could potentially lead to relativism or downplay the objective standards of authentic faith in a Christian worldview. However, the overall emphasis on bearing good spiritual fruits as evidence of genuine faith is strong."
