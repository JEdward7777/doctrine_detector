  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of the importance of faithfulness in marriage and the consequences of adultery. However, the answer could be improved by directly referencing specific biblical passages like Matthew 5:28 that explicitly address adultery and its impact on marriage from a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to further deepen their understanding and integration of biblical teachings would enhance the response."
