  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the significance of giving false testimony in a Christian context, referencing both the ninth commandment and the broader theme of honesty in the Bible. They also highlighted the importance of upholding these values in public roles like politics. However, the student could have further emphasized the gravity of bearing false witness as a serious offense that undermines trust and truth within the community, as stressed in the reference answer."
