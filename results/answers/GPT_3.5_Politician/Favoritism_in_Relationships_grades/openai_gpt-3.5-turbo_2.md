The term "favoritism" refers to showing unfair preference or bias towards certain individuals or groups over others. It can have negative implications for relationships by creating feelings of exclusion, resentment, and unfair treatment among those who are not receiving the same level of favoritism. This can lead to strained relationships, decreased trust, and a breakdown in communication.
