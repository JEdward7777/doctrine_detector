  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer correctly identifies the phrase \"finding grace in the eyes of God\" as related to earning favor or approval through actions, beliefs, or faith. However, it misses the crucial doctrinal perspective that grace is not earned but is a gift from God given through faith in Jesus Christ. It is important to emphasize the biblical truth that grace is unmerited and cannot be achieved through human efforts alone. Offered a more thorough explanation grounded in Christian teaching would have resulted in a higher grade."
