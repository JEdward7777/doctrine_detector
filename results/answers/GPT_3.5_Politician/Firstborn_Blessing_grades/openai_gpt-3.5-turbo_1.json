However, the focus on individual values and beliefs could be more aligned with the specific Christian worldview presented in the given answer. It lacks a clear connection to the spiritual responsibilities associated with family roles as highlighted in the concern. More integration of Christian teachings on stewardship and inheritance within family leadership would strengthen the response."
