  "grade_comment": "The student's answer correctly identifies that both \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" relate to the concept of God's plan or purpose before events occur. However, the answer does not clearly clarify the relationship between the two terms as requested. The reference answer provides a clear distinction that \"foreordain\" emphasizes God's authority in the plan, which the student's response lacks.\n\nGrade: 70\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview, but lacks the specific clarification on the relationship between \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" as requested. More focus on the distinct nuances of each term would improve the response."
