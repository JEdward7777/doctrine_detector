However, there is room for improvement in clearly articulating the Christian perspective on the seriousness of sin and its impact on one's relationship with God. The response could have been more explicit in highlighting the need for believers to confront sin, repent, and seek forgiveness in order to fully experience the love, grace, and mercy of God."
