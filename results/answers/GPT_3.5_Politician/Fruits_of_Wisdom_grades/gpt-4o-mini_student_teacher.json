  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer acknowledges the origin of the concept of the fruits of the Holy Spirit and attempts to address inclusivity and respect for all beliefs. However, the student misses the mark by diluting the specificity and significance of the fruits of the Holy Spirit within the Christian faith tradition. The reference answer clearly outlines specific fruits of the Holy Spirit that a wise person should exhibit, whereas the student's response provides a more generalized and diluted interpretation. The importance of reflecting Christ-like character through the fruits of the Holy Spirit is not fully emphasized in the student's answer, resulting in a lower grade."
