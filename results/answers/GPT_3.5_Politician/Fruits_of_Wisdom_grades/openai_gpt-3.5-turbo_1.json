However, it falls short in explicitly recognizing that these virtues are essential for spiritual growth and should reflect a Christ-like character. While it promotes inclusivity and respect for all beliefs, it could have better integrated a Christian worldview by emphasizing the unique significance of these fruits from a biblical perspective."
