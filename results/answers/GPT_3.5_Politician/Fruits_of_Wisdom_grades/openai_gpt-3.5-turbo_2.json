However, the emphasis on inclusivity and respect for all religions and beliefs may dilute the significance of specifically identifying and manifesting these fruits as essential in the Christian faith. The concept of the fruits of the Holy Spirit is distinctive to Christianity and should be upheld as such for a more robust Christian worldview perspective."
