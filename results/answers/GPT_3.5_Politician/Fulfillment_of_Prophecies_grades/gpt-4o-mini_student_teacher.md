Comment: The student provides a generally accurate explanation of what it means for a prophecy to be fulfilled in Biblical teaching, emphasizing the confirmation of the trustworthiness and accuracy of the prophetic word. However, the student's answer lacks the key Christian worldview perspective that it is God who causes the fulfillment of prophecy, highlighting His sovereignty and involvement in the process. Encouragement to further incorporate the role of God's direct intervention in the fulfillment of prophecy would enhance the response.
