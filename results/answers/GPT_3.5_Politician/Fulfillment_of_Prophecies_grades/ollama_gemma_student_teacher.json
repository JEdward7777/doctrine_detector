  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately defines the fulfillment of a prophecy as the fulfillment of the prediction or divine message foretold in the scriptures. It also acknowledges the importance of approaching religious discussions with sensitivity and respect. However, the answer would benefit from a more explicit statement about God's role in the fulfillment of prophecies, as suggested in the reference answer."
