  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful analysis of the figurative uses of the word 'soul' in the Bible, highlighting its importance for understanding human identity. They have effectively conveyed the holistic nature of human identity as portrayed through the concept of the soul. However, their answer could have been strengthened by directly tying their points back to the specific concern provided, which focused on how acknowledging the figurative language surrounding 'soul' can lead to a deeper understanding of human experience from a biblical perspective. By aligning their response more closely with the concern, the student could have demonstrated a clearer integration of their insights with the Christian worldview."
