Comment: While the answer provides a general understanding of how the term "holy place" can be interpreted beyond the tabernacle or temple, it lacks depth from a Christian worldview. It misses the opportunity to emphasize the unique significance of holy places within Christianity, such as churches as sanctuaries for worship and spiritual community. The response could be improved by incorporating more specific examples and references to Christian teachings on sacred spaces.
