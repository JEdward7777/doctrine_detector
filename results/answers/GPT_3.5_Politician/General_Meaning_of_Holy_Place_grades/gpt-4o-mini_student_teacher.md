Comment: The student's answer provides a well-rounded perspective on the concept of "holy place" beyond the tabernacle or temple, incorporating various religious and spiritual contexts. However, from a Christian worldview, the specific understanding of a "holy place" as set apart for God's worship and presence should be emphasized more prominently. It is important to balance the inclusivity of diverse perspectives while also highlighting the unique Christian understanding of holiness.
