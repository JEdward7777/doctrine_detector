Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the broader concept of holy places and the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and practices. However, it could have tied the broader context back more explicitly to the Christian worldview and emphasized the specific Christian perspective on what makes a place holy. It would have been stronger if it had incorporated more direct references to Christian teachings or examples of holy places in Christianity.
