However, the response could have incorporated more explicitly Christian language and theology, such as referencing specific biblical examples of holy places, like the Temple in Jerusalem. Additionally, there was a missed opportunity to connect the concept of \"holy place\" to the importance of seeking and encountering God in such places, as highlighted in the concern about identifying places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter."
