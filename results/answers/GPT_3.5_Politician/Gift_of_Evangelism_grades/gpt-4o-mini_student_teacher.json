  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear explanation of the distinction between an evangelist and other Christians in terms of spiritual gifts related to evangelism. While it is important to respect diversity within the Christian community, the answer does not directly address the specific concern of understanding spiritual gifts related to evangelism and their role in the church. The student should provide a more focused and relevant response in future evaluations."
