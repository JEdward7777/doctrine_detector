Grade: 60

Comment: While the student provided some good ways believers can glorify God in their daily life by showing love, kindness, and engaging in acts of service, the answer fell short of emphasizing the importance of living according to God's character and commandments. Encouraging believers to share testimonies of God's goodness and aligning their lives with His teachings is crucial in actively glorifying God. The response could have been stronger by incorporating more focus on reflecting God's glory through obedience and testimony.
