50.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this answer a 50.

While the student acknowledges the emphasis on the goodness and perfection of God in Jesus' statement, the response lacks specificity and depth in explaining the significance within a Christian worldview. The answer could have delved into the theological implications of Jesus affirming the unique goodness of God as part of his divine nature, emphasizing the understanding of God's moral authority in relation to human standards of goodness. Providing more detailed theological insights would have demonstrated a better understanding of the Christian perspective on this statement.
