  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response generally aligns with the concern and answer, emphasizing God's supreme goodness and perfection as the ultimate standard of goodness. However, it could be more explicit in its connection to recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. While it touches on this idea by mentioning \"recognizing the importance of\" God's goodness, it could be further developed. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' statement and its implications for our understanding of God's nature and authority.\n\nThe grade is 85 because the response mostly addresses the concern and answer, but could benefit from more explicit development and connection to recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs."
