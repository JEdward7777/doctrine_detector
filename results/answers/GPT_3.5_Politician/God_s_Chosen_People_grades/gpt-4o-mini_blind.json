  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student's response acknowledges the concept of a \"remnant\" but fails to delve deeper into the Christian understanding of this term. The answer lacks a clear connection to God's selective grace as revealed in the Bible. Additionally, the emphasis on inclusivity and tolerance overshadows the theological significance of the remnant in Christian doctrine. The response would benefit from a more thorough exploration of biblical references and the theological implications of God's selective grace towards His people."
