  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a general understanding of the concept of a \"remnant\" and acknowledged the idea of God's selective grace. However, the student focused more on the importance of inclusivity and diversity in religious discussions rather than specifically addressing the question of God's selective grace towards His people. The response lacked depth and did not thoroughly explore the Christian perspective on being chosen by God, which was the main concern of the question."
