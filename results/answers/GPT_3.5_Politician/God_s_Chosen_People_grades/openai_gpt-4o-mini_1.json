The reference to God's selective grace and blessings based on faithfulness is relevant, but lacks depth in explaining the theological implications of being chosen by God. Additionally, while the response emphasizes the importance of tolerance and inclusivity, it does not effectively integrate a Christian-specific worldview into the discussion. More emphasis on the biblical teachings about being chosen by God and the responsibility that comes with it would have strengthened the response."
