However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the Christian perspective of God's grace and election, and how this concept aligns with the belief in God's sovereignty and perfect justice. Additionally, it would be beneficial to incorporate more scriptural references or theological insights to support and deepen the understanding of the concept of the \"remnant\" within a Christian worldview."
