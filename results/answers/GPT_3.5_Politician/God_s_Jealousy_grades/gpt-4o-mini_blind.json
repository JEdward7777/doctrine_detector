However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the theological underpinning of God's jealousy, rooted in His perfect love and righteousness. The reference to personal interpretations and beliefs could be misleading, as the concept of God's jealousy is a doctrinal truth that should be understood within the context of Christian theology."
