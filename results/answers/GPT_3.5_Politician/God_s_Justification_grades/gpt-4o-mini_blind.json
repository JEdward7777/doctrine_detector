Justification, in the context of Christianity, is not simply a matter of personal interpretation or belief systems varying widely. It is essential to understand and communicate the Christian belief that justification comes through faith in Jesus Christ alone, as stated in Romans 3:28 - \"For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.\" This answer doesn't reflect this crucial aspect of Christian doctrine."
