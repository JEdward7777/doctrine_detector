  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a limited understanding of the Christian doctrine of justification. While it acknowledges the importance of respecting different beliefs and perspectives, it fails to provide a clear explanation of how God justifies sinners according to Christian theology. The answer lacks specific reference to Jesus Christ or the act of redemption through his sacrifice."
