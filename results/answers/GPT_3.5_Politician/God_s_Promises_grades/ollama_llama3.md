I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of God's promises in demonstrating His faithfulness and commitment to His people, providing assurance of His love and the fulfillment of His plans. The example from Scripture (Noah, Abram, and the covenant with David) is relevant and supports the main point.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance of God's promises and how they relate to trusting His faithfulness in one's own life.
