The inclusion of examples from the Bible, such as Noah, Abram, and David, further strengthens the argument. However, the response could have delved deeper into the transformative power of God's promises in shaping believers' faith and trust in Him. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the Christian belief in the nature of God's promises and their impact on believers' lives would have enhanced the response."
