It misses the opportunity to emphasize the importance of seeking God through prayer, Scripture, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Encouraging a generic approach to spirituality without pointing to the foundational truths of Christianity undermines the doctrinal correctness required in this context. A more sound response would center on aligning one's life with God's Word and seeking His will through prayer and submission to His guidance."
