  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of seeking guidance from God through prayer, the Bible, mature Christians, and circumstances. This aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the concern about believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose is not directly addressed in the response. It would have been stronger if the writer had specifically addressed how to deal with spiritual uncertainty through faith in God's plan and reassurance of His guidance."
