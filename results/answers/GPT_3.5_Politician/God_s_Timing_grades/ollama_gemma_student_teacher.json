  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately addresses the concern by exploring the relationship between God's timing and human expectations. However, it lacks specific references to Christian beliefs or scripture, which could strengthen the response from a Christian perspective. Additionally, the answer focuses primarily on the political relevance of understanding \"appointed time,\" but it could benefit from a broader exploration of its significance in personal and spiritual contexts."
