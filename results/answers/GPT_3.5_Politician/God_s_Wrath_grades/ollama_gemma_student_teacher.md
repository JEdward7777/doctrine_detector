## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** While the student's response demonstrates sensitivity and inclusivity, it avoids addressing the specific concern regarding God's punishment during the 'day of Yahweh.' The response does not provide any information regarding the nature of God's judgment or its consequences for disbelief, which is the focus of the question.
