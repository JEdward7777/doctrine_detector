However, the concern about God's judgment and consequences for disbelief is not directly addressed or integrated into the response. In a Christian worldview, it is important to acknowledge the reality of God's judgment and the consequences of disbelief while still promoting unity and understanding. Encouraging a balanced approach that combines sensitivity and inclusivity with a recognition of God's righteous judgment would enhance the overall response."
