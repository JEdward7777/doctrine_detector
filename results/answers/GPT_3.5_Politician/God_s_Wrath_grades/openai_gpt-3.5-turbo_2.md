Comment: The response promotes unity and understanding, which are valuable aspects in fostering positive relationships among individuals with diverse beliefs. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to also acknowledge the concept of God's judgment and the consequences for disbelief as highlighted in the concern. It would have been beneficial to address how promoting unity can coexist with the understanding of God's judgment in a balanced manner.
