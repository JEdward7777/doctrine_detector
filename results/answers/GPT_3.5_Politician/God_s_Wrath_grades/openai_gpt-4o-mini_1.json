However, when discussing the nature of God's judgment and the consequences for disbelief, it is important to also acknowledge the Christian belief in the concept of God's wrath and judgment. The response could have addressed this concern by integrating the idea of God's punishment and the importance of belief in accordance with Christian teachings."
