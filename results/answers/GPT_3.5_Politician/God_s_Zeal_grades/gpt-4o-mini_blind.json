It misses the opportunity to delve into the biblical understanding of the term \"zeal of the Lord\" and how it reflects God's actions towards His people according to Christian teachings. Encouraging sensitivity and respect for differing beliefs is commendable, but in this context, it results in a lack of clarity and depth in addressing the question. A stronger emphasis on biblical insights and theological perspectives would have improved the response."
