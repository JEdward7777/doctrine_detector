  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response acknowledges the term \"zeal of the Lord\" and attempts to show respect for diverse religious beliefs, which is commendable. However, the answer lacks depth in connecting God's zeal specifically to His actions towards His people. The student could have delved deeper into how God's zeal reflects His commitment to believers' well-being, as outlined in the concern given. While the response is generally respectful, it misses the mark in fully addressing the Christian perspective on God's zeal towards His people."
