  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 75\n\n**Comment:** While the student's answer adequately acknowledges the importance of respecting diverse religious beliefs and demonstrates an understanding of the term \"zeal of the Lord,\" it lacks depth and fails to fully address the specific concern about deepening believers' trust in God's commitment to their well-being. The response primarily focuses on respecting different faith traditions and avoids a direct explanation of how the term reflects God's actions towards His people."
