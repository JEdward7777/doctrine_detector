The acknowledgement of the importance of respecting diverse religious beliefs and the sensitivity in approaching discussions on religious terminology is commendable. However, a Christian worldview perspective could have been more explicitly integrated by emphasizing the specific Christian understanding of God's zeal and its significance in deepening believers' trust in His commitment. This response could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of God's zeal to Christian theology and the importance of trust in God's character."
