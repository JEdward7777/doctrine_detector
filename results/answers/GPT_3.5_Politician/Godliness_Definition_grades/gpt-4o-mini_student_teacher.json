  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of 'godliness' in the context of the Bible, focusing on virtues and principles of righteousness. While the answer captures important aspects of godliness, it falls slightly short in directly addressing the concern of how to incorporate godliness into daily life and actions. The student could strengthen the answer by emphasizing practical examples or specific actions believers can take to manifest godliness in their daily lives."
