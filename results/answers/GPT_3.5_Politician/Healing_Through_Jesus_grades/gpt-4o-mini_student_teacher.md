Grade: 70

Comment: The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals in terms of showing compassion and care. However, it falls short of recognizing the crucial element of Jesus' authority over evil spirits and the specific method of casting out demons through command. Emphasizing the importance of Jesus' authority and the power of prayer and faith in healing would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
