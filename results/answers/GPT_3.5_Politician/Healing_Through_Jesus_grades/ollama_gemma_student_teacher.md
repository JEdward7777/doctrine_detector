**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern by recognizing Jesus' authority over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. However, it lacks specific examples or references from the Bible to support the claim that Jesus healed demon-possessed individuals by commanding the demons to come out. Including such references would strengthen the response.
