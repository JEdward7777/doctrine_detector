It aligns well with the concern regarding the power of prayer and faith in healing. The reference to Jesus showing compassion and care for demon-possessed individuals also reflects a Christian worldview of approaching such situations with sensitivity and respect. Overall, a strong response demonstrating understanding of Christian beliefs on this topic."
