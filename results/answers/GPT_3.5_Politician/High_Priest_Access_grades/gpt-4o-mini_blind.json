In a Christian worldview, the Bible clearly outlines who was allowed to approach the ark of the covenant and under what circumstances. This answer misses the mark by not addressing the specific biblical guidelines regarding the ark. Next time, it is crucial to provide a correct and doctrinally sound response within a Christian framework."
