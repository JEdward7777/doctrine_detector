However, the initial response suggests consulting various religious traditions for interpretations on the ark of the covenant, which could potentially dilute the significance of the specific biblical account. It would have been more consistent with a Christian worldview to emphasize the unique and sacred role of the high priest as ordained by God in the Old Testament."
