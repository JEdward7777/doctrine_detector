Comments: The answer provides a good explanation of the symbolic significance of unleavened bread for the Israelites during their escape from Egypt. However, it lacks in elaborating on the theological aspect of the Passover event and the instruction given by God to eat unleavened bread as a remembrance of their deliverance. The response could have delved deeper into the religious context and biblical reasoning behind this practice.
