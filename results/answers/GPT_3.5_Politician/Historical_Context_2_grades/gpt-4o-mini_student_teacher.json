  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated answer that demonstrates an understanding of the symbolic significance of unleavened bread during the Israelites' escape from Egypt. However, the student did not mention God's specific instruction for the Israelites to flee quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, which is an essential aspect from a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to incorporate this detail will strengthen their answer."
