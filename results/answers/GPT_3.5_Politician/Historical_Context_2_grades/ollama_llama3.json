  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does mention the importance of respecting and understanding the cultural and religious significance of the tradition in the Jewish faith, which addresses the concern of recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices (grade 20). However, it does not explicitly state God's instruction as the reason for eating unleavened bread during the Exodus, instead focusing on the symbolic reminder aspect.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have directly connected the practice to God's instruction and the Israelites' hasty departure from Egypt, acknowledging the divine significance behind this tradition. Nevertheless, the response still demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural context and significance of unleavened bread in Jewish faith, which warrants an 80-grade."
