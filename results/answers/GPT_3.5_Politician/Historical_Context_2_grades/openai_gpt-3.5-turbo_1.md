Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the historical context in which the Israelites ate unleavened bread, attributing it to God's instruction for their swift departure from Egypt. It effectively addresses the concern by acknowledging the significance of the historical events that shape religious practices. However, it could have been further strengthened by explicitly mentioning the importance of obedience to God's command in the context of faith.
