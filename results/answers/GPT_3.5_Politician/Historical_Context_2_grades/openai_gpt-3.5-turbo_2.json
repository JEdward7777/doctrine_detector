It demonstrates an understanding of the significance of this tradition in the Jewish faith. However, the response could have elaborated more on how the Israelites' hurried departure and need to be prepared for the journey ahead were part of their deliverance from slavery, connecting the historical context to the religious practice more explicitly."
