In the Bible, the concept of "remnant" can be seen in various ways, emphasizing the idea of a small group or minority that remains faithful to God in the midst of adversity. Some biblical events that illustrate this concept include:

1. The story of Noah and the ark: In this story from the book of Genesis, Noah and his family are considered the remnant who are saved from the great flood that destroys the rest of humanity due to their righteousness and obedience to God.

2. The remnant of Israel in exile: In the books of Isaiah and Amos, the prophets speak of a remnant of the people of Israel who will be preserved and restored by God despite the nation's sins and exile. This remnant is seen as a sign of God's faithfulness and mercy towards his people.

3. The faithful few in the New Testament: In the New Testament, Jesus often speaks of a "remnant" or a "faithful few" who will inherit the kingdom of God. This includes his disciples and followers who remain steadfast in their beliefs despite persecution and betrayal.

Overall, the concept of remnant in the Bible serves to highlight the importance of faithfulness and perseverance in the face of challenges, and the belief that God will ultimately preserve and redeem those who remain true to him.
