  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-developed and thoughtful answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of \"remnant\" in the Bible. They have effectively highlighted various biblical events that illustrate this concept, showing the importance of faithfulness and perseverance in God's promises. However, the student could have provided more specific examples from Isaiah and Amos to directly address the concern regarding the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises. Overall, the student's response aligns well with a Christian worldview."
