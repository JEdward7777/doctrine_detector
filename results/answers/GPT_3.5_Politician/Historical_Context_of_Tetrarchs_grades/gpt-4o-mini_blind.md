The division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies had various effects on the Jewish people. It led to political fragmentation and instability among the Jewish communities, as different tetrarchs had varying levels of control and influence over the region. This fragmentation also created opportunities for outside powers to intervene in the affairs of the Jewish people.

Moreover, the tetrarchies resulted in disputes over land ownership, taxation, and religious practices, leading to social and economic tensions within Jewish society. The diverse cultural and religious influences within each tetrarchy also contributed to the diversity of Jewish beliefs and practices during this period.

Overall, the division of Herod's kingdom into tetrarchies created a complex political landscape for the Jewish people, impacting their daily lives and interactions with both local and foreign authorities.
