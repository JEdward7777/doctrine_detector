The focus on empathy and respect, while important, detracts from addressing the actual impact of Roman crucifixion on the perception of the cross in early Christianity. The answer would benefit from incorporating more theological insights and historical context to provide a stronger foundation for understanding the significance of the cross in Christian belief."
