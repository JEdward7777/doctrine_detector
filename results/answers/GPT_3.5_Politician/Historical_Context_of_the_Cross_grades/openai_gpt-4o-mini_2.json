  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 95.\n\nThe response accurately addresses the concern by highlighting the transformation of the symbol of the cross from one of shame and suffering to one of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection, which is indeed central to the Christian message. The language used effectively communicates this transformation within the Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be providing a direct connection between this transformation and how it reflects the Christian belief in redemption and salvation through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross."
