The examples given are accurate, and the explanation of the significance behind each individual's altar-building is clear. However, to enhance the answer, deeper theological insights could have been included, such as the concept of sacrifice and worship in the construction of altars, tying it back to Christ as the ultimate sacrifice. Nonetheless, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
