It provides detailed examples of individuals who built altars and their motivations. The student also correctly notes that the act of building an altar symbolized commitment to God and communication with Him. However, the response could benefit from including additional examples from the Bible, particularly mentioning Noah's altar after the flood as suggested in the reference answer."
