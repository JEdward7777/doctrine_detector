When introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit in contexts unfamiliar with the Trinity, it is important to approach the topic with sensitivity and respect for differing beliefs. One way to introduce the Holy Spirit is to explain it as a divine presence or guiding force that is believed to be active in the world and in people's lives.
