This approach aligns well with the concern to prevent misconceptions about the Holy Spirit's identity and work. However, it could be beneficial to also address the importance of sensitivity and respect for differing beliefs when discussing the Holy Spirit with those unfamiliar with the concept, as well as encouraging open dialogue and understanding of diverse perspectives."
