However, the initial response falls short in fully aligning with a Christian worldview by not explicitly stating the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity and emphasizing His central role in the believer's life through sound teaching. The suggested approach of introducing the Holy Spirit as a divine presence, while sensitive to diverse beliefs, could potentially lead to a dilution of the foundational Christian belief in the Triune God. A more direct and explicit teaching on the identity and role of the Holy Spirit within the Trinity would have been more in line with a Christian-specific worldview."
