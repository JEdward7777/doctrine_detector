  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a general overview of the significance of hope in the Bible but did not specifically address the implications of hopelessness in a Christian worldview. The answer lacks depth and fails to tie in the specific concerns raised in the question. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the theological implications and consequences of hopelessness in light of Christian beliefs would improve the response."
