Comment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of how the term "hosts" is used in scripture, mentioning its references to angels, heavenly beings, creation, and believers. However, the explanation could be improved by emphasizing the biblical context and the spiritual warfare aspect often associated with the term "hosts."

Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological exploration.
