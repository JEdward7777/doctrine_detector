I would grade the student's response a 80. 

The student has a good understanding of the term "hosts" in Scripture and correctly identifies some of its representations such as the heavenly beings, stars, and believers. They also acknowledge the idea of a powerful and organized group serving a higher purpose, which aligns well with the Christian worldview. However, the student could improve by providing more specific examples or references from Scripture to further support their points. Strengthening the biblical basis of their answer would enhance the depth and accuracy of their response in light of the concern mentioned.
