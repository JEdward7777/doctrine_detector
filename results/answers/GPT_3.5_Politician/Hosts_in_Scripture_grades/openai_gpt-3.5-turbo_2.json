It acknowledges the different interpretations based on context. However, the response could further emphasize the significance of spiritual warfare and divine authority in shaping a believer's prayer life and approach to spiritual battles. Encouraging a deeper reflection on the implications of these concepts would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
