However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to also address the spiritual aspect of jealousy and how it can stem from a lack of contentment, comparison, or covetousness. Encouraging individuals to turn to God for help in overcoming jealousy and seeking His guidance in building healthy relationships would enhance the overall response."
