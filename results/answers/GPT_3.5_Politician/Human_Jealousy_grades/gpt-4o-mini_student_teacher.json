They correctly emphasized open communication, trust, and understanding as key factors in handling jealousy constructively. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly stating that jealousy should not be allowed to foster resentment or suspicion, as it can be detrimental to relationships. Overall, a well-rounded response with room for slight improvement."
