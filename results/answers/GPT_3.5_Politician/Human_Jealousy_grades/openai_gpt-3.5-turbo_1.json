  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of recognizing and addressing jealousy in relationships, emphasizing open communication and trust. It aligns well with the Christian value of promoting healthy relationships based on mutual respect and understanding. The suggestion to view jealousy as a warning sign and to strive for constructive communication is in line with Christian teachings on forgiveness, empathy, and reconciliation. A slightly higher grade could be achieved by explicitly mentioning the need for prayer and seeking God's guidance in navigating feelings of jealousy within relationships."
