However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the foundational belief in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus on the cross as the means by which believers are declared righteous before God. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clearly state the centrality of grace in the process of justification and the role of faith as the mechanism by which righteousness is imputed to believers. A more robust explanation rooted in key Christian doctrines would enhance the response."
