Comment: The student provides a generally accurate explanation of how a person can be declared righteous in the Christian faith through faith in Jesus Christ. They mention acknowledging sins, seeking forgiveness, and living according to Jesus' teachings, which are important aspects. However, the student could have emphasized more explicitly the foundational belief that righteousness is attained through trust in Jesus to save and the imputation of Jesus' righteousness to believers, as stated in the reference answer. This key aspect is crucial for understanding the basis of human righteousness in Christianity in relation to faith in Jesus.
