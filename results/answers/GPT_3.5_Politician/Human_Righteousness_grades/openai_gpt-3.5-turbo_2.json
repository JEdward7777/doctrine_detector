  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively ties the concept of righteousness to faith in Jesus, highlighting the essential role of trusting in Jesus for salvation and the imputation of His righteousness. It aligns well with the concern provided, clarifying the basis for human righteousness within a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the cleansing of sins through Jesus' sacrifice as a key aspect of being declared righteous."
