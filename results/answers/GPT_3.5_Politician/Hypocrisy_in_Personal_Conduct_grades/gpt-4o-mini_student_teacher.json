  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response on ensuring actions align with beliefs by emphasizing self-reflection, seeking feedback, and approaching situations with empathy. While their answer lacked specific reference to seeking God's guidance through prayer and living according to His Word, they demonstrated a strong understanding of the importance of self-awareness and accountability in avoiding hypocrisy. A higher grade would be given if they had included a clearer connection to seeking God's guidance in their response."
