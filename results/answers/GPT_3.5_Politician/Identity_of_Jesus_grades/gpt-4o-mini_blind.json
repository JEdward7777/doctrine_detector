However, it lacks depth in explaining His purpose more thoroughly, such as His sacrificial death on the cross for the redemption of humanity's sins. Additionally, the mention of Jesus as a symbol of hope and faith is correct, but it could be strengthened by emphasizing His unique role as the Son of God and the Savior of the world. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the biblical teachings and theological significance of Jesus' purpose would enhance the response."
