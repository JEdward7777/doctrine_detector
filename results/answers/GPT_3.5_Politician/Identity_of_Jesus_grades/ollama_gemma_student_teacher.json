  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately explains the significance of Jesus's name in Christianity as a symbol of hope and faith. However, it lacks a deeper understanding of the meaning of the name \"Jesus\" as derived from its biblical origins. The inclusion of the reference answer would have strengthened the student's response by providing more explicit information about Jesus's purpose as a Savior."
