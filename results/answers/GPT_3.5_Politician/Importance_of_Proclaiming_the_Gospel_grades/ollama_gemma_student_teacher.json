  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of proclaiming the \"good news\" for Christians. They correctly point out that it is a deeply held part of their faith tradition and a way for them to connect with others. However, the answer would be improved if the student had directly referenced the biblical passages or teachings that support the importance of sharing the Gospel message."
