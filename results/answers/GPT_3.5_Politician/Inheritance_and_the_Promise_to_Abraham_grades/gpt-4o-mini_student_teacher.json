  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student correctly identified that God promised Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan as an inheritance, they did not accurately capture the permanence of this promise. The reference answer specifies that the land would belong to them forever, emphasizing the eternal nature of God's covenant with Abraham. The student's response falls short in fully conveying the depth and significance of God's promise in a Christian worldview."
