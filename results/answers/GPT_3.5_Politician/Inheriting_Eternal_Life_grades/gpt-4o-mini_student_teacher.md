Grade: 5

Comment: The student's response completely avoids addressing the question about the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus that was specified in the concern. Instead, the student's answer focuses on promoting understanding and inclusivity, which is important, but not directly relevant to the question asked. The student should have provided an answer based on the teachings of Jesus, specifically addressing the interaction with the expert in Jewish law as noted in the reference answer.
