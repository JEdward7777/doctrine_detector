**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and promoting inclusivity. However, it lacks specificity in addressing the concern related to clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. While acknowledging the sensitivity of religious discussions is commendable, a more detailed explanation of Jesus' teachings would have been beneficial.
