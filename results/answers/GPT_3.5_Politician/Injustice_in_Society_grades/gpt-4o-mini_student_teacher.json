  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer acknowledges various forms of injustice in the world today and mentions the importance of addressing these issues. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on Christian activism against injustice and promoting fairness based on biblical principles, as highlighted in the concern. While the student mentions drawing inspiration from the teachings of the Bible, there is a need for a stronger integration of Christian principles and a call to action for Christians to actively engage in advocating, demonstrating mercy, and acting righteously in combating injustice. More explicit references to biblical teachings and a stronger emphasis on the Christian responsibility to actively fight against injustice would have strengthened the response."
