It appropriately emphasizes the importance of solidarity, love, compassion, and justice in addressing various forms of injustice. The focus on actively listening to marginalized voices, supporting equality-promoting policies, and engaging in peaceful activism aligns well with promoting fairness based on Christian teachings. However, there could have been a more explicit mention of the need for Christians to take proactive steps in actively confronting and challenging systemic injustices in society."
