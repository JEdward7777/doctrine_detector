However, the response lacks specific references to biblical passages that address this concept directly. It also does not delve deeply into the theological significance of innocent blood within Christian doctrine. While the answer touches on the importance of valuing all human life and promoting justice and compassion, it could be more robust and anchored in a more detailed exploration of biblical teachings on the sanctity of life."
