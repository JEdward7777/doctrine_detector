  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the connection between responses to God and their alignment with God's will. It acknowledges the subjective nature of faith and respects diverse perspectives, while highlighting the influence of faith on personal values and actions. The response also acknowledges the broader impact of belief on mental and emotional well-being. However, it could benefit from a more explicit connection to the specific concern raised in the prompt, which focuses on the influence of choices on the unfolding of God's plans."
