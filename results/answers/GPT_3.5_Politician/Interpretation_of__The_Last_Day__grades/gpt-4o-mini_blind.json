However, it lacks depth and does not delve into the biblical basis or theological significance of this belief. Additionally, the statement about respecting diverse beliefs in denominations could potentially lead to ambiguity regarding the core doctrine of the final judgment in Christian faith. A stronger emphasis on biblical support and doctrinal clarity would enhance the response."
