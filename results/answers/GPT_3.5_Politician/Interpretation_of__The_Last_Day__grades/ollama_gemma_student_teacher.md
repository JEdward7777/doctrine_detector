**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately defines the "last day" in Christian teaching as the final judgment. However, it could benefit from more elaboration on the concept of eschatology and the diversity of interpretations among Christian denominations. Additionally, the response lacks specific mention of judgment related to turning away from God, which aligns with the teacher's reference answer.
