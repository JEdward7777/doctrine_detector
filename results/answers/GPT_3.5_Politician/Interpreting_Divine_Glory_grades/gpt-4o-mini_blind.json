However, the response lacks depth in exploring the significance of 'divine glory' within Christian worship specifically. It would greatly benefit from incorporating biblical references or theological teachings to support and enhance the explanation within a Christian worldview. Additionally, the statement about being respectful and inclusive of diverse beliefs, while important in general discourse, may not align completely with a Christian perspective that upholds the uniqueness and exclusivity of Christ. Improvements can be made to provide a more robust and doctrinally sound discussion."
