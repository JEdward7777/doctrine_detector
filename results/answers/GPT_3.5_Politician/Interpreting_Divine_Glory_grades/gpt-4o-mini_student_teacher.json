  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70. \n\nWhile the student addresses the concept of 'divine glory' in the context of worship, their explanation lacks a clear emphasis on the magnificent and radiant nature of God as the reference answer highlights. The student's response focuses more on general expressions of reverence and awe towards a spiritual or divine being, without specifically anchoring it to the inherently majestic nature of God. \n\nFurthermore, the student's mention of the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and practices, while valid in a broader context, slightly detracts from the depth of understanding 'divine glory' within a Christian-specific worldview, as the concern provided emphasizes the centrality of recognizing God's glory in worship practices. \n\nTherefore, the student's answer, while touching on key elements, could benefit from a stronger emphasis on God's majestic nature as the essence of 'divine glory' in the Christian understanding of worship."
