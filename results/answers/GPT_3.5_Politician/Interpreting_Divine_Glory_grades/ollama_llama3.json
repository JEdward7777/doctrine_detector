  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response generally aligns with the specified answer and concern, demonstrating a good understanding of the concept of \"divine glory\" in worship. The mention of reverence and awe towards God's presence is also relevant to recognizing His glory. However, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the concept of \"divine glory\" to biblical teachings and examples, such as the accounts of Jesus' transfiguration or Isaiah's vision of God's throne. Additionally, while the response acknowledges diverse beliefs and practices, it could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of how recognizing God's glory can lead to greater reverence and awe in worship."
