Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of recognizing God's glory in worship practices, aligning with the concern provided. However, the discussion lacks depth in elaborating on how Christians specifically should express reverence and awe towards God in light of His divine glory. More emphasis on the Christian perspective and how it differs from other interpretations would have strengthened the response.
