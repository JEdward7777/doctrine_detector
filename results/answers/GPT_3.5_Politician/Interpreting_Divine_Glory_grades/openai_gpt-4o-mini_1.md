Comment: The response provides a general understanding of 'divine glory' in the context of worship and acknowledges the importance of recognizing and honoring God's glory. It accurately touches on the idea of expressing reverence and awe towards God. However, the response lacks a specific focus on the Christian perspective and could have delved deeper into how recognizing God's glory specifically influences Christian worship practices. More explicit references to Scripture or Christian teachings would have strengthened the response.
