However, they missed a crucial aspect of Jesus' refusal, which was to fully accept his sacrificial role and suffering. Encouraging the student to dig deeper into the biblical context and the significance of Jesus' actions during his crucifixion would help strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
