From a Christian worldview, it is important to recognize and affirm the doctrinal truth that Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" is a claim to His divinity and authority over life and death. The response fails to adequately express the uniqueness and exclusivity of Jesus as the only way to eternal life, which is a fundamental belief in orthodox Christian theology."
