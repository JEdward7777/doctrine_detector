  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer acknowledges the significance of Jesus' statement in Christianity, but falls short of clearly articulating Jesus' identity and role as the source of resurrection and life. The response lacks a clear connection to the Christian worldview perspective provided in the reference answer, as it focuses more on the general importance of religious beliefs and inclusivity rather than providing a specific interpretation within a Christian context. The student would benefit from further exploring and understanding the foundational beliefs of Christianity related to Jesus' identity and role in resurrection."
