  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nWhile the student's answer demonstrates sensitivity and inclusivity, it does not sufficiently address the specific concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. The response provides a general overview of the significance of the statement without offering a clear explanation of its theological meaning related to resurrection. The answer would benefit from a more explicit elaboration on Jesus' role as the source of resurrection and the resurrection experience of believers."
