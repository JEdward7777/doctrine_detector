Different Christian denominations may interpret this statement in various ways, but it generally signifies Jesus' role as a spiritual guide and source of hope for believers. It is essential to approach discussions about religious beliefs with sensitivity and inclusivity.

70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 
While the student's answer demonstrates sensitivity and inclusivity, it does not sufficiently address the specific concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. The response provides a general overview of the significance of the statement without offering a clear explanation of its theological meaning related to resurrection. The answer would benefit from a more explicit elaboration on Jesus' role as the source of resurrection and the resurrection experience of believers.
