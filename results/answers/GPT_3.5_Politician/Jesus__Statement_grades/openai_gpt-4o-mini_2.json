  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively clarifies Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, aligning with the concern provided. It emphasizes the Christian belief in Jesus as the source of resurrection and emphasizes the importance of understanding this for faith and theological understanding. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the core Christian teaching related to Jesus' statement, \"I am the Resurrection and the Life.\" The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a bit more depth or explanation to further enhance the theological perspective."
