Comment: The response does not directly address the question of how Jesus used the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings from a Christian worldview. It lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to provide specific information related to the topic. The emphasis on sensitivity and inclusivity is commendable but should not overshadow the primary focus of the question. A higher grade could be achieved by delving into the biblical context and significance of 'amen' in Jesus' teachings.
