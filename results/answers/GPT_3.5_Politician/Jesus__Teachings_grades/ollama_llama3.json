However, it fails to directly address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. While it mentions Jesus using \"amen\" to emphasize the truth of his statements, it doesn't specifically highlight the authority behind these words. The response also lacks a clear connection between Jesus' use of \"amen\" and its significance in his teachings. To strengthen this response, it would be helpful to explicitly acknowledge the authority of Scripture and how Jesus' words and teachings are rooted in God's word."
