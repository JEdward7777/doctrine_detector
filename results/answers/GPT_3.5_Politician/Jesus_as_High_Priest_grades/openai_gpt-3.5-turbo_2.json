It emphasizes his role as the ultimate sacrifice for sin and the elimination of the need for continuous sacrifices by human priests. The response could have further elaborated on how Jesus fulfills the Old Testament priesthood and brings a new covenant, but overall, it provides a solid understanding of the importance of Jesus' priesthood in Christian belief."
