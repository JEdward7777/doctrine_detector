However, it would have been beneficial for the student to expand on the connections made in the Old Testament pertaining to the high priesthood and how Jesus fulfills those roles as the ultimate High Priest. Additionally, mentioning the Levitical priesthood and its contrast with Jesus' priesthood would have enhanced the depth of the response. Overall, a well-written explanation with room for further theological development."
