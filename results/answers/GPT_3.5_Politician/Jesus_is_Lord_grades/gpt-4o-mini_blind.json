  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response shows some consideration for religious sensitivity and awareness of diverse beliefs. However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness in clearly emphasizing the exclusive claims of Christianity regarding Jesus as Lord. It is important to communicate the distinctiveness and absolute authority of Jesus as Lord without compromising or diluting this foundational Christian belief. The response could be improved by articulating the unique theological significance of Jesus' lordship with confidence and clarity."
