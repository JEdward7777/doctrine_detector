  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a clear explanation of the meaning behind the phrase \"Jesus is Lord,\" emphasizing His divine authority and supremacy over all creation. However, the concern raised regarding the differentiation between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles was not fully addressed. The response could have elaborated further on how to clearly distinguish between the two aspects in order to avoid any conflation or confusion."
