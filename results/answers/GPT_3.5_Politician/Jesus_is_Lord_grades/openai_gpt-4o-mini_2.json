  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the significance of \"Jesus is Lord\" as denoting His divine authority over all creation, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. The concern about differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles is addressed effectively. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique and exclusive nature of Jesus' lordship in a more explicit, doctrinal manner to fully address the concern from a Christian perspective."
