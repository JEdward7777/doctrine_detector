In Islam, Jesus is not considered the Son of God but rather a prophet of Allah. A more accurate translation in a Muslim context would be to highlight Jesus as a revered prophet rather than equating him with being the literal Son of God. It is important to maintain doctrinal correctness when discussing theological concepts across different religions."
