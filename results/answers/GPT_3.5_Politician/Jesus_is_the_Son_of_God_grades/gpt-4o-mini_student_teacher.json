However, they did not accurately translate the phrase \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context. The suggested approach to recognize Jesus as a prophet and a messenger of Allah does not maintain the original terminology and fails to provide a clear teaching and context to explain its meaning as per the Christian specific worldview. The response could have been improved by incorporating the original terminology and offering a more accurate explanation within the Islamic framework."
