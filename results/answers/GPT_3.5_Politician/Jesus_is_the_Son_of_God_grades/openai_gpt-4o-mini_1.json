However, there is a concern that the explanation provided may not fully align with a Christian worldview as it implies equating Jesus as a prophet and messenger of Allah. It is important to ensure that the translation accurately reflects Christian beliefs about Jesus as the literal Son of God and the second person of the Trinity, without adding elements from other faith traditions."
