  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response attempts to translate the concept of \"Jesus is the Son of God\" in a sensitive manner within an Islamic context, it falls short in accurately representing the Biblical truth. It is crucial to maintain the original terminology and provide a clear explanation of its significance, which this response lacks. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to present the Christian belief in a way that reflects its importance and uniqueness. A more thorough explanation rooted in Biblical accuracy would result in a higher grade."
