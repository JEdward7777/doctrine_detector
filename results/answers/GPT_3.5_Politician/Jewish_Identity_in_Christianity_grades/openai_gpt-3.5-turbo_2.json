It addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding the Jewish roots of Christianity for a comprehensive view of the faith. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning how Jesus' Jewish identity connects Christianity to its Jewish roots and heritage, which could further enhance the response."
