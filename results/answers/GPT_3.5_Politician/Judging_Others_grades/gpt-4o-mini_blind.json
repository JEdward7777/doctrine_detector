  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student accurately references Matthew 7:1-5 and highlights the importance of focusing on one's own actions and behavior rather than passing judgment on others, which aligns with Christian teachings. However, the response could be strengthened by including additional scriptural references, such as John 8:7 and Romans 14:10, which further emphasize the importance of refraining from judgment and showing love and forgiveness. Expanding the answer with more biblical support would enhance its doctrinal correctness."
