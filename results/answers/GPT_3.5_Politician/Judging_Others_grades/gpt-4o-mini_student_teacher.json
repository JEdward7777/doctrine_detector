  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good understanding of the general principle of not judging others from Matthew 7:1-5, but they could have included a more direct reference to the specific instruction on how Christians should judge each other as found in Luke 6:37. Additionally, the student did well in mentioning the importance of showing love, kindness, and forgiveness towards others, aligning with the Christian worldview."
