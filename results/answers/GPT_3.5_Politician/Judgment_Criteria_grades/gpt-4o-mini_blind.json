  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response does not address the question about how individuals will be judged on the day of judgment according to the biblical perspective. It misses the opportunity to provide a Christian worldview on the topic. The focus on respecting diverse perspectives, while important in certain contexts, is not suitable for a question specifically asking for a biblical perspective. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and does not engage with the core of the question."
