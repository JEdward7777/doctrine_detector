  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response completely misses the specific concern of the question, which is to explore how individuals will be judged on the day of judgment according to the biblical perspective. The answer does not address this concern at all and instead focuses on promoting tolerance of diverse beliefs without providing any insight into the Christian perspective on judgment."
