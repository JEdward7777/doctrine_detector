  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 30/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a lack of understanding of the biblical perspective on judgment and fails to address the specific concern of the question. The response lacks clarity, fails to engage with the biblical concept of judgment, and offers a generic statement about respecting different perspectives without providing any insight into how individuals will be judged according to Christian principles."
