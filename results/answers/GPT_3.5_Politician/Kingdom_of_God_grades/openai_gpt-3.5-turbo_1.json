  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies the concern that rephrasing 'Kingdom of God' could potentially dilute its deep spiritual and biblical significance. It advocates for retaining the term while providing explanations to help others understand its meaning. The concern is adequately addressed, but it could be strengthened with a more explicit reference to the importance of preserving the term's biblical context in conveying the message effectively."
