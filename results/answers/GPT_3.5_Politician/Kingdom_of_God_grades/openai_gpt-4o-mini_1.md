Comment: The response provided a strong Christian-specific perspective by advocating for retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' and emphasizing the importance of explaining its spiritual and eschatological significance. This aligns well with a Christian worldview that values the depth and biblical context of key theological terms. The concern about potentially losing the depth and biblical context through rephrasing was effectively addressed in the response. The only area for improvement would be to further elaborate on the significance and implications of 'Kingdom of God' in different cultural contexts.
