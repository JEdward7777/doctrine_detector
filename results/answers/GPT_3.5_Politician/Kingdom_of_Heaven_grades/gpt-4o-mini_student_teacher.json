However, the answer does not directly address the concern by providing a Christian-specific explanation for the importance of retaining the term 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' in the book of Matthew, as outlined in the reference answer. Integrating a Christian worldview perspective would have strengthened the clarity and depth of the response."
