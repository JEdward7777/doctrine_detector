  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" within the Book of Matthew, emphasizing its theological implications and connection to the gospel of Matthew. It aligns well with the concern regarding understanding the unique terminology in the gospels to grasp the intended messages of the biblical authors. The response appropriately acknowledges and respects the importance of religious language and terminology in a politically correct manner, while also highlighting the significance of maintaining the integrity of Christian doctrine."
