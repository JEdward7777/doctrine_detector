  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a mostly accurate response, correctly identifying Hebrew as the language in which the vast majority of the Old Testament was written. They also mentioned the additional inclusion of Aramaic, which is a minor inaccuracy as Aramaic is only present in certain sections of Daniel and Ezra. Overall, their answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the languages used in the Old Testament."
