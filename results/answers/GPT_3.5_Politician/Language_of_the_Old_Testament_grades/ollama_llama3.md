Comment: The response accurately states that most of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is the correct information. However, it does not specify that there is a small portion written in Aramaic, which is an important detail for understanding the original context of the Scriptures. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the linguistic background of the Old Testament and scores well on the specified concern, as it acknowledges the importance of knowing the language in which the Scriptures were written.

To reach a perfect score, the response would need to include the additional detail about the Aramaic portion, for example: "The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with a small portion also written in Aramaic."
