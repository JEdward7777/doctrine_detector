Comment: The answer provides a basic understanding of how believers in a particular city typically met, but it lacks specific details or references to biblical teachings on gathering as a church community. Expanding on how believers gathered to worship, study scripture, and fellowship would improve the grade. Additionally, connecting the practice to biblical principles or early church practices would strengthen the response.
