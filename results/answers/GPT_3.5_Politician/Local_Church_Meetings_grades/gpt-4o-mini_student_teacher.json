  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response correctly states that believers typically gathered together in a designated meeting place within the city, which aligns with the idea of believers meeting in a specific location for fellowship. However, the student did not specifically mention meeting in homes for prayer and scripture discussion, which is an important aspect of fostering local fellowship among believers. It would have been beneficial for the student to include this key detail to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the encouragement for believers to gather in fellowship."
