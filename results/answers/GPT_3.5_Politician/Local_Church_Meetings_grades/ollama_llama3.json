  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response does mention that members gathered together, it doesn't specifically emphasize the importance of local fellowship among believers, which is the main concern. Additionally, the response focuses more on the physical location (a designated meeting place) rather than the purpose and nature of their gathering (praying and discussing scripture). The original answer highlights the importance of fostering local fellowship by meeting in someone's home, which aligns better with the concern.\n\nComment: This response could be improved by explicitly emphasizing the value of local fellowship and incorporating more details about the nature of their gatherings."
