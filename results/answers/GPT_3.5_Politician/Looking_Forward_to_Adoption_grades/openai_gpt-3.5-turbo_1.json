While it is commendable to respect religious diversity, a Christian worldview would expect a deeper engagement with the specific interpretation of Romans 8:23 in light of biblical teachings. Encouraging dialogue is positive, but a more robust discussion rooted in the Christian understanding of adoption into God's family would have been more appropriate."
