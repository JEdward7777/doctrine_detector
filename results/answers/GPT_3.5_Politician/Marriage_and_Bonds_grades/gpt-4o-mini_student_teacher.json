  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a strong understanding of the significance of the bond of marriage in the Christian faith, emphasizing love, respect, and mutual support. They also highlight the importance of trust, communication, and prioritizing the relationship. The response aligns well with promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages and honoring God's design for relationships. However, there could have been more emphasis on the divine aspect and the lifelong, unbreakable nature of the marriage covenant. Overall, a solid response with room for slight improvement."
