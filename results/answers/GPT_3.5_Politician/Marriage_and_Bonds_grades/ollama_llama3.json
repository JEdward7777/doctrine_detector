  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response largely aligns with the correct answer, emphasizing the sacred nature of marriage and the importance of mutual support and love between spouses. It also includes some biblical principles, such as honoring and cherishing one's partner, prioritizing their relationship, and approaching challenges with forgiveness and humility. The mention of God being at the center of the relationship is a great way to emphasize the Christian worldview.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas for improvement. For instance, while the response touches on the importance of trust, communication, and understanding in a marriage, it could have delved deeper into these aspects. Additionally, the response could have more explicitly connected the Christian view of marriage to God's design or plan for relationships. Nevertheless, overall, this is a strong response that effectively promotes Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical view of marriage and offers some practical advice for building a strong, Christian marriage. With a bit more depth and explicit connection to Scripture, it could be even stronger!"
