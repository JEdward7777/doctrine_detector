It also acknowledges the variations in spelling that may exist in different translations, showing an awareness of textual differences. However, it could have been enhanced by further emphasizing that the exact names and order of the disciples are consistent in the four books mentioned, despite potential spelling variations. Additionally, a more explicit reference to the specific chapters or verses in these books where the names can be found would have added depth to the answer."
