Comment: The student correctly identified the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke where the names of the twelve disciples are listed, but included Acts which does not list all the disciples' names. They also appropriately mentioned the variations in spellings across translations. Overall, a solid understanding of the question with just a minor mistake on the additional book mentioned.
