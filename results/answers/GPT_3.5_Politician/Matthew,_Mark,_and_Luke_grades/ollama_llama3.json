  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides some accurate information, such as mentioning that the disciples' names are listed in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. However, it lacks specificity and fails to mention Acts, which also contains the list of disciples. Furthermore, it does not highlight the importance of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, which is a crucial concern for Christians.\n\nTo improve the response, the writer could have provided more detail about the Gospel accounts and emphasized their significance in understanding the teachings and stories of the Bible. As it stands, the response receives a grade of 80, indicating a decent effort but room for improvement."
