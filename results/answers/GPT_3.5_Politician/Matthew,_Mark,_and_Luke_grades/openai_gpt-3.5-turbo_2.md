Grade: 75

Comment: The response accurately identifies where the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the Bible, but it falls short in fully addressing the concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. It would have been stronger if the response had elaborated on the significance of the twelve disciples in the context of the Gospel narratives and their roles in spreading the teachings of Jesus.
