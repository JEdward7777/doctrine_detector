However, there were inaccuracies in the references provided (Jeremiah 23:5 instead of 2 Samuel 7:12-13) and the student's interpretation may have slightly veered away from the Christian specific understanding of the prophecies. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the specific Old Testament references and their fulfillment by Jesus would strengthen their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
