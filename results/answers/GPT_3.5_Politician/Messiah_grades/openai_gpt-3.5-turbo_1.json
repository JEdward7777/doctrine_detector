However, the response could be improved by more clearly emphasizing the unique role of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the true savior, thus differentiating Him from other religious savior figures. This clarification would further align the discussion with a Christian-specific worldview and scriptural truth."
