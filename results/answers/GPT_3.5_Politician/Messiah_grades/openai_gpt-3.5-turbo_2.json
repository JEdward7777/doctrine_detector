However, it falls short in clearly emphasizing Jesus' unique role as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His significance as the Savior. The response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on Jesus' divinity and His sacrificial atonement for humanity's sins, as taught in Christian doctrine. This would help differentiate Jesus from other religious savior figures and align more closely with the concern of staying true to Scripture."
