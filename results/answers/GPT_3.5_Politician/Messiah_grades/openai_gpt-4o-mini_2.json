However, the response could be improved by clearly teaching the specific Christian perspective on the Messiah as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His unique role as the savior. Adding more emphasis on Jesus as the unique Savior in Christianity while staying true to scripture would enhance the clarity and differentiation from other religious savior figures."
