  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the sensitivity surrounding religious discussions and the importance of respect for diverse beliefs. However, it lacks specific theological insights or interpretations of the title \"King of the Jews\" in relation to Jesus' identity as the Messiah. To improve the grade, the student should have elaborated on the significance of the title within Christian theology and its fulfillment in Jesus' ministry and sacrifice."
