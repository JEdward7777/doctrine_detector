  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 75.\n\nThe answer provides a basic understanding of what it means to 'minister' to others according to the Bible. It correctly highlights serving, helping, showing compassion, and sharing faith teachings. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the response could further emphasize the importance of ministering in line with biblical teachings and the centrality of Christ in the act of ministry. There is room for improvement in articulating the theological significance of ministry in a Christian worldview."
