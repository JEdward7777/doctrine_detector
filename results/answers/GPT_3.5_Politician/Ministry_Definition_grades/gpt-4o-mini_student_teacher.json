  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student's response captures the essence of serving others with care and compassion, the biblical perspective emphasizes not only caring for physical needs but also teaching about God. The student correctly mentions sharing teachings and principles of faith, however, the emphasis on teaching about God and caring for spiritual needs is more central to the biblical concept of ministry. Encouraging further integration of these spiritual aspects would improve the student's understanding of ministry from a Christian worldview."
