Comment: The student provided a generally good understanding of fulfilling one's ministry as a Christian by emphasizing living out Christian values and serving others. However, the answer lacks a direct reference to fulfilling the calling God has placed on one's life, which is pivotal in understanding and executing one's God-given purpose in serving others from a Christian worldview. The student should further strengthen their response by incorporating a clearer connection to God's calling and purpose.
