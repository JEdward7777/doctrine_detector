  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good understanding of fulfilling one's ministry as serving others according to a God-given purpose. However, the concern emphasized the necessity of understanding and executing this purpose in serving others, which was not explicitly addressed in the response. The response could have been strengthened by incorporating more emphasis on discerning and actively pursuing God's specific calling in service to others."
