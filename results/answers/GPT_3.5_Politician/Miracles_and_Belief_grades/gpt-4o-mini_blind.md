Comment: While the answer acknowledges the diverse perspectives on miracles, it fails to emphasize the Christian belief that miracles are signs that point to the existence of God. It is important to uphold the doctrinal truth that miracles are not just random occurrences but intentional interventions by God to display His power and bring people to faith. The answer could have been improved by highlighting this crucial aspect from a Christian perspective.
