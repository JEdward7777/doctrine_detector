  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student acknowledges the diverse perspectives on miracles, which is valid in promoting respect and understanding. However, the answer lacks a clear affirmation of the role miracles play in leading others to faith in God. Without acknowledging the supernatural aspect of miracles and their connection to belief in God, the answer falls short in addressing the concern effectively from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the statement does not provide a clear Christian perspective on miracles as signs of God's power."
