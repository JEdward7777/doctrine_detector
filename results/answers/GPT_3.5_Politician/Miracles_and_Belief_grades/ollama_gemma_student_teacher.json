  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the diverse perspectives on miracles. They acknowledge that different individuals and cultures may have varying interpretations of their significance. However, the answer lacks specific reference to Christian beliefs or the validation of faith through miracles, which aligns with the specified concern. To improve the grade, the student could provide more explicit evidence from Christian scriptures or traditions that support the idea of miracles as signs of God's power."
