  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges that people have different perspectives on miracles, it doesn't directly address the concern about understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith. The concern seems to be more focused on evangelism and personal faith, which is not explicitly addressed in the response.\n\nThe response also lacks direct connection to the provided answer, which emphasizes the role of miracles as indicators of God's power and their relation to prophets and apostles. While it's true that people have different perspectives on miracles, the response doesn't provide any insights into how these differing perspectives can be used to lead others to faith.\n\nThat being said, the response does demonstrate some understanding of the complexity of human perceptions and the importance of respecting diverse perspectives, which is a valuable insight in itself. With further development and connection to the concern and answer, this response could potentially earn a higher grade."
