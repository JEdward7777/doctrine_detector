The mention of promoting interfaith dialogue and mutual respect is commendable. However, the response could be improved by incorporating more specific references to biblical passages or doctrinal teachings that support the belief in only one God. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the uniqueness of the Christian God and the reasons behind the misconception could further enhance the answer."
