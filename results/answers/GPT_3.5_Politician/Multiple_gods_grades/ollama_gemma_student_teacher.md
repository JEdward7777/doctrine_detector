**Comment:** 
The student's answer adequately addresses the concern of correcting misunderstandings without compromising Christian doctrine. It clearly explains Christianity's monotheistic nature and emphasizes the importance of understanding and respecting other faiths. Additionally, suggesting educational resources and open discussions demonstrates a practical and inclusive approach to addressing the misconception. However, including a direct reference to biblical teaching and the doctrine of the Trinity would have strengthened the response.
