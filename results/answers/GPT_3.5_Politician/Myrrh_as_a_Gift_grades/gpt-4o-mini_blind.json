However, it does not fully capture the Christian perspective on myrrh as a gift given to Jesus, which also symbolizes his future death and role as the Savior of the world. The answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the prophetic aspect of myrrh in connection to Jesus's ultimate sacrifice for humanity's redemption."
