75.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's response as 75.

While the student correctly mentions the symbolism of suffering related to myrrh, they miss explicitly connecting it to Jesus' future suffering and death. The student acknowledges the symbolic significance of myrrh but does not fully address its specific relevance to Jesus' purpose and mission. Overall, the student demonstrates an understanding of myrrh's general symbolism but falls short of explicitly tying it to Jesus' sacrificial role as the Messiah.
