  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good understanding of Jesus as the image of God in Christian belief, focusing on qualities such as love, compassion, forgiveness, and selflessness. However, the answer lacks the crucial aspect of Jesus being God Himself and sharing the same essence with God the Father, emphasizing his divinity and role in salvation. Encouraging emulation of Jesus' example is commendable, but the student should have elaborated more on the theological aspect of Jesus being the image of God in a Christian worldview."
