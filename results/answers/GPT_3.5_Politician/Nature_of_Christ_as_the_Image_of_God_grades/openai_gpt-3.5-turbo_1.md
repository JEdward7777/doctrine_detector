This concept emphasizes the idea that Jesus serves as a role model for believers to follow in their own lives.

The significance of this belief is that it encourages Christians to strive to emulate Jesus' example by treating others with kindness, showing mercy, and practicing humility. By living in accordance with these values, Christians believe they can better reflect the image of God and fulfill their purpose in the world.
