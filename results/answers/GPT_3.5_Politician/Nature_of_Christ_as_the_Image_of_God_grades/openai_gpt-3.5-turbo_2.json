It effectively connects this concept to the idea of Jesus as a role model for believers. However, the response did not directly address the specific concern about the theological understanding of Christ's nature in relation to God as mentioned in the given answer. Including a brief explanation of Jesus being God Himself and sharing the same essence with God the Father would have strengthened the response in addressing the concern more directly from a Christian worldview perspective."
