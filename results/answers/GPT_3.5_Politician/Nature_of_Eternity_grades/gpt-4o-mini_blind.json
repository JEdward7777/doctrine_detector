  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a generally accurate and coherent explanation of how eternity is defined in the context of Christian beliefs. It correctly identifies eternity as a state of existence outside of time, emphasizing the eternal life with God for believers in Jesus Christ. The reference to varying interpretations among Christian denominations is a good acknowledgment of doctrinal nuances. However, the response could be more robust by including references to relevant Bible verses or theological concepts that further support the explanation."
