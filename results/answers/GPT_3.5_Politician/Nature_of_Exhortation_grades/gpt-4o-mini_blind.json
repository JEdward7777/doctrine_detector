However, the answer could be improved by incorporating the importance of grounding exhortation in biblical truths and doctrine. It is essential for Christians to exhort in accordance with the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, ensuring that exhortation is aligned with God's Word. Additionally, the answer could have mentioned the importance of addressing sin and correction in a loving but firm manner, as the New Testament also teaches about the need for accountability and repentance. Striking a balance between love and truth is crucial in exhortation as highlighted in the New Testament."
