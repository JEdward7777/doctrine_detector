  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student's response captures the essence of approaching exhortation with love, compassion, and understanding as taught in the New Testament, there is a lack of specificity compared to the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer includes important elements such as respect, non-judgmental attitude, and supportive guidance, which align well with Christian principles. However, the reference answer focuses more directly on exhorting in love without harshness or abruptness, which is a key point emphasized in the New Testament teachings.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian approach to exhortation, but could improve by being more concise and precise in aligning with the specific teaching highlighted in the reference answer."
