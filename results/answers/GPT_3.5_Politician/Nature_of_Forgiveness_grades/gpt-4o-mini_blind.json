However, the response lacks depth in connecting Jesus's teachings to the core Christian doctrine of redemption through Christ's sacrifice. A stronger emphasis on the sacrificial aspect of forgiveness and how it reveals the justice and holiness of God would have enhanced the overall theological depth of the answer. Additionally, there could have been more specific references to biblical passages or theological concepts to support the argument."
