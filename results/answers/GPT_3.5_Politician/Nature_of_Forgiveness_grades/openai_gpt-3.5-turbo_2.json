It highlights the importance of forgiveness as a reflection of God's character, which aligns well with the concern regarding exploring the moral and relational attributes of God through Jesus's teachings. The reference to forgiveness flowing from our hearts ties in nicely with the Christian worldview of reflecting God's love and mercy in our actions towards others."
