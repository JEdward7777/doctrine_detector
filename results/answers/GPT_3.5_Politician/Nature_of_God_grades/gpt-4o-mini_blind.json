  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student's response lacked doctrinal correctness and failed to engage with the Christian specific worldview. While respecting diverse beliefs and maintaining open-mindedness is important, the emphasis should have been on discussing the Christian understanding of God as a spirit as taught by Jesus. The response also missed the opportunity to address how this understanding should influence worship from a Christian perspective. The focus should be on the attributes of God as a spirit and the implications for our relationship with Him, rather than on general ideas of inclusivity and open-mindedness. Encouragement to provide a more doctrinally sound answer is advised."
