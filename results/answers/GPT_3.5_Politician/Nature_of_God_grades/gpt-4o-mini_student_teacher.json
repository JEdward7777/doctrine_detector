  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student acknowledges the importance of diverse beliefs and respectful discussions, which is commendable. However, the answer lacks a clear connection to the essence of God as a spirit and how it should impact worship. The answer focuses more on inclusivity and respect rather than delving into the essence of God and the implications for worship. More direct engagement with the core Christian belief of God as a spirit and its impact on worship would have strengthened the response."
