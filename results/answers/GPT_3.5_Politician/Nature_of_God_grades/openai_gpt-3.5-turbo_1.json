However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the essence of God as a spirit to the importance of personal relationship, reverence, and adoration in worship. There is a good attempt to address the concern from a Christian perspective, but it could have been articulated more directly and with clear references to biblical teachings on worship."
