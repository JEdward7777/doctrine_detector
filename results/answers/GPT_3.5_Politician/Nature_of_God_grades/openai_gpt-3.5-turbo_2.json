It lacks a solid foundation in Christian theology and the specific teachings of Jesus, which are crucial in understanding the essence of God and how to approach worship from a Christian worldview. The emphasis on respect for differing beliefs is commendable but should not overshadow the importance of presenting a coherent Christian perspective on the topic at hand."
