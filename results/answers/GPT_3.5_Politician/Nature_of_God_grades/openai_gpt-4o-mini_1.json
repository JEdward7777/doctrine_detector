However, it falls short in providing specific guidance on how to appropriately connect with God in worship from a Christian perspective. It lacks a clear Christian worldview in addressing the concern raised. Encouraging respect for differing viewpoints is important, but in a Christian context, discussing the uniqueness of Jesus as the way to God could enhance the response."
