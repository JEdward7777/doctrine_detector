  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear understanding of the severity and purpose of hell as described in the Bible from a Christian worldview. While acknowledging diverse interpretations is important, the response needed to address the specific concerns about the nature of hell as a place of punishment for those who reject God and Jesus. The student did not adequately engage with the Christian perspective regarding judgment and salvation in relation to hell."
