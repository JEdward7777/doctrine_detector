  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a solid answer that accurately described the appearance and taste of manna as stated in the Bible. However, they included an extra detail about the similarity to coriander seed, which was not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding of the biblical description of manna and its significance in relation to God's miraculous provision."
