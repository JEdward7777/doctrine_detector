Comment: The response correctly identifies that manna was described as tasting sweet like honey, which is accurate. However, it fails to mention that manna was also described as white flakes and that it appeared like coriander seed in the Bible. To fully demonstrate an understanding of the miraculous provision of God as depicted in the scriptures, it is important to include these additional details.
