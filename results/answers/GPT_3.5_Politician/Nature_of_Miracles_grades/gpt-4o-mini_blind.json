  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The answer provided acknowledges various perspectives and promotes openness and dialogue, which is commendable. However, the response lacks doctrinal correctness in a Christian worldview. It fails to explicitly state the core Christian belief that Jesus' miracles reveal His identity as the Son of God, demonstrating his divinity, power over nature, and compassion for humanity. It is important to communicate this foundational Christian belief clearly when discussing Jesus' miracles from a Christian perspective."
