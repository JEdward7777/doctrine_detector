The original answer posits that Jesus' miracles reveal His divinity and Messiahship, which aligns with the concern. However, the LLM response does not engage with this interpretation or provide any insight into why Jesus' miracles are significant for affirming His divine nature. While it acknowledges the importance of understanding different perspectives, it falls short in providing a meaningful discussion on the topic."
