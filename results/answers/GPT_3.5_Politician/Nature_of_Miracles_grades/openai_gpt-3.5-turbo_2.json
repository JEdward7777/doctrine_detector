It emphasizes the Christian belief that Jesus is God and the Messiah, which is essential to understanding His miracles from a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly addressing the concern with more depth or explanation, but overall, it demonstrates a strong alignment with the Christian perspective on Jesus' miracles."
