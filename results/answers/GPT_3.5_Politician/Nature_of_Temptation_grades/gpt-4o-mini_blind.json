From a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the inherent sinful nature inherited from the fall of Adam and Eve, which predisposes individuals to temptation. Additionally, external influences must be viewed through the lens of spiritual warfare and the need for discernment in navigating worldly influences. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more explicit references to biblical teachings on the nature of sin and the importance of resisting temptation through reliance on God's grace."
