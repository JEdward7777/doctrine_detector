  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the complexity of temptation, acknowledging both internal (sinful nature) and external (societal pressures, cultural norms, personal relationships) factors. However, the student could have incorporated more explicitly Christian concepts such as the role of Satan in tempting individuals, as mentioned in the reference answer. Emphasizing the fallen nature of humanity and the influence of evil forces would have strengthened the Christian perspective in the response."
