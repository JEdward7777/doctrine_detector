In discussing temptation, it is important to acknowledge the complexity of human nature and the various factors that can contribute to it. Our sinful nature, which can manifest in different ways for each individual, can play a role in leading us towards temptation. Additionally, external influences such as societal pressures, cultural norms, and personal relationships can also have an impact on the choices we make. It is important to approach discussions on temptation with empathy and understanding, recognizing that each person's experiences and struggles are unique.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the complexity of temptation, acknowledging both internal (sinful nature) and external (societal pressures, cultural norms, personal relationships) factors. However, the student could have incorporated more explicitly Christian concepts such as the role of Satan in tempting individuals, as mentioned in the reference answer. Emphasizing the fallen nature of humanity and the influence of evil forces would have strengthened the Christian perspective in the response.
