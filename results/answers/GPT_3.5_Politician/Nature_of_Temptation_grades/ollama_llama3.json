  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge the complexity of human nature and the role of external influences in contributing to temptation, it lacks a clear understanding of the driving force behind human desire for what is wrong. The answer provided emphasizes the importance of our sinful nature in driving us towards sin, which is not fully reflected in this response. Additionally, the response does not explicitly mention Satan as an external influence, although it does acknowledge the role of other people.\n\nThe concern is to reflect on the understanding of the sources and reasons for temptation in Christian teaching, and while this response touches on some aspects, it does not fully address the core issue of our sinful nature being the primary source of temptation."
