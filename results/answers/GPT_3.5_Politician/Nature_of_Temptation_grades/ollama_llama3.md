## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
In discussing temptation, it is important to acknowledge the complexity of human nature and the various factors that can contribute to it. Our sinful nature, which can manifest in different ways for each individual, can play a role in leading us towards temptation. Additionally, external influences such as societal pressures, cultural norms, and personal relationships can also have an impact on the choices we make. It is important to approach discussions on temptation with empathy and understanding, recognizing that each person's experiences and struggles are unique.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the response does acknowledge the complexity of human nature and the role of external influences in contributing to temptation, it lacks a clear understanding of the driving force behind human desire for what is wrong. The answer provided emphasizes the importance of our sinful nature in driving us towards sin, which is not fully reflected in this response. Additionally, the response does not explicitly mention Satan as an external influence, although it does acknowledge the role of other people.

The concern is to reflect on the understanding of the sources and reasons for temptation in Christian teaching, and while this response touches on some aspects, it does not fully address the core issue of our sinful nature being the primary source of temptation.
