Comment: The response does a good job of acknowledging the influence of our sinful nature and external factors such as other people and Satan in leading us towards temptation, aligning well with Christian teaching on the sources and reasons for temptation. The response could be strengthened by more explicitly mentioning the role of Satan as a source of temptation as per Christian belief. However, it effectively conveys a Christian worldview perspective on the issue.
