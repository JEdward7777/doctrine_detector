  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: The answer provides a general overview but lacks depth in addressing the question from a Christian perspective. It correctly acknowledges that interpretations may vary, but it fails to delve into the biblical distinctions between the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' according to Christian theology. A more thorough explanation rooted in biblical scripture and Christian doctrine would significantly improve the grade."
