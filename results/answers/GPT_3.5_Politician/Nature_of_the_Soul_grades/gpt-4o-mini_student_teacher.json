  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks clarity and depth in addressing the biblical definitions of 'soul' and 'spirit'. While the student acknowledges differing interpretations, they do not provide a clear explanation of how the Bible differentiates between the two concepts. The emphasis on sensitivity and respect is commendable, but the response falls short in addressing the specific concern of understanding the biblical definitions for accurate interpretation."
