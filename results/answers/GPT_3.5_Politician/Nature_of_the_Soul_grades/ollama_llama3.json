  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts of soul and spirit, acknowledging that they may be used interchangeably or distinguished in different interpretations. It also recognizes the importance of considering diverse perspectives when discussing religious beliefs. However, it could have gone further to explicitly address how these terms relate to human nature and our relationship with God, which is the primary concern. The response's focus on general approaches to discussion and interpretation falls slightly short of fully addressing the concern. Nevertheless, its overall clarity and sensitivity to different perspectives earn it a solid grade."
