  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as outlined in Numbers 6:1-4. The inclusion of abstaining from wine and other fermented drinks, avoiding grapes and grape products, refraining from cutting hair, and staying away from anything unclean is on point. The clarification that these restrictions are voluntarily chosen by individuals taking on the Nazirite vow is also a good addition. The grade is slightly lower due to missing the mention of avoiding contact with the dead, which is also a crucial restriction within the Nazirite vow specified in Numbers 6:6-8."
