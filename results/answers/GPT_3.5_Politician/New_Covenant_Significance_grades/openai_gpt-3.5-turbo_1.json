  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the significance of the new covenant established through Jesus and correctly highlights the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in contrast to the old covenant sacrifices. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the atoning power of Jesus' sacrifice in relation to God's promises. The mention of the eternal atonement for people's sins aligns well with a Christian worldview. The grade could be higher if the response delved more into the specific promises of God that are fulfilled through Jesus' sacrifice."
