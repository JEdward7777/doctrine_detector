  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a general understanding of the importance of Psalms in a Christian's spiritual journey, but it misses the specific instruction regarding singing psalms as a form of worship found in the New Testament. The student's answer lacks the direct connection to contemporary Christian worship, which is the specified concern. It is important for the student to focus on the specific biblical teachings and their application to modern worship practices in order to fully address the concern."
