Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the concept of every believer being considered a priest in the New Testament, highlighting the idea of direct access to God and intercession. The mention of the priesthood of all believers and the affirmation of the dignity of each individual is well articulated. However, it could be strengthened by emphasizing the biblical basis for this concept, such as referencing 1 Peter 2:9 which states that believers are a "royal priesthood." Additionally, linking this concept to the role of Old Testament priests and the fulfillment of that in Christ would further enhance the explanation.
