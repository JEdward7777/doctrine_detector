  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers, accurately explaining that every believer in Jesus is considered a priest who can come directly to God in prayer. The explanation also highlights the idea of intercession on behalf of others, which is an important aspect of this concept.\n\nThe only deductions I would make are for a lack of elaboration and supporting examples. While the response provides a clear summary of the concept, it could be strengthened by providing more detail or specific biblical examples to further illustrate this idea."
