Thank you for your question. In the Christian faith, the concept of every believer in Jesus being considered a priest in the New Testament is often seen as a metaphorical representation of the believer's direct access to God and the ability to intercede on behalf of others. This idea highlights the belief in the priesthood of all believers, emphasizing the equal value and importance of each individual's relationship with God. It is a way to affirm the dignity and spiritual significance of every person within the faith community.

I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers, accurately explaining that every believer in Jesus is considered a priest who can come directly to God in prayer. The explanation also highlights the idea of intercession on behalf of others, which is an important aspect of this concept.

The only deductions I would make are for a lack of elaboration and supporting examples. While the response provides a clear summary of the concept, it could be strengthened by providing more detail or specific biblical examples to further illustrate this idea.
