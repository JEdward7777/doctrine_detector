  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a decent comparison between the concept of purification in the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the shift from external rituals to internal transformation. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, which is the main concern raised in the reference answer. The student could improve by explicitly connecting the idea of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate means of purification in the New Testament."
