  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately identifies relevant textual evidence from the New Testament that suggests parallels between John the Baptist's practices and Nazirite customs. However, the response lacks a deeper analysis of the textual evidence and does not explicitly connect it to the concern of connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures. The conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly stating that the New Testament does indeed suggest that John the Baptist was a Nazirite."
