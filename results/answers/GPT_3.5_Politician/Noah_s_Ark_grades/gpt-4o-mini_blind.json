However, it lacks depth and specificity regarding the primary purpose of the Ark as described in the Bible, which was to serve as a means of salvation from the worldwide flood that God sent as judgment on a sinful world. The answer could be improved by focusing more on the historical and theological significance of the Ark within the Biblical narrative."
