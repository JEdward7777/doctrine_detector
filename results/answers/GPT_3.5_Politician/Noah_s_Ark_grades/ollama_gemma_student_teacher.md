## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately identifies the primary purpose of Noah's Ark as divine protection and preservation. However, it lacks a deeper exploration of the narrative's connection to God's plan for salvation and preservation. The student's response would benefit from elaborating on the concept of God's judgment and redemption in the context of the story.
