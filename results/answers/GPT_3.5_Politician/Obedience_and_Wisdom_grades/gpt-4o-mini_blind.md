40.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The response lacks specificity and fails to address the question from a Christian worldview. It presents a relativistic view by emphasizing diverse perspectives rather than grounding wisdom in a biblical understanding of listening to God through prayer, studying Scripture, and seeking His guidance. The importance of submitting to God's will as the source of true wisdom is overlooked, leading to a lower grade.
