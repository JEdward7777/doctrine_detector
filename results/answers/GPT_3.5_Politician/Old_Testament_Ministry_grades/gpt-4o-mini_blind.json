However, it lacks depth and specificity regarding the theological significance and biblical requirements for priestly duties. It could be improved by including references to specific Old Testament passages and highlighting the priestly functions as outlined in the Levitical law. Additionally, the answer should emphasize the spiritual symbolism and foreshadowing of Christ's work as the ultimate High Priest in the New Testament."
