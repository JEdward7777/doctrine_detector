  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's answer touches on the general duties of priests in the Old Testament, it lacks depth and specific details compared to the reference answer. The response somewhat acknowledges the importance of sacrifices and ceremonies but fails to emphasize the direct connection between the priests' ministry and their service to God. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to connect these practices to current ministry approaches and sacrificial service as per the specified concern. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the theological significance of the priestly role and how it informs present-day Christian ministry practices would enhance their understanding from a Christian worldview."
