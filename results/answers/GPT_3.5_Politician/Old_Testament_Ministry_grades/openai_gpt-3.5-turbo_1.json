It aligns well with the concern provided, which emphasizes how understanding the practices of the Old Testament can shape current ministry approaches and the concept of sacrificial service. However, there could have been a deeper exploration of how these practices can specifically influence and guide modern Christian ministry in a more comprehensive manner."
