  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a generally accurate comparison of the concept of atonement in the Old and New Testaments. However, the student's answer lacked specificity in addressing the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The student could have elaborated more on the significance of Christ's sacrifice as the fulfillment and culmination of atonement, replacing the temporary sacrifices of the Old Testament with a permanent solution for sin."
