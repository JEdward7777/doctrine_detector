  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the difference between the Old and New Testament concepts of atonement. They clearly explain the temporary nature of animal sacrifices in the Old Testament and how Christ's sacrifice is seen as the ultimate and permanent atonement in the New Testament. The response is well-written and respectful of different perspectives."
