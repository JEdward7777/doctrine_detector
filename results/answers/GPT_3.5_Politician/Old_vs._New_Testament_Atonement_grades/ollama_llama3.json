  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does touch on the concept of atonement in both the Old and New Testaments, it falls short of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The provided answer mentions that the Old Testament taught temporary blood sacrifices, while the New Testament teaches that Christ's single sacrifice is sufficient for all sins forever. However, this response does not explicitly address how these two concepts relate to each other or provide a clear explanation of how the transition from temporary to permanent atonement occurred.\n\nThe concern about clarifying the transition between the Old and New Testaments is partially addressed in the response, but it could be more thoroughly explored and developed. The writer mentions that interpretations can vary among different religious traditions, which is a good point, but does not delve deeper into the biblical texts to provide a clear explanation of this transition.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some general information about atonement in the Old and New Testaments, it could be more detailed and specific in addressing the concern about clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement."
