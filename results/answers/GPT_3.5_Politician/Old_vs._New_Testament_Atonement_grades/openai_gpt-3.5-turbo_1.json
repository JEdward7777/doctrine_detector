It accurately contrasts the Old Testament's temporary blood sacrifices with the New Testament's teaching on Christ's single sacrifice being sufficient for all sins forever. The response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern raised and clarifying more explicitly how the transition from temporary to permanent atonement is significant within the Christian worldview."
