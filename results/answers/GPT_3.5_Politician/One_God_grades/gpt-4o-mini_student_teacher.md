Grade: 70

Comment: The student's answer acknowledges the need for cultural sensitivity in translating the Bible for polytheistic cultures, which is commendable. However, the response lacks a strong emphasis on the biblical truth of monotheism and the unique nature of God, such as the concept of the Trinity. Reinforcing the importance of maintaining biblical monotheism without compromise is key when addressing cultural polytheism. The student could improve their answer by incorporating more explicitly Christian-specific elements in emphasizing the concept of "One God."
