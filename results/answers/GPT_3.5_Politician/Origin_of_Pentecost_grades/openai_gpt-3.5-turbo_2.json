However, it falls short in connecting this festival to its fulfillment in Christ. A Christian worldview would emphasize how Pentecost symbolizes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on believers, as seen in Acts 2, fulfilling Jesus' promise to send the Advocate. Making this connection would enhance the response and provide a deeper understanding of the significance of Pentecost for Christians."
