To fully align with a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to include how Pentecost, as the New Testament fulfillment of the Festival of Weeks, symbolizes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the Christian church. By incorporating this connection, the response would better reflect the Christian perspective on the Festival of Weeks."
