  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer did not directly address the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness in the context of God's forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ. Instead, the response focused on the importance of respecting diverse perspectives and did not provide a clear explanation of how pardon relates to God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ according to the Christian worldview."
