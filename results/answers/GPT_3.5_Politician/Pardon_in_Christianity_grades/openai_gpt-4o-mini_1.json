The response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of this relationship and the central role it plays in Christian faith. The emphasis on respecting diverse perspectives and promoting inclusivity is commendable. Just a slight deduction for not delving deeper into the theological implications of the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness."
