Thank you for your question. The celebration of Passover holds significant meaning for Christians as well, as it represents the freedom and redemption brought by Jesus Christ through his sacrifice and resurrection. Christians see parallels between the Passover story in the Old Testament, where the Israelites were freed from slavery in Egypt, and the story of Jesus, who liberated humanity from sin and death. It is a time for reflection on the ultimate sacrifice made by Jesus for the salvation of all people, regardless of faith tradition.
