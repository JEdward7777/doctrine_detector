  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the Old Testament Passover to the New Testament revelation of Jesus, highlighting the significance of Jesus as the Passover Lamb. While it does not explicitly state the connection between the two, it provides a clear and accurate understanding of Christ's sacrifice and its relevance to salvation. The response also demonstrates a good grasp of Christian theology, acknowledging Jesus' sinless sacrifice and its universal applicability.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have explicitly stated the parallels between the Old Testament Passover and the New Testament revelation of Jesus, further emphasizing the redemptive significance of His sacrifice. However, as it stands, the response provides a clear and coherent explanation of Jesus' role in the Passover celebration."
