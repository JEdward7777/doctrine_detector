  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student effectively discusses the importance of perseverance and determination in faith and ministry as seen in the stoning of Paul in Lystra. They touch on the need to remain steadfast in the face of adversity and highlight the significance of cultural sensitivity in sharing one's beliefs. However, the student's answer lacks depth and specificity compared to the reference answer. It would have been beneficial for them to delve further into the implications for one's faith journey and ministry work."
