It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The response could be further enhanced by including specific biblical references or examples to support the points made. Overall, a solid understanding of purification from a Christian worldview is demonstrated."
