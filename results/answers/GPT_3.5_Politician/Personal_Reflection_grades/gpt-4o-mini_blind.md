Grade: 60

Comments: The student has provided a good analysis of the general meaning of the expression "woe is me" in conveying distress or lamentation. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to recognize that suffering and distress can also be a result of sin, whether personal or collective. The answer could have been improved by including this aspect and emphasizing the potential connection between personal suffering and the presence of sin.
