  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer correctly identifies that the expression \"woe is me\" conveys distress and sadness, but it falls short in connecting this expression to an awareness of personal sin. From a Christian perspective, the expression can indeed imply recognition of personal sin and its consequences, which the student failed to emphasize in their response. The student could improve their answer by incorporating the Christian worldview's perspective on sin and suffering."
