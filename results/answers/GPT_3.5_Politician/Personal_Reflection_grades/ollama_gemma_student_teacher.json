  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately explains the general meaning of the expression \"woe is me\" as conveying distress or sadness. However, it lacks nuance and fails to fully capture the spiritual dimension of the expression as it relates to awareness of sin. The reference answer provides a more precise and theological understanding of the expression in the context of recognizing severe suffering or the consequences of sins."
