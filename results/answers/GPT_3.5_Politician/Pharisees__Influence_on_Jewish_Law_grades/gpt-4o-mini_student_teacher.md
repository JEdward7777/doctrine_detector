Comment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the differing perspectives within the Pharisees toward Jesus and early Christians. However, the answer lacks specificity in addressing how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses impacted their relationship with Jesus and early Christians. A stronger connection between the Pharisees' interpretation of the law and the conflicts with Jesus would have been more impactful.
