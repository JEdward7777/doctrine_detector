Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the letter of the law brought about conflicts with Jesus and early Christians. The perspective aligns with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the importance of understanding the Pharisees' role in Jesus' ministry. However, the response could have further emphasized the Pharisees' internal divisions and the importance of fostering understanding and mutual respect within religious groups, which would have enriched the analysis from a Christian perspective.
