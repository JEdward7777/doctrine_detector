It also advocates for promoting understanding and mutual respect among individuals of different faith traditions, which aligns with the Christian value of love and respect for others. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the importance of retaining biblical terminology and ensuring accuracy in teaching to prevent doctrinal errors."
