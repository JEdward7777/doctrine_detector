The explanation provided is clear and aligns with Christian doctrine. The suggestion to explore different interpretations and meanings of the term in various religious contexts contributes to a comprehensive understanding. Overall, the response promotes accurate and respectful teaching to prevent doctrinal errors and uphold biblical terminology."
