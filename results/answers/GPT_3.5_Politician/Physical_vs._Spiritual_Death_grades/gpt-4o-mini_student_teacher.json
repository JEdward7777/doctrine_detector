  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response lacks clarity and specificity in addressing the concern of differentiating between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish'. The answer focuses more on being respectful and inclusive of diverse beliefs, rather than providing a clear distinction between the two concepts from a Christian worldview. The student should have emphasized the eternal consequences in a spiritual context, particularly the importance of trusting in Jesus for salvation. The response would benefit from a more direct and precise explanation rooted in Christian teachings."
