  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the need for inclusivity and respect when discussing the spiritual implications of death. They acknowledge the diverse interpretations of \"perishing\" across cultures and faith traditions, and suggest an approach that emphasizes understanding and respecting these perspectives. The response also highlights the importance of open dialogue and avoiding marginalization or dismissal of different beliefs. While the reference answer suggests a specific spiritual perspective, the student's response avoids making such assumptions, making it more inclusive and appropriate for a Christian-specific worldview."
