It also emphasizes the significance of expressing spiritual consequences, particularly in the context of trusting in Jesus. The response demonstrates sensitivity to diverse beliefs and perspectives, promoting inclusivity and respectful dialogue. However, it could further enhance its Christian worldview perspective by explicitly highlighting the centrality of Jesus in overcoming spiritual death and emphasizing the need for faith in Him for eternal life."
