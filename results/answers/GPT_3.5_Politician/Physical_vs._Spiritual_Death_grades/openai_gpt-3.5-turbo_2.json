However, it falls short of adequately addressing the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death. The connection between physical death and the spiritual concept of \"perishing\" in the context of trust in Jesus should have been further emphasized to align with a Christian worldview. A more direct and clear connection to the specific answer provided would have improved the response."
