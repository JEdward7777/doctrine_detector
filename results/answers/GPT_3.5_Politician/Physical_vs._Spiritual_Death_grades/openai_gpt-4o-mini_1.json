  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and perspectives, which is commendable. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding. The response could have explicitly highlighted the significance of trusting in Jesus for avoiding spiritual perishing, emphasizing the eternal consequences involved. Strengthening the connection between the specific answer given and the concern raised would have improved the grade."
