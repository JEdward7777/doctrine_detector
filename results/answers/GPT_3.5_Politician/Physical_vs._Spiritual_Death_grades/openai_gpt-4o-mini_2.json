However, it could have been stronger by directly addressing the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding. Encouraging a deeper exploration of how the spiritual aspect of \"perishing\" relates to eternal consequences would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
