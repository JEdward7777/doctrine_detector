  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 85.\n\nThe answer correctly highlights some important ways in which early Christians expressed their fellowship, such as acts of kindness, charity, communal gatherings, and support for one another. However, it could be improved by mentioning the significance of the early Christians partaking in the Eucharist or Lord's Supper as a central element of their fellowship gatherings. Additionally, emphasizing the role of prayer, sharing of spiritual gifts, and mutual encouragement within the fellowship would further enhance the answer's depth and doctrinal correctness. Overall, a solid response but could benefit from a deeper theological perspective."
