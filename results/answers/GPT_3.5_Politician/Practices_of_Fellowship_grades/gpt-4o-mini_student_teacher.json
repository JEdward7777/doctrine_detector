However, the reference answer focuses more specifically on listening to God's Word, praying together, and sharing belongings, which are key aspects of fellowship that were prominent among early Christians. Integrating these elements into the student's response would have strengthened their understanding of how fellowship was practiced among early Christians from a Christian worldview perspective."
