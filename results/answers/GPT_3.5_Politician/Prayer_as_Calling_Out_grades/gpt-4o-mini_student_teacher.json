  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer fails to address the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life from a Christian perspective. The answer, while promoting inclusivity, misses the core essence of what it means to 'call out to the Lord' in Christian belief. The importance of trust, urgency, and dependence on God is not clearly articulated in the response."
