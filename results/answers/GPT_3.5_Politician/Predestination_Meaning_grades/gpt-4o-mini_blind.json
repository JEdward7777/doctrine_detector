However, the explanation could be strengthened by emphasizing the biblical basis for the doctrine of predestination, such as citing key verses like Romans 8:29-30 and Ephesians 1:5. Additionally, the sensitivity towards differing views on this topic is commendable, as it is indeed a debated issue within Christianity."
