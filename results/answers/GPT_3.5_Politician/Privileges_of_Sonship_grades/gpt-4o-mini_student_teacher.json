  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively captures the privileges adopted children of God receive as mentioned in Romans 8:14-15, emphasizing the relationship aspect. The response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the passage. However, the teacher's reference answer provided a concise and specific response that directly focused on the personal and intimate relationship aspect highlighted in the scripture. As such, a slightly higher grade would have been awarded if the student's answer closely aligned with the reference answer in terms of specificity and precision."
