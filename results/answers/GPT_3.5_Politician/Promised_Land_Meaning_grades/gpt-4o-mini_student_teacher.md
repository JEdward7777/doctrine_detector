Comment: The student correctly identifies the Promised Land as the land of Canaan promised to Abraham and his descendants. However, there is a lack of depth in explaining the spiritual and covenantal significance of this promise in relation to God's faithfulness and provision for his chosen people. Encouraging further elaboration on the theological implications would enhance the response.
