  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70.\n\nWhile the student did correctly identify that the term \"Daughter of Zion\" is used to refer to the Jewish people or Jerusalem in Biblical prophecies and mentioned the spiritual relationship between God and His people, they missed the importance of the term in conveying messages of hope or warning as per the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the comment about being respectful and sensitive, while valid, does not directly address the concern of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context in applying scriptures today. The response lacked depth and a deeper analysis of the term in its prophetic context."
