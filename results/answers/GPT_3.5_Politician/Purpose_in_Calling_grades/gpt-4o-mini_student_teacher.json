  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response that emphasized the importance of self-reflection and seeking guidance from mentors and spiritual leaders. However, the student missed incorporating key elements from a Christian perspective such as the essential role of prayer, studying Scripture, and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit in discerning one's calling. Encouraging the student to strengthen the answer with these components would align it more closely with a Christian worldview."
