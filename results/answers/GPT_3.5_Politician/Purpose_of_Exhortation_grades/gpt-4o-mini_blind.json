However, it could be improved by explicitly mentioning that the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to call believers to faithfulness and obedience to God's commands, leading them to deeper intimacy with Him and stronger commitment to following Christ. It would have been stronger if it also mentioned the role of exhortation in correcting, rebuking, and teaching in love, in line with passages like 2 Timothy 3:16-17."
