**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** While the student's answer correctly states that exhortation serves to encourage and motivate individuals, it lacks nuance and fails to capture the broader theological purpose of exhortation in the New Testament. Exhortation primarily aims to persuade others to adhere to God's will and avoid sin, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the student's response lacks specific examples or textual references from the New Testament to support this claim.
