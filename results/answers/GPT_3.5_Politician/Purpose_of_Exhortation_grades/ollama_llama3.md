Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the role of exhortation in encouraging individuals to live virtuously and strive for personal growth, which is close to the correct answer. However, it does not explicitly state that the primary purpose of exhortation is to persuade others to avoid sin and follow God's will, as stated in the correct answer. Additionally, while the response touches on the idea of spiritual fulfillment, it does not directly address the concern of understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey.

To improve the grade, the response could provide more explicit connections between exhortation and the biblical call to avoid sin and follow God's will, as well as provide specific examples or scriptural references that demonstrate how exhortation is used in the Bible to encourage believers.
