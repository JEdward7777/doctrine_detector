  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear connection to the Christian-specific understanding of holiness and living a life set apart for God's purpose. While promoting tolerance and inclusivity is important in society, the response does not address the practical application of holiness in a believer's life according to a Christian worldview. The emphasis should be on obedience to God's commands, bringing glory to Him, and being transformed by the Holy Spirit."
