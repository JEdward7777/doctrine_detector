However, it falls short of explicitly addressing the practical application of holiness in a believer's life as outlined in the given answer. There is a focus on respect, inclusivity, and unity, which are important values, but a clearer connection to the specific Christian call to live a holy life as described in the provided statement would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
