However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of the practical application of holiness in a believer's life as highlighted in the specific answer provided. The connection between living a holy life, following God's commandments, and being transformed by the Holy Spirit could have been more explicitly integrated into the politician's viewpoint on promoting tolerance and understanding within diverse faith practices."
