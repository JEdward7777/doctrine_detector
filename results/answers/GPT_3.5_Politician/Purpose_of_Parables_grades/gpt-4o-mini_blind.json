They correctly mentioned how parables were a way for Jesus to convey spiritual truths in a relatable manner, fostering introspection and growth in faith. However, to enhance their response from a Christian worldview, they could have included the aspect of parables fulfilling the prophecy in Psalm 78:2, emphasizing how Jesus used parables to reveal deeper truths to those who were spiritually receptive while concealing them from those who were hardened in their hearts. This addition would have strengthened the doctrinal correctness of their answer."
