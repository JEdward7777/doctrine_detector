However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the primary purpose of Jesus using parables was not just to convey spiritual truths in a way that could be easily understood, but also to selectively reveal truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe. The student's answer could have been improved by incorporating this aspect of Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith."
