  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of highlighting Jesus' use of parables to convey spiritual truths, emphasizing their ability to connect with listeners on a personal level and encourage introspection and growth in faith. The mention of everyday life examples also shows a good understanding of the practical application of Jesus' teachings.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger by directly addressing the concern about understanding Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith. While it touches on this topic, it could be more explicit in exploring how Jesus' use of parables relates to our own faith and spiritual growth.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and effectively conveys the importance of Jesus' parabolic teachings, but could benefit from a more direct connection to the concern about understanding those teaching methods."
