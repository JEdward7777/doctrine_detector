  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful explanation of why Jesus used parables in his teachings, emphasizing their ability to convey spiritual truths in a relatable and memorable way. It also touches on the deeper implication that parables served to reveal truth to those who believed and hide it from those who did not. The only slight deduction in grade is due to the lack of direct reference to how this understanding impacts faith, but overall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the teaching methods of Jesus and their relevance for faith."
