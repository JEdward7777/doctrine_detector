Thank you for that question. Jesus used parables in his teachings to convey spiritual truths in a way that could be easily understood and remembered by a diverse audience with varying levels of education and cultural backgrounds. By using stories and analogies from everyday life, he was able to connect with his listeners on a personal level and communicate complex ideas in a way that was accessible and engaging.
