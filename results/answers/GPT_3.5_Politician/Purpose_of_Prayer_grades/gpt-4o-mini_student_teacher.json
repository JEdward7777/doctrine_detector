  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a general understanding of the diverse purposes of prayer in the Bible and acknowledges the different beliefs individuals may hold. However, their response lacks specificity and depth in outlining the key purposes of prayer according to a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student should focus on aligning their answer more closely with the specific purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible, emphasizing key elements such as seeking wisdom, confessing sins, and interceding for others that are foundational in Christian prayer practices."
