However, the concern about recognizing the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life could have been addressed more thoroughly by including additional aspects such as seeking guidance, expressing gratitude, and seeking comfort and strength. Overall, a solid understanding of the importance of prayer in a believer's life is demonstrated."
