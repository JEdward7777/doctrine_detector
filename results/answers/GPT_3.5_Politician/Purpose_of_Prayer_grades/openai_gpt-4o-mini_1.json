  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response directly addresses the concern by outlining key purposes of prayer from a Christian perspective, including asking for mercy, seeking wisdom, confessing sins, thanking and praising God, and interceding for others. It aligns well with a Christian worldview and emphasizes the importance of prayer in a believer's life. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly referencing biblical passages related to each purpose of prayer. Overall, a solid response."
