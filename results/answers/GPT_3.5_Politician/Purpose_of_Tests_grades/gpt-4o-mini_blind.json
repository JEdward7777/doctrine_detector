  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response fails to address the question from a Christian perspective, which is the requirement for this assignment. As a result, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness and does not provide any insight into the Christian worldview on the purpose of tests allowed by God for believers. Encouraging an open-minded approach is important, but in this context, the focus should have been on presenting a Christian perspective in alignment with biblical teachings."
