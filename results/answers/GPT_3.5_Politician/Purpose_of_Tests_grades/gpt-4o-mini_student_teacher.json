  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while emphasizing respect for diverse beliefs, does not directly address the Christian perspective on the purpose of tests that God allows believers to experience. A Christian worldview would focus on the idea that tests are meant to expose sin, lead believers to repentance, and draw them closer to God. The student should have incorporated more specifically Christian viewpoints to align with the given answer and concern."
