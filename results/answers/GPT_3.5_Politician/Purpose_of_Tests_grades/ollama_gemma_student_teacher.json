  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 70\n\n**Comment:** While the student's answer demonstrates sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs, it lacks specificity in addressing the Christian perspective on the purpose of tests. It does not engage with the reference answer, which outlines the theological purpose of tests as exposure of sin and drawing closer to God. The student's answer would be more appropriate for a discussion about respecting diverse viewpoints rather than specifically addressing the theological concept of tests."
