  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The answer provides a broad overview of how the soul relates to a person's relationship with God as described in various religious traditions, including Christianity. The response acknowledges the importance of diverse perspectives and interpretations, but it lacks depth and specificity in addressing the Christian perspective specifically. The student could improve the grade by incorporating more Scriptural references and emphasizing core Christian doctrines regarding the soul and its relationship with God."
