The answer focuses more on acknowledging diversity and different perspectives rather than delving into the direct impact of the soul on one's relationship with God. Encouraging a deeper exploration of the direct implications of the soul on spiritual life and moral decisions would enhance the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
