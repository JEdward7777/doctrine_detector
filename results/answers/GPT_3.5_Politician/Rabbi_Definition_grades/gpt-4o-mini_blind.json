  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided accurate information regarding the term \"Rabbi\" historically and in the context of Jewish religious leadership. However, the answer lacks depth in explaining the significance of the term within Christian teaching. To improve the grade, the student should have incorporated how the term \"Rabbi\" is used in Christian contexts, such as referring to Jesus as a Rabbi in the New Testament or how Christian leaders may be addressed as \"Rabbi\" in certain denominations. The response could have also included how the concept of teaching and leadership associated with the term \"Rabbi\" aligns with Christian beliefs. Additionally, while sensitivity to religious traditions is important, the response should have focused more on the doctrinal distinctions between Judaism and Christianity in relation to the term \"Rabbi\" within a Christian worldview."
