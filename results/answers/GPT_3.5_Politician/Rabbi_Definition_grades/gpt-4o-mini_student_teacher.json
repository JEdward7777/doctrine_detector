However, there was a missed opportunity to make a more direct connection to Christian teaching. The response would have been improved by discussing Jesus being referred to as \"Rabbi\" in the New Testament and how His teachings were often compared to rabbinic teachings. Encouraging further exploration of the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament would have strengthened the response."
