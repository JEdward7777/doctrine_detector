  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response acknowledges the historical meaning of \"Rabbi\" and shows sensitivity to the differences in religious traditions and terminology, which aligns with the concern about understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. Additionally, it expresses a commitment to being respectful and inclusive, which is important for effective communication across different cultural and religious backgrounds.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 5 points because the response does not directly address the concern about the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. While it acknowledges the importance of understanding differences in terminology, it does not provide specific insights or examples to illustrate this point."
