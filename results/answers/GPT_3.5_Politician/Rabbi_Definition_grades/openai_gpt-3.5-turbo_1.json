The writer acknowledges the historical context and difference in terminology between Judaism and Christianity. However, the response could be strengthened by connecting the significance of rabbinic teaching to the New Testament and how it may have influenced early Christian thought or practices. Adding this connection would enhance the Christian-specific worldview perspective on the concern provided."
