  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provided a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"Rabbi\" and its significance in Jewish religious teaching. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the concern regarding the role of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament and respectfully clarified the differences in terminology between Jewish and Christian traditions. The response could have been strengthened by providing a brief overview of how rabbinic teaching influenced Christian thought and interpretation of scripture. Overall, a well-informed and respectful response."
