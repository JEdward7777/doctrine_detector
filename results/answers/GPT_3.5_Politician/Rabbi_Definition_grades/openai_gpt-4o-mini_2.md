Comment: The response provides a good explanation of the term "Rabbi" and its significance in Jewish religious teaching. The student correctly acknowledges the historical and religious context of the term. The response also effectively emphasizes the importance of respecting religious differences. However, it could have been enhanced by incorporating more explicitly Christian perspectives on the role of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament.
