Comments: The answer provides a good explanation of the significance of Jesus being referred to as a ransom in Christianity, emphasizing His sacrificial death and redemption of humanity from sin. However, the student could strengthen their response by incorporating more emphasis on the concept of atonement through Jesus' sacrifice and linking it to the theological understanding of ransom in biblical context. Additionally, mentioning the idea of substitutionary atonement and the biblical basis of ransom theology would enhance the doctrinal depth of the answer.
