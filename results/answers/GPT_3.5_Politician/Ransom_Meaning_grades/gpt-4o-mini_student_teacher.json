  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the concept of Jesus being referred to as a ransom in Christianity, emphasizing His sacrificial death for the redemption of humanity from sin. The student effectively links this concept to the idea of forgiveness and salvation through Jesus' sacrifice. However, the answer could have been improved by incorporating more direct language from the reference answer, specifically emphasizing Jesus' role in purchasing the freedom of sinful people and allowing for their redemption."
