It would have been beneficial to expand on the religious and spiritual meaning of the temple in Judaism, its role in the covenant with God, and the impact of its destruction on the Israelite community. Further exploration of the theological implications and the redemption themes associated with the temple's restoration would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
