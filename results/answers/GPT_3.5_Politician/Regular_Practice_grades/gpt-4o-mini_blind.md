Comment: This response provides a general understanding of why the apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper, emphasizing the aspects of remembrance and spiritual unity within the Christian community. However, it lacks specific references to key biblical passages and the theological significance of the Lord's Supper in relation to Christ's sacrifice.
