Comment: The student's answer correctly identifies the importance of the Lord's Supper in remembering the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and emphasizing unity within the Christian community. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning the aspect of proclaiming the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, clarifying the specific reason for establishing the Lord's Supper as stated in the teacher's answer would have strengthened the response.
