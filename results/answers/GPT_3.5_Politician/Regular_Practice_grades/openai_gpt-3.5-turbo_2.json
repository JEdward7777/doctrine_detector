However, there is room for improvement in addressing the concern by elaborating more on the impact and importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. Expanding on how the practice fosters unity, forgiveness, and gratitude within the Christian community would enhance the response further from a Christian worldview perspective."
