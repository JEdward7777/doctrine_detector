However, the response lacked a clear understanding of the specific Christian viewpoint concerning the rejection of Jesus by Jewish religious leaders, which is rooted in jealousy and fear of losing power. While promoting interfaith dialogue and respect for different perspectives is important, a stronger emphasis on the Christian belief regarding this rejection would have improved the response."
