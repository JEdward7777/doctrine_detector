However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective. To improve, the student should address the specific Christian understanding of propitiation as the appeasement of God's wrath through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, contrasting it with the broader concept of atonement as the reconciliation of humanity with God. Additionally, a clearer connection between the two terms within the framework of Christian theology would strengthen the response."
