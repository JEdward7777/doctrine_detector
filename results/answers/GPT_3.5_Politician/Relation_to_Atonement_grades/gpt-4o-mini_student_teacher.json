  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 50.\n\nWhile the student provided a general overview of both \"propitiation\" and \"atonement,\" they missed the key distinction between the two terms as requested in the concern. The reference answer specifically highlighted that propitiation emphasizes appeasing God's wrath, which the student did not address directly.\n\nThe student did acknowledge the importance and sensitivity of these concepts, which is commendable, but the lack of clarity on the differences and similarities between propitiation and atonement limits the depth of their response. It's crucial for theological discussions to accurately convey the nuances of such terms to avoid misinterpretations."
