It correctly highlights the relationship between the two terms and their theological significance. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of propitiation and atonement from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the specific sacrifice of Jesus Christ as propitiation for sin and the broader concept of atonement as reconciliation with God through faith."
