It is important for a response to provide a more focused explanation on biblical teachings, emphasizing the necessity of repentance for reconciliation with God and the understanding of God's justice and righteousness in relation to His wrath. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration and explanation of these doctrinal concepts within a Christian worldview."
