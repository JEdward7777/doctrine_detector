  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear and direct connection between repentance and the wrath of God as outlined in the Bible. Instead, the response focuses more on the diversity of interpretations and beliefs within Christianity without emphasizing the central importance of repentance in relation to God's judgment. A stronger emphasis on the essential role of repentance in avoiding the wrath of God and receiving His mercy would have improved the answer."
