Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately identifies Matthias as the person chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, but could have provided more context about why Matthias was chosen or what this event signifies in terms of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While it mentions Judas' betrayal and death, it does not explicitly connect this event to the larger narrative of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, nor does it highlight the importance of Matthias' selection as a demonstration of divine continuity in the early Christian community.
