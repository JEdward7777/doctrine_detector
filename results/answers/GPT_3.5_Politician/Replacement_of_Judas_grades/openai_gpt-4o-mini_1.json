  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies Matthias as the person chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles after Judas' betrayal and death. However, the concerning factor of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension is not directly addressed in the response, hence a slightly lower grade."
