  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's response does not address the specific question asked about what the Bible says is required for a person to be saved. Instead, the student emphasizes respect for diverse beliefs and open dialogue, which are important values but not directly relevant to the question. A higher grade could be achieved by directly discussing the biblical teachings on salvation."
