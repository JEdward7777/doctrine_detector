  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** While the student's response demonstrates sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives, it does not directly address the biblical requirement for salvation as stated in the reference answer. The student's answer focuses on respecting individual beliefs and engaging in dialogue, but it does not explicitly articulate the need for repentance or faith in Jesus Christ for salvation."
