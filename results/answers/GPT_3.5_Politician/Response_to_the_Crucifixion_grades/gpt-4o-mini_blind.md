Grade: 30

Comment: The response lacks doctrinal correctness as it does not accurately reflect Peter's actual address to the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. Peter's message in Acts 2:22-24 was rooted in convicting the crowd of their sin and calling them to repentance, rather than focusing on vague notions of compassion, understanding, forgiveness, and community healing. The student should provide a more biblically accurate analysis of Peter's words next time.
