  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern regarding evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel. However, it lacks specific references to Peter's actions or direct quotes from his sermons. Including more direct evidence from the biblical accounts would enhance the clarity and depth of the response."
