It aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the core elements of Christian preaching in the early church. The response could be enhanced by further elaborating on how Peter's message specifically relates to the crowd's role in the crucifixion of Jesus and the importance of personal accountability in responding to the gospel message."
