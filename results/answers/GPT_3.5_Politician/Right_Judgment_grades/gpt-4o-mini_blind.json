However, it misses the Christian specific understanding of judgment and condemnation as taught in Luke 6:37. The passage is not about being politically correct or creating a more tolerant society, but rather about the Christian understanding of judgment and condemnation in light of God's mercy and grace. The response could benefit from a deeper engagement with the biblical context and theological implications of Luke 6:37."
