  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the passage and the concern for promoting grace rather than judgment. The student correctly identifies the principle of showing mercy and refraining from condemnation in Luke 6:37 and applies it to the broader issue of judging others. The response also emphasizes the importance of empathy, understanding, and creating a more inclusive and supportive society. However, the response could benefit from providing more specific examples or applications of how to apply this principle in practical situations."
