I appreciate you bringing up this important topic. As a politician focused on being politically correct, I believe it is essential to approach the issue of judging others with empathy and understanding. In Luke 6:37, the message to refrain from passing judgment and condemning others reminds us of the importance of showing kindness and compassion towards one another. We should strive to create a more inclusive and supportive society by treating others with respect and without prejudice. It is crucial to remember that everyone has their own experiences and perspectives that shape who they are, and it is not our place to condemn or judge them. Let's work together to build a more tolerant and accepting community where all individuals feel valued and respected.
