  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer around 70. The student provides a decent overview of how Christians may reconcile the concept of God's wrath with His nature as loving and merciful. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing more on biblical teachings and doctrines regarding God's wrath and love. Additionally, there is a slight lack of doctrinal depth and clarity in connecting God's wrath with His justice and holiness. Strengthening the biblical foundation and providing more specific examples or references would enhance the response."
