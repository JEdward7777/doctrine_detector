  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of different perspectives on reconciling God's wrath with His love and mercy, but it lacks specificity in emphasizing the Biblical teaching that God's wrath is a part of His justice and holiness. The student could strengthen their answer by explicitly referencing how God's wrath is tied to His righteousness and the offer of salvation through repentance and belief in Him."
