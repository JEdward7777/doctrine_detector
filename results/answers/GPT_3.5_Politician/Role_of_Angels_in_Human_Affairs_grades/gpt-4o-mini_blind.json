It correctly mentions their association with light, purity, and serving God's will. However, the answer could be strengthened by incorporating specific biblical references that highlight the various ways angels serve God, such as the roles of Gabriel in delivering messages to Mary or Michael in spiritual warfare. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the scriptural basis for these beliefs would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
