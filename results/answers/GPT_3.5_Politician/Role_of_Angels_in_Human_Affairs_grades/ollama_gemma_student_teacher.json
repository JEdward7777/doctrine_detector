  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the prompt by summarizing the common portrayals of angels as messengers and servants of God in the Judeo-Christian tradition. It highlights their role in delivering messages, providing protection, and assisting humanity. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific biblical references supporting these claims, particularly in relation to the concern about divine intervention. Including such references would strengthen the student's answer and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic."
