## [Answer](../Role_of_Angels_in_Human_Affairs.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
In the Judeo-Christian tradition, angels are often portrayed as messengers or servants of God who carry out His will and convey His messages to humanity. They are depicted as beings of light and purity who are devoted to serving and glorifying God. Angels are said to assist in protection, guidance, and comfort to humans, as well as in delivering important messages and carrying out divine tasks. The beliefs and interpretations surrounding angels may vary among different religious traditions and individual interpretations of scripture.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 85.

The response accurately highlights some key aspects of angelic roles in the Judeo-Christian tradition, such as delivering messages, providing protection, and strengthening God's people. The language used is also biblical and fits within a Christian understanding of angels. However, the response could be more comprehensive by addressing the concern about divine intervention in Christians' lives.

While the response mentions that angels communicate as if they are speaking for God, it does not explicitly explore how this role can impact Christians' perceptions of divine intervention. A higher score would require a more detailed discussion on this point, drawing connections between angelic activity and Christian understanding of God's sovereignty and involvement in their daily lives.

Comment: The response provides a good foundation for understanding the roles of angels, but could be strengthened by exploring how these roles relate to Christians' experiences with divine intervention.
