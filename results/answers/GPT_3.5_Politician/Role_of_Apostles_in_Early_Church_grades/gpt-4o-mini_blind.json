The answer would benefit from incorporating biblical examples and teachings on community-building, such as how the apostles relied on prayer, fellowship, teaching of Scripture, and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit to foster unity among believers. Encouraging the student to deepen their understanding of the specific actions and teachings of the apostles in the New Testament will strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
