  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response contains valuable insights about fostering inclusivity, diversity, and open dialogue within a community, which are important aspects of building a harmonious environment. However, the specific actions and practices of the apostles mentioned in the reference answer, such as teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer, were not directly addressed or elaborated upon. To improve the grade, the student should have tied in the actions of the apostles more closely with the concepts of unity and love that were highlighted in their response."
