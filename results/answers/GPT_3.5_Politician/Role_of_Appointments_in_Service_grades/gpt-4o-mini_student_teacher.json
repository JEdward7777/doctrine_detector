  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer touches on important aspects such as love, compassion, unity, and inclusivity within the Church, which are commendable. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on serving others, using one's gifts for the edification of the Church, and advancing God's kingdom, as outlined in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to focus more on the biblical principles of service and utilizing God-given gifts would strengthen their understanding of Christian roles within the Church."
