However, the response lacks a direct connection to the Christian concept of sacrifice and atonement, which is an essential aspect to fully understand the depth of this biblical event within the Christian faith. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into how the sacrificial element of the Passover foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the atonement of sins would enhance the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
