It appropriately relates the event to themes of protection and deliverance. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect the concept of sacrifice and atonement within the Christian faith to the Passover event, emphasizing how this foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the atonement of sins."
