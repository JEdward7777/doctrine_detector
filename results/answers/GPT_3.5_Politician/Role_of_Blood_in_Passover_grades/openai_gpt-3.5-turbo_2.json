However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of sacrifice and atonement in Christianity to the symbolism of the Passover event. Emphasizing the parallel between the Passover lamb's blood and Jesus Christ's sacrificial atonement would have deepened the understanding from a Christian worldview perspective."
