However, it lacks a deeper exploration of the concept of sacrifice and atonement within the Christian faith, which is an essential aspect when discussing such topics from a Christian perspective. A more thorough examination of how the Passover foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the atonement of sins would have further enhanced the response."
