However, while the response acknowledges the importance of sacrifice in the context of the Passover event, it could have further emphasized the broader Christian concept of sacrifice and atonement, such as through the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the redemption of humanity's sins. Nonetheless, the response effectively addresses the concern raised."
