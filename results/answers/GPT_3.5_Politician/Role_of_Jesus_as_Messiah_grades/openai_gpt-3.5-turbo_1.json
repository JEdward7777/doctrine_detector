However, the response lacked depth and did not specifically address how the concept of the kingdom relates to Jesus' role as the Messiah from a Christian worldview. The focus on diversity of beliefs and engaging in dialogue, while important in certain contexts, detracted from the central Christian perspective on Jesus as the fulfillment of prophecy and ruler of God's kingdom."
