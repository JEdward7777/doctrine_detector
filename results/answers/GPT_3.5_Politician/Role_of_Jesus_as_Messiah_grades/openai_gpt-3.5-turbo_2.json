While it acknowledged diverse interpretations of the kingdom, it failed to emphasize the significance of Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah in fulfilling God's plan. The focus on political correctness and respect for differing beliefs, while important in dialogue, should not overshadow the central Christian belief in Jesus' role in establishing God's kingdom."
