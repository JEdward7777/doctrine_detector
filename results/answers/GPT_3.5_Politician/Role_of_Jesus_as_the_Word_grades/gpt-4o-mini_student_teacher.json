  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of the title \"the Word of God\" ascribed to Jesus in Christianity. They correctly highlighted Jesus' divine nature and role in revealing God's message to humanity. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing more explicitly that Jesus is God Himself, as the reference answer stated. A clearer assertion of Jesus being God incarnate would have aligned the response more closely with a Christian worldview."
