  "grade_comment": "The student's response provides a good overview of the role of Jesus in salvation according to the Christian faith, highlighting important aspects such as sacrifice, atonement, salvation, and teachings of love and grace. However, the response could benefit from including more specific references to biblical passages that directly address Jesus' role in salvation, such as John 3:16, Romans 5:8, and Ephesians 2:8-9. Incorporating these references would strengthen the answer and provide a more detailed and grounded explanation. \n\nGrade: 85\n\nComment: Good explanation overall, but could be improved by including specific Biblical references to support the points made."
