It aligns well with the concern by emphasizing the importance of clarifying Jesus' role for understanding redemption within Christianity. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to elaborate further on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and how it relates to atonement for sin, to provide a more comprehensive explanation."
