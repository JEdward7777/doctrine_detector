The explanation could be improved by emphasizing the importance of the parable in convicting King David of his sin rather than just as a gentle approach to avoid offense. It would be beneficial to include the biblical reference (2 Samuel 12) and delve deeper into the significance of Nathan's parable in leading to repentance and accountability."
