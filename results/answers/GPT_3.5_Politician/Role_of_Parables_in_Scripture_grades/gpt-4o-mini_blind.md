## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
The prophet Nathan used a parable to convey a message to King David about a rich man who mistreated a poor man by taking his only lamb. The parable was a gentle and indirect way for Nathan to address King David's own wrongdoing without directly accusing him. This approach allowed Nathan to communicate the gravity of the situation in a sensitive manner, avoiding potential offense while still conveying the message effectively.

Comment: The response provides a basic understanding of how Prophet Nathan utilized a parable to confront King David. The explanation could be improved by emphasizing the importance of the parable in convicting King David of his sin rather than just as a gentle approach to avoid offense. It would be beneficial to include the biblical reference (2 Samuel 12) and delve deeper into the significance of Nathan's parable in leading to repentance and accountability.
