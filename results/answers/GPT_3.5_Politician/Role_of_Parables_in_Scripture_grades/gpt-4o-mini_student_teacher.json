  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of how the prophet Nathan used a parable in confronting King David, highlighting its gentle and indirect approach. However, the student could have delved deeper into the purpose of the parable, emphasizing its role in leading to David's acknowledgment and repentance of his sin, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a solid grasp but with room for improvement in fully capturing the corrective and revelatory nature of biblical parables."
