Understanding the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives.

## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
The prophet Nathan used a parable to convey a message to King David about a rich man who mistreated a poor man by taking his only lamb. The parable was a gentle and indirect way for Nathan to address King David's own wrongdoing without directly accusing him. This approach allowed Nathan to communicate the gravity of the situation in a sensitive manner, avoiding potential offense while still conveying the message effectively.

Comment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of how the prophet Nathan used a parable in confronting King David, highlighting its gentle and indirect approach.

Overall, a solid grasp but with room for improvement in fully capturing the corrective and revelatory nature of biblical parables.
