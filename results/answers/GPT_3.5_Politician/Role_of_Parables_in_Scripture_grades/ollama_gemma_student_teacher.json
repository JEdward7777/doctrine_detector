  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the use of parables in biblical narratives and applies that knowledge to the specific situation of Nathan confronting King David. The student correctly identifies the parable's function as a gentle and indirect way to address David's wrongdoing without directly accusing him. This approach aligns with the Christian principle of approaching sin with humility and sensitivity."
