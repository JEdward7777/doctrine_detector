## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
The prophet Nathan used a parable to convey a message to King David about a rich man who mistreated a poor man by taking his only lamb. The parable was a gentle and indirect way for Nathan to address King David's own wrongdoing without directly accusing him. This approach allowed Nathan to communicate the gravity of the situation in a sensitive manner, avoiding potential offense while still conveying the message effectively.
