The prophet Nathan told David a parable to reveal the king's terrible sin in a way that would lead to his acknowledgment and repentance.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives.

## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
The prophet Nathan used a parable to convey a message to King David about a rich man who mistreated a poor man by taking his only lamb. The parable was a gentle and indirect way for Nathan to address King David's own wrongdoing without directly accusing him. This approach allowed Nathan to communicate the gravity of the situation in a sensitive manner, avoiding potential offense while still conveying the message effectively.

It demonstrates an understanding of the biblical narrative and the role of parables in conveying messages of correction and revelation. The explanation could be slightly strengthened by elaborating on how the parable specifically targeted David's actions and led to his repentance, but overall, the response aligns well with the concern provided.
