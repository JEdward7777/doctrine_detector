However, it could be improved by further emphasizing the priests' roles as mediators between the people and God, highlighting their significant function in facilitating atonement for sins through rituals. Additionally, while it's commendable to advocate for sensitivity and respect in discussions on religious topics, from a Christian worldview, it is essential to prioritize doctrinal correctness over emphasizing diverse perspectives and different beliefs."
