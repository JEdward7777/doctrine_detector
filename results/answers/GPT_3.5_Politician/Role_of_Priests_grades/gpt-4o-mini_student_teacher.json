  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of the responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, incorporating aspects of leading ceremonies, providing spiritual guidance, and acting as mediators between the people and God. However, the answer could have been more focused on the specific duties outlined in the reference answer, such as offering sacrifices, prayers, and teaching God's laws. Overall, a solid response with room for improvement in aligning the details more closely with the reference answer."
