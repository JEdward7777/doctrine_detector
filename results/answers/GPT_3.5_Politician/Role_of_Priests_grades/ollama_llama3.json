  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThe response provides some accurate information about the role of priests in the Old Testament, such as their involvement in offering sacrifices, providing spiritual guidance, and facilitating rituals of atonement for sins. However, it does not fully capture the scope of a priest's responsibilities, particularly in terms of teaching God's laws and pronouncing blessings.\n\nThe response also acknowledges the importance of recognizing diverse perspectives on this topic and approaching the discussion with sensitivity and respect, which is an important aspect of understanding the biblical role of priests.\n\nTo improve the grade, I would suggest providing more specific examples or illustrations from scripture to support the points made about priestly responsibilities. Additionally, exploring the ways in which the biblical role of priests has been carried out throughout Christian history and across different traditions could also enhance the response."
