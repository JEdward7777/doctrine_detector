  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 70. \n\nThe student correctly identifies some key aspects of a prophet's role according to the Bible, such as receiving messages from a divine source and delivering them to the people. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the primary role of a prophet, which is to speak the word of God and point people towards righteousness and repentance. Additionally, the mention of \"respecting the diversity of beliefs and interpretations\" may suggest a relativistic view of prophetic messages, which is not consistent with the Christian worldview that sees the Bible as the authoritative Word of God. \n\nOverall, while the student demonstrates some understanding of the role of a prophet, there are key doctrinal aspects missing that would elevate the grade."
