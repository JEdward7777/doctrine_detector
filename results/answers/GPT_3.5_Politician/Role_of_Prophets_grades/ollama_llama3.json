  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe response generally addresses the concern of understanding the biblical role of prophets and their messages, and it touches on some important aspects such as receiving messages from God and delivering them to people. However, it lacks specific Scriptural references or deeper explanations of the prophet's role, which would strengthen its connection to the biblical concept.\n\nAdditionally, while it acknowledges the importance of respecting diversity in beliefs and interpretations, this is not directly relevant to understanding the biblical role of prophets. The response could be improved by focusing more on the biblical teachings about prophecy rather than exploring broader theological or philosophical perspectives.\n\nOverall, a good effort, but with room for improvement!"
