However, it lacks depth in explaining the specific duties and functions performed by the Sadducees within the Temple. The mention of the literal interpretation of the Torah is relevant, but more emphasis could be placed on their roles in sacrificial practices, priestly duties, and their distinct beliefs such as the denial of the resurrection. Additionally, while sensitivity and inclusivity are important, it would be more appropriate to focus on doctrinal accuracy and historical context in discussing religious roles and responsibilities in this specific context."
