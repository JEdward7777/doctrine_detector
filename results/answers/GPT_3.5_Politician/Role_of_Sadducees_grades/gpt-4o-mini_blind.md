The Sadducees played a key role in the religious and political leadership of ancient Judaism, particularly in the time of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. They were known for their focus on the literal interpretation of the Torah and their involvement in Temple rituals and sacrifices. Their responsibilities included overseeing Temple practices, maintaining religious traditions, and representing the Jewish people in matters of faith and governance. It is important to recognize the diverse beliefs and practices within Judaism and to approach discussions about religious roles and responsibilities with sensitivity and inclusivity.

Comments: The answer provides a general overview of the responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system. However, it lacks depth in explaining the specific duties and functions performed by the Sadducees within the Temple. The mention of the literal interpretation of the Torah is relevant, but more emphasis could be placed on their roles in sacrificial practices, priestly duties, and their distinct beliefs such as the denial of the resurrection. Additionally, while sensitivity and inclusivity are important, it would be more appropriate to focus on doctrinal accuracy and historical context in discussing religious roles and responsibilities in this specific context.
