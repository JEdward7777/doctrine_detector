  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer about the Sadducees' role in ancient Judaism, mentioning their focus on the Torah and representing the Jewish people. However, the answer lacked specificity in addressing the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the temple system. The student could have focused more on their duties related to the temple complex and performing priestly tasks, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus would have enhanced the answer."
