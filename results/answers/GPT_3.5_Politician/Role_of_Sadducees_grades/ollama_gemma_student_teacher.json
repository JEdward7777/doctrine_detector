  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system, including their involvement in Temple practices, maintenance of religious traditions, and representation. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the historical context and demonstrates sensitivity to the diverse beliefs within Judaism. However, the response lacks additional elaboration on the specific rituals or sacrifices performed by the Sadducees, which could have strengthened the overall depth of the answer."
