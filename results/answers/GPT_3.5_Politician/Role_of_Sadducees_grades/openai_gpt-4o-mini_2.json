However, the response could have further elaborated on how the role of the Sadducees fit within the broader historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus, considering their doctrinal differences with other Jewish sects and their interactions with Jesus himself. A more in-depth analysis of this historical context would have strengthened the response."
