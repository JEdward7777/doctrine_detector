  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response adequately addresses the concern by providing a clear understanding of the significance of scribes in biblical history and the preservation of scripture. The language used is straightforward, and the main points are well-articulated. However, there is room for improvement in terms of depth and nuance. The original response provides some additional context about the scribes' responsibilities and their dedication to preserving the written word, which adds richness to the understanding of their role.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good grasp of the importance of scribes in biblical history, but could benefit from more detail and specific examples to further illustrate their significance."
