  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nThe student's response effectively demonstrates understanding of how Scripture is used in sharing the Gospel message by providing specific examples from the Bible such as 2 Timothy 3:16-17 and Acts 17:2-3. The student also highlights the importance and power of using Scripture in communication. However, the response could be improved by directly referencing specific individuals like Philip and Paul who used Scripture in evangelism, as indicated in the reference answer. By including more specific examples, the student's answer would align more closely with a Christian worldview perspective on the integration of Scripture in sharing the Gospel."
