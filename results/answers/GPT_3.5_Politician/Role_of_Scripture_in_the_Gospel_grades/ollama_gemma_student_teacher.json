  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer adequately addresses the concern by highlighting relevant passages from the Bible where Scripture was used to share the Gospel message. The student correctly points out the significance of the inspiration and usefulness of Scripture for teaching and persuasion. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview by emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in illuminating the Word of God and empowering believers to share the Gospel."
