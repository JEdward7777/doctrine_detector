  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 85. The student demonstrates an understanding of the importance of witnesses in the New Testament in recounting the life and resurrection of Jesus. They correctly highlight how the testimonies of these witnesses provide insights and legitimacy to Jesus' teachings and miracles. The mention of different perspectives in the Gospels also adds depth to the answer. However, to improve, the student could elaborate further on specific examples of how these witness accounts are critical in establishing the historical authenticity of Jesus' life and resurrection. Overall, a solid response with room for a bit more depth."
