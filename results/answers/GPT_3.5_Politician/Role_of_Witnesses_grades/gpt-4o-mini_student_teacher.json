  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student accurately addresses the crucial role witnesses play in recounting the life and resurrection of Jesus in the New Testament and acknowledges their testimonies as providing important insights, there is room for improvement in explicitly highlighting the personal aspect of the witnesses' accounts. To align more closely with the concern provided, the student could have emphasized the importance of personal testimony and the call for Christians to witness their faith and share personal experiences of God's work in their lives. Strengthening this connection would have made the response more robust in reflecting a Christian-specific worldview."
