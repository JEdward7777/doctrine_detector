  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the role of witnesses in the New Testament, specifically highlighting their importance in recounting Jesus' life and resurrection. The mention of eyewitness accounts and the establishment of historical context is also commendable.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by explicitly emphasizing the call for Christians to witness their faith and share personal experiences of God's work in their lives, as highlighted in the concern. While the original answer does touch on this theme, it is not as prominent as it could be.\n\nThe grade of 85 reflects a good effort to address the concern, but some improvement could be made to fully capture the significance of witnessing one's faith and sharing personal experiences with others."
