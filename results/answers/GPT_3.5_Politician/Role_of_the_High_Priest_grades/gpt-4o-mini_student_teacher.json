They accurately mentioned important duties such as leading significant ceremonies like the Day of Atonement and acting as an intermediary between the people and God. However, the student missed mentioning the key distinguishing responsibility of the high priest, which was the exclusive access to the most holy part of the tabernacle or temple to offer a special sacrifice once per year. This is a crucial detail in understanding the high priest's role in Israel's worship practices."
