The additional information on leading important ceremonies, serving as an intermediary between the people and God, and consulting with God through the Urim and Thummim enhances the understanding of the significance of the high priest's role in Israel's worship practices. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly connecting these aspects with the special sacrifice offered once a year in the most holy part of the tabernacle or temple."
