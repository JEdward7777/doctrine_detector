The high priest in ancient Israel held a significant and elevated role within the religious hierarchy. While all priests were responsible for conducting various rituals and offerings, the high priest had additional duties and privileges. These included leading the most important ceremonies, such as the annual Day of Atonement, and serving as the intermediary between the people and God. The high priest also had the authority to consult with God through the Urim and Thummim, sacred objects used for seeking divine guidance. It is important to note that discussions about religious roles and responsibilities should be approached with sensitivity and respect for the beliefs of different faith traditions.
