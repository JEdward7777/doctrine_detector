However, it lacks depth in explaining the significance of this belief from a Christian worldview. A stronger connection between the Holy Spirit's role in creation and the collaborative work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit could have been made to highlight the unique roles within the Trinity and how they work together in harmony."
