## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
In the biblical account, God instructed the Israelites to gather a double portion of manna the day before the Sabbath and to not gather any on the Sabbath itself. This was to ensure that they had enough food to sustain them on the day of rest.

90.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this answer as 90. The response accurately explains God's instructions to the Israelites regarding gathering manna in relation to the Sabbath. The student correctly states that they were to gather a double portion the day before the Sabbath and refrain from gathering on the Sabbath itself in order to have enough food for the day of rest. The only improvement would be to potentially include a brief reflection on the significance of this directive in terms of obedience and trust in God's provision.
