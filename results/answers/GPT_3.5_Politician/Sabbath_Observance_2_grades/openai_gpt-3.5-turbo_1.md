Comment: The response accurately conveys the biblical account of God instructing the Israelites to gather double the amount of manna before the Sabbath to sustain them on their day of rest. It demonstrates an understanding of the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands by highlighting the specific instruction regarding gathering food for that day.
