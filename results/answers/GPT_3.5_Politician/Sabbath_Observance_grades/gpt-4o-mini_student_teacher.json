  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the general principles of keeping the Sabbath holy, emphasizing rest, reflection, and worship. However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of directly connecting the concept to the commandments given to Moses. To improve, the student could have explicitly mentioned refraining from work and worshiping God as key elements in keeping the Sabbath holy according to the commandments. Overall, a good explanation with minor room for improvement."
