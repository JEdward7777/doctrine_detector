  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that demonstrates a good understanding of sacrificial love as demonstrated by Jesus. They emphasized the importance of selflessness and making personal sacrifices for the greater good, which aligns with Christian principles. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the connection between God's love and sacrificial love, as shown through Jesus' ultimate sacrifice on the cross. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of sacrificial love in personal relationships, drawing more explicitly from Christian teachings."
