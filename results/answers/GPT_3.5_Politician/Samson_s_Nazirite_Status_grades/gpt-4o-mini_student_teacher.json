The response lacked depth and did not directly connect Samson's strength to his adherence to the vow, missing a key aspect of the story. The student did acknowledge the importance of respecting different beliefs, which is commendable but not directly relevant to the question at hand. More analysis and integration of biblical themes would have been beneficial."
