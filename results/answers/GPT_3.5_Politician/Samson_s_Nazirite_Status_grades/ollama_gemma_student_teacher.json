  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. However, it could benefit from providing more specific examples or textual references from the Bible to support the claim. Additionally, the response lacks a deeper analysis of the implications of the Nazirite vow beyond its physical manifestations."
