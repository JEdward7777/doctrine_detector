  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the sanctification process for believers in Jesus, emphasizing spiritual growth, following Jesus's teachings, and embracing God's grace. However, the answer does not explicitly address the role of faith in the process of sanctification, which is a key concern in understanding sanctification from a Christian worldview. It would have been beneficial for the student to integrate the importance of faith in how believers are sanctified by God through their belief in Jesus."
