Comment: The student's response provides a general understanding of the term "sanctuary" in the context of the Bible as a sacred place for worship. However, the answer lacks depth in addressing the specific biblical significance of sanctuary, such as its connections to God's presence, protection, and forgiveness. Additionally, referencing the Old Testament tabernacle or the New Testament concept of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit would have enhanced the response.
