However, the student could improve their answer by emphasizing the divine aspect of sanctuaries in the Bible, highlighting that these are places set apart by God for His presence and protection. Additionally, incorporating the idea of sanctuaries as places of atonement and relationship with God would deepen the Biblical significance of the term."
