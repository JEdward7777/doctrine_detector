  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately defines the term \"sanctuary\" as a sacred place in the Bible, mentioning temples and designated areas for worship. However, it lacks specific reference to the concept of protection and safety, which is an important aspect of the term in the Biblical context."
