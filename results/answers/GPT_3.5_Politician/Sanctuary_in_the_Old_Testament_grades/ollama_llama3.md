I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately captures the essence of the sanctuary as a place where God's presence dwells among His people, providing a sense of safety and refuge. It also correctly identifies the sanctuary as a symbol of God's love and compassion for His people. The language used is clear and concise, making it easy to understand the significance of the sanctuary in biblical times.

However, the response could be improved by more explicitly highlighting the importance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people. While the response touches on this aspect, it could be further developed with more specific examples or Scripture references to support this point.

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the sanctuary's significance in biblical times, but could benefit from more explicit connection-making between the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and its role in providing safety and refuge for His people.
