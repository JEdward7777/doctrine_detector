  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 70. While the student provided some relevant Bible verses that speak to the concept of interceding for others, they did not include all the verses mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. By including additional verses like Isaiah 53:12 and Jeremiah 29:6-7 that specifically address intercessory prayer, the student could have strengthened their answer and demonstrated a deeper exploration of Scripture on the topic. Encouraging further engagement with additional relevant verses would have enhanced the student's response."
