Certainly. In the Bible, there are several verses that speak to the concept of interceding for others. Some of these include:

1. Romans 8:26 - "Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words."

2. 1 Timothy 2:1 - "First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people."

3. James 5:16 - "Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working."

4. Hebrews 7:25 - "Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them."

Interceding for others is seen as an act of compassion and empathy in many religious traditions, and these verses illustrate the importance and power of lifting others up in prayer or seeking blessings on their behalf.
