  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a strong foundation by referencing relevant verses that speak to the concept of intercession from the Bible. It effectively encourages believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession through the presentation of key verses. The inclusion of additional verses beyond those specified in the original response enhances the depth of understanding and enriches the perspective on interceding for others within a Christian worldview. Great effort in integrating biblical references to support the importance of prayer and intercession."
