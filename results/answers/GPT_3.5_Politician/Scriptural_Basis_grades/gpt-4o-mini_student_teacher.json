  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student completely disregarded the specified concern of connecting the theological concept of propitiation with biblical references for deeper understanding. Instead, they focused on promoting inclusivity and understanding among different faiths, which is not relevant to the question asked. The answer does not demonstrate an understanding of the specific Christian concept of propitiation and fails to engage with the requested verses from the Bible."
