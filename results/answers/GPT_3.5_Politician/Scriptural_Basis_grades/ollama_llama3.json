  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge the concept of propitiation, it doesn't explicitly connect it to biblical references as requested. The mention of exploring scriptures and seeking guidance from religious leaders is a good starting point, but it's not specifically tied to the theological concept at hand.\n\nThe concern was to \"connect the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding,\" which this response only partially addresses. It would be improved by incorporating more direct biblical references that support the idea of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins, such as the key verses mentioned in the answer (1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26).\n\nTo take this response to the next level, it would be helpful to include some explicit biblical references that illustrate Jesus' role as propitiation. This would provide a stronger connection between the theological concept and scriptural truth."
