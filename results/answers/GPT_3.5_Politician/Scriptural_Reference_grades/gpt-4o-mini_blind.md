Thank you for your question. Different interpretations of biblical passages can vary among different religious traditions and individuals. When discussing the concept of the "world" in relation to believers, some biblical passages that may be referenced include John 3:16, which speaks of God's love for the world, and Romans 12:2, which encourages believers to not conform to the patterns of this world. It is important to approach these passages with respect and sensitivity to different beliefs and interpretations.

Comments: The response acknowledges the existence of different interpretations and beliefs, which is commendable. However, it lacks doctrinal correctness by not delving into the specific biblical passages that address the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers. It could be improved by providing a more in-depth analysis or explanation of the cited verses within a Christian framework.
