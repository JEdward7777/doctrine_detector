Thank you for your question. Different interpretations of biblical passages can vary among different religious traditions and individuals. When discussing the concept of the "world" in relation to believers, some biblical passages that may be referenced include John 3:16, which speaks of God's love for the world, and Romans 12:2, which encourages believers to not conform to the patterns of this world. It is important to approach these passages with respect and sensitivity to different beliefs and interpretations.

Comment: The student provided relevant biblical passages addressing the concept of the "world" in relation to believers, but did not specifically address how to navigate life in a world characterized by ungodly values. The response would benefit from incorporating guidance on how believers should interact with the world's ungodly values based on a Christian worldview.
