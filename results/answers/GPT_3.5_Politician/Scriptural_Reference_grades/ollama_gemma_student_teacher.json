  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical concept of the \"world\" in relation to believers. They correctly identify relevant passages such as John 3:16 and Romans 12:2, and emphasize the need for respect and sensitivity towards different interpretations. However, the response could benefit from including more specific references to the concern about navigating life in a world characterized by ungodly values."
