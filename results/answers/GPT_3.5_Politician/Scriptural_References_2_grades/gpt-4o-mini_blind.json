  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer effectively identifies relevant biblical passages that support the concept of the day of judgment in Christianity. The reference to Matthew 25:31-46 and the book of Revelation demonstrates an understanding of key passages that speak to the final judgment. However, the response could be improved by elaborating further on the theological significance of the day of judgment in Christian doctrine. Overall, a strong and well-informed answer."
