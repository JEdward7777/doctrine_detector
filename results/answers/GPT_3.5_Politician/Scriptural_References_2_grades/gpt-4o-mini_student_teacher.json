  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned answer that correctly identified Matthew 25:31-46 and Revelation as biblical passages supporting the concept of the day of judgment. However, the student missed key passages specifically referenced by the teacher, which could have strengthened their answer. Additionally, the student could have included more in-depth analysis and explanation of the biblical passages mentioned. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but lacks specificity and depth in reference to the key passages."
