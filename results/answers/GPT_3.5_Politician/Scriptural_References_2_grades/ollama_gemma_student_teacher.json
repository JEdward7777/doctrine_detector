  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately identifies two relevant biblical passages that support the concept of the day of judgment. They also acknowledge the variations in interpretation and suggest consulting religious scholars for further insight. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from:\n\n* **Greater specificity:** The student could have listed the specific verses within the referenced passages that support the concept of judgment day.\n* **Inclusion of other relevant passages:** The student could have mentioned other biblical passages commonly referenced in Christian theology regarding judgment, such as the ones provided by the teacher as the key passages.\n\nOverall, the student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and provides relevant biblical references, but could be strengthened by including more specific verses and additional relevant passages."
