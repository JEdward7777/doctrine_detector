  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the concept of the day of judgment in Christianity and references key biblical passages to support this belief. It appropriately acknowledges the importance of consulting with religious scholars or leaders for further insight. The additional references provided in the initial answer are helpful in expanding the scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment. Overall, a solid response that effectively addresses the concern raised."
