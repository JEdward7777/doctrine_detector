## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
Thank you for your question. The concept of the day of judgment is an important belief in many religions, including Christianity. One commonly referenced biblical passage that supports this concept is from the book of Matthew in the New Testament, specifically Matthew 25:31-46, which describes the "final judgment" in which people are divided into the righteous and the unrighteous based on their actions towards others. Additionally, the book of Revelation in the New Testament also contains detailed descriptions of the judgment day and the consequences for individuals based on their deeds. It is important to note that interpretations of these passages may vary, and it is always best to consult with religious scholars or leaders for further insight.
