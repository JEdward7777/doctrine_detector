The focus on cultivating qualities like compassion, humility, and kindness is commendable. However, the response could have further emphasized the specific aspect of hypocrisy addressed in the passage, where Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their outward show of righteousness while neglecting justice and the love of God. Incorporating this deeper insight would have strengthened the answer."
