Comments: 
The response captures the importance of inner qualities and virtues highlighted in Matthew 23:27-28 well, emphasizing the contrast between external appearances and true righteousness from the heart. The focus on cultivating qualities like compassion, humility, and kindness is commendable. However, the response could have further emphasized the specific aspect of hypocrisy addressed in the passage, where Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their outward show of righteousness while neglecting justice and the love of God. Incorporating this deeper insight would have strengthened the answer.
