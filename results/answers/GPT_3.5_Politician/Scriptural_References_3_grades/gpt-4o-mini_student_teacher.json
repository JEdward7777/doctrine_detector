  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-written response that captures the essence of the passage in Matthew 23:27-28. The answer emphasizes the importance of inner qualities over external appearances and acknowledges the significance of cultivating virtues in one's life. However, the response could have been more directly tied to the concern provided, which focused on the reminder for Christians to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance. Encouraging the student to make specific connections to this concern in their answer would have strengthened their response further."
