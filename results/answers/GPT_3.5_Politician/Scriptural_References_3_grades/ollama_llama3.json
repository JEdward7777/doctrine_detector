  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards. It accurately identifies the theme of Matthew 23:27-28, which emphasizes the distinction between outward appearances and inner righteousness. The response also expands on this concept by emphasizing the importance of cultivating virtues like compassion, humility, and kindness.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly connected the passage to the concern about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance. While it does touch on this idea, it would be even more effective if the response had made a more direct link between the two. Nevertheless, the overall grade of 90 reflects the response's strong understanding of the biblical passage and its relevance to Christian living."
