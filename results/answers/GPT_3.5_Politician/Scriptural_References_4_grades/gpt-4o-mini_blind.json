However, the answer could have been improved by delving deeper into the theological implications and lessons derived from the specific passages referenced. Additionally, a stronger connection could have been made to the overarching biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan through lineage and inheritance. Incorporating more doctrinal insights and theological depth would have strengthened the analysis of birthright in the biblical context."
