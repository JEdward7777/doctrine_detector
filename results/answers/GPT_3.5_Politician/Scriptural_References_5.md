## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
In the New Testament, there are verses that suggest a shift in the understanding of Hades. One example is Luke 16:19-31, where Jesus tells the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. In this parable, the rich man is in torment in Hades, while Lazarus is comforted in Abraham's bosom. This story implies a distinction between the righteous and unrighteous in the afterlife.

Another example is Revelation 20:13-14, where Hades is described as being emptied and the dead being judged according to their deeds. This judgment scene suggests a separation between the righteous and unrighteous in Hades.
