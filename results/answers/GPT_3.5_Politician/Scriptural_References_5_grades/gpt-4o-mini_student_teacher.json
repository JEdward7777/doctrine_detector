  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from Luke 16 and Revelation 20 that show a shift in the understanding of Hades in the New Testament. However, the teacher's reference answer specifically highlights Luke 16:23 and Luke 23:43 as key verses that indicate this shift. The student's answer could have been improved by directly referencing these verses for a stronger connection to the concern provided."
