  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does provide some relevant scriptural evidence to support its claim about the shift in understanding of Hades, specifically referencing Luke 16:19-31 and Revelation 20:13-14. However, it does not fully capture the nuances of the original answer, which more accurately describes the distinction between righteous and unrighteous in Hades.\n\nThe concern is well-addressed, as the response provides relevant scriptural evidence that expands our knowledge of the nature of Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology. The only area for improvement is in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the shift in understanding of Hades, which the original answer does better.\n\nComment: Overall, this response provides some good insights into the biblical understanding of Hades, but could be improved by more fully engaging with the nuances of the text and providing a more accurate summary of the shift in understanding of Hades."
