  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of the concept of humility and exaltation in the context of Christian faith but lacks specificity in connecting the verses to illustrate these concepts. The student could improve by directly referencing the verses and explaining how they demonstrate the connection between humility and exaltation in the life of believers with more clarity and depth."
