  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful response that acknowledges the importance of living a blameless life in Christianity and includes relevant scripture references supporting this concept. The student could improve by incorporating more specific references, such as 1 Thessalonians 2:10 and 2 Peter 3:14, to align closer with the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the student's explanation on how these references can guide a Christian's life could be more detailed and focused on the specific virtues emphasized in the scripture. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated, but there is room for deeper analysis and integration of the provided references."
