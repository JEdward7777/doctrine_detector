  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning the Book of Genesis, which contains biblical references that can deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises. However, it does not specifically identify the reference in Genesis as \"Genesis 17:1\", which is the correct answer. This lack of precision reduces the grade.\n\nTo improve the response, the writer could have been more specific about the reference, such as mentioning the exact verse (e.g. \"In Genesis 17:1, we see God referred to as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham\").\n\nComment: While this response gets some credit for addressing the concern of knowing biblical references, it falls short by not being precise enough in its identification of the reference."
