The mention of self-reflection, repentance, and seeking spiritual guidance aligns well with the concern of recognizing the state of one's conscience for spiritual vigilance and integrity. However, the response could have further emphasized the role of sin, repentance, and renewal in restoring a seared conscience within a Christian worldview."
