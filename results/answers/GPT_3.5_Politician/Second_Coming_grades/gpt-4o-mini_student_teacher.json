  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that touches on the significance of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' in Christian theology, emphasizing hope, redemption, and the victory of good over evil for believers. The mention of seeking further guidance from religious leaders or scholars demonstrates humility and a recognition of the complexity of interpretations within Christianity. The answer could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting Jesus' return as the 'Son of Man' to believers' hope in His ultimate authority and the fulfillment of God's promises, as highlighted in the reference answer."
