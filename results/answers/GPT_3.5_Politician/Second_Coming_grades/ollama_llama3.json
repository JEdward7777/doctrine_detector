It also acknowledges the importance of consulting with religious leaders or scholars for a deeper understanding of specific denominational beliefs.\n\nHowever, while the response does touch on the implications of Jesus' second coming as the \"Son of Man\" for Christian hope and eschatology, it could be more explicit in its exploration of this concern. The given answer provides a good starting point, but the response could delve deeper into the scriptural basis for this promise, the expected characteristics of Christ's return (e.g., glory, judgment), and how this event relates to other key Christian doctrines (e.g., salvation, heaven). Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the broader theological context surrounding Jesus' second coming."
