It effectively addresses the concern by linking Jesus' second coming to Christian hope and eschatology. The only room for improvement would be to delve a bit deeper into the theological implications of Jesus returning as the 'Son of Man' in relation to eschatological beliefs. Overall, a well-articulated response from a Christian worldview perspective."
