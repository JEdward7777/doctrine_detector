It emphasizes the importance of remaining faithful and prepared for Christ's return, as well as acknowledging the variation in interpretations among Christian denominations. The only minor improvement could be to directly address the concern by explicitly connecting the implications of the second coming of Jesus as the 'Son of Man' to Christian hope and eschatology."
