  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings, highlighting the negative consequences and emphasizing the importance of humility and respect for others. However, the student could strengthen their answer by explicitly referencing relevant scriptures that warn against self-exaltation and pride, as indicated in the reference answer. Incorporating direct biblical references would elevate the response and align it more closely with a Christian worldview perspective."
