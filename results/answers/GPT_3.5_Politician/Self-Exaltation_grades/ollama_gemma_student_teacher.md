In many religious and moral teachings, including in certain interpretations of the Bible, there are warnings about the dangers of excessive self-exaltation. These teachings often caution individuals against arrogance, pride, and hubris, reminding them to practice humility and modesty in their actions and interactions with others.

Exalting oneself can lead to negative consequences such as alienating others, creating divisions, and fostering a sense of superiority or entitlement that can be harmful to relationships and communities. In some interpretations, it is seen as a form of selfishness that can distance individuals from spiritual growth and connection with a higher power or moral principles.

By acknowledging and respecting the worth and dignity of all individuals, and by practicing humility and gratitude, one can cultivate a greater sense of empathy, compassion, and understanding towards others. This can help foster a more harmonious and inclusive society where all individuals feel valued and respected, regardless of their status or achievements.
