  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer acknowledges the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context, which aligns with the given concern. However, it does not fully address the specific concern of separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles. The reference answer emphasizes the Pharisees' desire to maintain religious purity through separation, which is not explicitly addressed in the student's response."
