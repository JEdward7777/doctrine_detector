However, it is lacking in specificity and depth. It could benefit from including references to Scripture or examples of how these principles are put into action in a Christian ministry context. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of prayer, seeking God's guidance, and the central role of Jesus Christ in ministry would strengthen the answer."
