However, it lacks depth and fails to mention important theological aspects such as God's specific covenant with Noah, the purpose of the rainbow as a visible sign of this covenant, and the significance of God's promise in the narrative of salvation history. More theological depth and clarity in articulating the connection between the rainbow and God's covenant in Genesis would have improved the response."
