They also acknowledge the symbolic nature of the rainbow, highlighting its beauty and universality. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a deeper exploration of the covenant relationship between God and humanity, and how the rainbow serves as a reminder of that covenant. Additionally, the connection to hope, peace, and unity could be elaborated on in the context of the biblical narrative."
