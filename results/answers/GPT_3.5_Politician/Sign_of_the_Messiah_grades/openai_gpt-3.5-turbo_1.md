Comment: The response acknowledges the specific significance of the sign given to the shepherds in the Gospel of Luke, highlighting its connection to the arrival of the Messiah. However, there is a lack of emphasis on recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs, which is a crucial aspect from a Christian worldview. It is important to emphasize the deeper spiritual meanings and significance of these signs in relation to God's overall plan for salvation.
