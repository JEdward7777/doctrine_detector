However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of this specific sign in relation to prophecy fulfillment and God's divine plan, citing specific biblical references to strengthen the argument. It effectively maintains a Christian worldview perspective by emphasizing the importance of understanding the sacred event surrounding Jesus' birth."
