  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer touches on the importance of different interpretations and inclusivity in Bible translations, but it misses the central aspect of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect. The reference answer emphasizes how translating 'Shaddai' as a title highlights God's attributes and personal relationship, which is essential in understanding God's character in the Christian faith. The student's response lacks this crucial Christian worldview perspective, hence the lower grade."
