However, the response did not directly address the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect within the Christian faith. Connecting the explanation to how translating \"Shaddai\" as a title or name may impact Christians' understanding of God's character and relational aspect would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
