While the explanation of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title versus a name is relevant, it does not tie back explicitly to the importance of understanding God's attributes and relational nature within the Christian context. The response could benefit from a more direct connection to Christian theology and the significance of personal relationship with God in interpreting biblical terms."
