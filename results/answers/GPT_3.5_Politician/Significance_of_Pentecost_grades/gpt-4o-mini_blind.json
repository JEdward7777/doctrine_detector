It correctly highlights the descent of the Holy Spirit, the birth of the Christian church, and the empowerment of believers. The only area for improvement would be to add a bit more emphasis on the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as Joel 2:28-32, regarding the outpouring of the Spirit. This would deepen the understanding of the significance of Pentecost in the context of Biblical continuity."
