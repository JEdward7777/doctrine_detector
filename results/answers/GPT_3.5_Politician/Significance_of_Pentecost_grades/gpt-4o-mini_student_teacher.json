  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid explanation of the significance of the Day of Pentecost in the New Testament, highlighting how it marks the empowerment of believers through the descent of the Holy Spirit. The student appropriately connects this event to the beginning of the Christian church and the unity it brought among believers. However, the answer could have been improved by emphasizing more on the direct impact of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer."
