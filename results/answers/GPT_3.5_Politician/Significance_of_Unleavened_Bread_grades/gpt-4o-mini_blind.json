It is important for a Christian perspective to emphasize the specific Biblical context, such as the use of unleavened bread in the Passover meal as a symbol of purity and the haste with which the Israelites had to leave Egypt. Additionally, connecting the concept of unleavened bread to aspects like the removal of sin and the pursuit of holiness according to God's commandments would strengthen the answer from a Christian worldview."
