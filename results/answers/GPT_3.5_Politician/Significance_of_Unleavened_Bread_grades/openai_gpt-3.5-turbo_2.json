  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and well-explained interpretation of the spiritual significance of unleavened bread, linking it to the removal of sin in a person's life and the importance of honoring God. The additional information about humility, obedience, and spiritual purity adds depth to the understanding of the symbol. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique Christian perspective on unleavened bread and its significance in Christian teachings to receive a higher grade."
