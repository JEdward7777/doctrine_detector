However, the response lacks depth in connecting this governance structure to the specific historical context of Jesus' time and how it may have influenced political dynamics. Additionally, there is no mention of the biblical significance or implications of the term \"tetrarch\" in relation to Jesus' ministry. Further development and more specific references to historical and biblical contexts would enhance the overall response."
