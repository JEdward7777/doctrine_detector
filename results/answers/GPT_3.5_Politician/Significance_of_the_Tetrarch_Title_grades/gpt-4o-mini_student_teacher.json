  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the term \"tetrarch\" and its implications for governance during the time of Jesus. However, the answer lacks a direct application to the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry, as specified in the concern. Encouraging the student to make explicit connections to how the system of tetrarchy contributed to these tensions would strengthen the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
