The title "tetrarch" refers to a ruler of a division of a country or province. In the time of Jesus, the term "tetrarch" was used to describe a ruler of a quarter of a larger region or territory. This governance structure suggests a system of decentralized rule, with multiple tetrarchs governing different parts of a larger kingdom or empire. It reflects a complex political landscape with various levels of authority and potentially overlapping jurisdictions.
