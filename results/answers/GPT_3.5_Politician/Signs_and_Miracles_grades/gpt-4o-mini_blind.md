I believe that signs and miracles have been viewed by many as a way to demonstrate the power and truth of spiritual teachings and beliefs. These events are often seen as evidence of a higher power at work, and they have the potential to inspire and provide hope to those who witness them.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 40

Comments: The response lacks specific references to Christian teachings and scriptures regarding signs and miracles. It focuses more on a general perspective of spirituality and faith without grounding the discussion in the beliefs of Christianity. It is important for the student to connect their insights with the teachings of Jesus and the apostles to demonstrate a solid understanding of the question from a Christian worldview. Further development and incorporation of doctrinal elements are needed to improve the grade.
