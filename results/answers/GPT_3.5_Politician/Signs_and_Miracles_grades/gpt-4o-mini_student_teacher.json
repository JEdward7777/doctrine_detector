  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear connection between signs and miracles as proof of God's message, as seen in the acts of Jesus and the apostles. While the answer touches on the inspirational and hope-inspiring aspects of signs and miracles, it falls short in addressing the direct relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation as requested in the concern. The response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on how signs and miracles specifically authenticate the truth of God's message."
