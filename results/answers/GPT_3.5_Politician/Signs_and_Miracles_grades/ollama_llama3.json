  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60%\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant insights into the role of signs and miracles in demonstrating God's power, but it falls short in fully engaging with the concern about examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. While it acknowledges that signs and miracles can be inspiring and provide hope, the response does not explicitly address how these phenomena relate to God's message or the apostles' role in delivering it. Additionally, the response could benefit from more nuance and depth in exploring the complexities of spiritual experiences and interpretations. To improve, consider incorporating more biblical and theological perspectives on the relationship between signs, miracles, and faith."
