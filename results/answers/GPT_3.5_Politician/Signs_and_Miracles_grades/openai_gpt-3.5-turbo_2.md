Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of signs and miracles as validations of God's power and authority in delivering His message, which aligns with a Christian worldview. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of faith in interpreting signs and miracles as aspects of God's revelation. The concern was only partially addressed, hence the lower grade.
