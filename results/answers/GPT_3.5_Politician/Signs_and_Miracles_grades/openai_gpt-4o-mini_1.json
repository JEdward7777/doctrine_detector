However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern by not delving deeper into the significance of signs and miracles as a means of God's revelation to humanity. A more explicit exploration of how signs and miracles serve as manifestations of God's presence and communication with His creation would strengthen the response in light of the specified concern."
