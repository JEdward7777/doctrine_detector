Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the connection between signs and miracles and God's power and authority, aligning well with a Christian worldview. However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern by not delving deeper into the significance of signs and miracles as a means of God's revelation to humanity. A more explicit exploration of how signs and miracles serve as manifestations of God's presence and communication with His creation would strengthen the response in light of the specified concern.
