  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response shows a basic understanding of the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation by acknowledging that signs and miracles serve as validations of God's power and authority. However, the response does not fully elaborate on how these signs and miracles reveal God's message through Jesus and the apostles. It lacks depth in exploring the significance of these supernatural events within the Christian worldview. The concern raised about examining this relationship is only partially addressed, leading to a somewhat limited analysis."
