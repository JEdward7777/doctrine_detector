  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the term \"Son of God\" in relation to Jesus and His relationship with God the Father. The explanation accurately conveys the belief in Jesus' divinity and unique relationship with God. However, the student could have further emphasized the inseparable nature of Jesus as fully God, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a good grasp of the concept with room for a slight improvement."
