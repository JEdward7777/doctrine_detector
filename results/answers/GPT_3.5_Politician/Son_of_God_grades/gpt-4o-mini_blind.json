  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The student did not address the question from a Christian worldview perspective. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness by failing to explain the fundamental difference between the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus and the term 'sons of God' used for believers in Christian theology. The response also lacked depth and specificity, missing the opportunity to provide a clear and accurate explanation within a Christian framework."
