Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response completely misses the Christian-specific distinction between the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus and the term 'sons of God' used for believers. The answer lacks theological depth and fails to address the concern of clarity in theological discussions. It is important for the student to understand and accurately communicate the specific theological concepts within a Christian worldview.
