  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly and clearly explains the distinction between the title 'Son of God' as referring to Jesus and 'sons of God' as believers in Christ. This aligns well with Christian theology and helps avoid confusion in theological discussions. The only minor concern is that the response could have emphasized the importance of this distinction a bit more strongly to reflect the significance of theological accuracy in Christian beliefs."
