  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly clarifies the distinction between the title 'Son of God' for Jesus and 'sons of God' for believers in Christ, aligning with Christian teachings. This clarity is important in theological discussions to avoid confusion. The response could have provided a bit more depth or explanation to further enrich the understanding of these terms, but overall it effectively addresses the concern given."
