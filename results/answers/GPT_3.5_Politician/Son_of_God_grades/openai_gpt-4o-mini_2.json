  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response correctly highlights the distinction between 'Son of God' as referring to Jesus and 'sons of God' as all believers in Christ. This clarity is crucial in theological discussions to avoid confusion. However, the original response takes a more relativistic approach, which may not fully align with a Christian worldview that upholds the unique divinity of Jesus as the Son of God. The importance of upholding this fundamental Christian belief could have been emphasized more clearly in the response."
