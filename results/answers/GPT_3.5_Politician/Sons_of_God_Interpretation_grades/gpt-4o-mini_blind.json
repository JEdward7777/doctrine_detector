  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student provided a decent overview of some interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, mentioning angels or righteous individuals. However, the answer lacks depth in exploring the doctrinal implications and historical context of these interpretations within Christian theology. The final paragraph, while emphasizing respect for diverse beliefs, misses an opportunity to delve deeper into the significance of the interpretations within Christianity."
