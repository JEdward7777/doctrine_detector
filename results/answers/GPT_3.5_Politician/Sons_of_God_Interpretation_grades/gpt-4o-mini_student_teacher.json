  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student correctly outlines different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, their answer lacks depth and specific engagement with Biblical scholarship on the topic. The student also includes a somewhat irrelevant comment on respecting diverse beliefs as a politician, which does not directly relate to the topic at hand or provide a Christian worldview perspective on biblical interpretation.\n\nThe student's response could be improved by delving deeper into each interpretation presented and discussing how each aligns (or does not align) with Christian theological principles. Additionally, providing scriptural references or quotes from theologians could strengthen the answer."
