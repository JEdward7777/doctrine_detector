However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to emphasize that in traditional Christian belief, all believers are considered saints through their faith in Jesus Christ. The term \"saint\" in the New Testament refers to all believers set apart for God's purposes, rather than a title bestowed only through the official process of canonization. Additionally, the answer could have highlighted the role of Christ's sacrifice and grace in sanctifying believers, rather than solely focusing on their own actions and virtues. Overall, while the response conveys some key aspects of the topic, it lacks depth in presenting the broader theological understanding of saintliness in Christianity."
