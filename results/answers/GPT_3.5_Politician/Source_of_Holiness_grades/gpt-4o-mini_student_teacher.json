  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer accurately describes the process of canonization in some Christian denominations, but it overlooks the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine of becoming saints. The concern specified the importance of clarifying the source of holiness, which the student's answer failed to address adequately. The student's response should have emphasized that believers become saints not through their own deeds, but through their faith in Jesus Christ, who makes them holy."
