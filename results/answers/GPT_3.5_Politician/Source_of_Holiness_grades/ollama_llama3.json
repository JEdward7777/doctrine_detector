The response does not explicitly state that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus' saving work, which is a crucial aspect of Christian doctrine. However, it does provide some accurate information about the concept of saints and their role as role models for faithful Christians.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest adding more explicit language emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of holiness, such as \"Believers are not declared saints because of their own actions or deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy and sets them apart as His people.\" This would better address the concern of clarifying the source of holiness and reinforce the central role of faith in Jesus in Christian doctrine."
