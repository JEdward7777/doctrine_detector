## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
In the Christian faith, believers are recognized as saints through a process called canonization. This process varies among different Christian denominations, but it generally involves a rigorous evaluation of the individual's life, actions, and dedication to their faith. Once officially declared a saint, believers are honored for their exemplary piety, virtue, and devotion to God. It is important to note that saints are seen as role models for the faithful and are venerated for their spiritual guidance and intercession.
