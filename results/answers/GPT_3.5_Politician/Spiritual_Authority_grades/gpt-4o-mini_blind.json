  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 70.\n\nThe answer provides a basic explanation of how spiritual authorities differ from earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. It correctly highlights the different roles and responsibilities of spiritual and earthly authorities. However, the answer lacks depth and does not delve into specific Biblical references or teachings regarding this topic. Additionally, it could have emphasized more on the importance of submitting to spiritual authorities in matters of faith and obeying earthly authorities unless they contradict God's commands. Overall, while the answer is generally accurate, it could benefit from more specific doctrinal references."
