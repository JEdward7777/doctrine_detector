  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response provides a general understanding of spiritual and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching, emphasizing the importance of both types of authorities. However, the student's answer lacks a clear distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities as presented in the reference answer. The Biblical basis for distinguishing spiritual authorities as entities that exert power over those who do not submit to God's authority is missing. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the implications of recognizing this distinction in a Christian's life."
