  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities within a Christian worldview, referencing Ephesians 6:12 appropriately. The emphasis on submitting to God's authority and recognizing the different spheres of influence for spiritual and worldly authorities aligns well with Christian teachings. The response could be strengthened by offering more biblical references to support the discussion further. Overall, a thoughtful and well-rounded analysis."
