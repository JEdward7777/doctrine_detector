  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response an 85.\n\nThe response effectively recognizes the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities as delineated in Ephesians 6:12, highlighting the different realms of influence and control they hold. The explanation provided aligns well with a Christian worldview, acknowledging the unique roles and purposes of both types of authorities in a believer's life.\n\nHowever, the response could have been further strengthened by delving deeper into how Christians are called to interact with and respond to these authorities, particularly in terms of obedience to God's ultimate authority and discerning how to navigate the often complex relationships between spiritual and worldly powers. Providing additional scriptural references or examples to support the discussion would have enhanced the depth and clarity of the response."
