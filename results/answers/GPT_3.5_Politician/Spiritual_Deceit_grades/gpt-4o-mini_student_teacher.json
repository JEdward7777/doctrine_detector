  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer fails to address the specific concern raised in the question. Instead of focusing on the role of demons in the deception of idolatry from a Christian perspective, the response emphasizes tolerance and inclusivity of diverse beliefs. The Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of discerning spiritual deceit and staying true to the truth of God's sovereignty, which is not adequately reflected in the student's answer."
