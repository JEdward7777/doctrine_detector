  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The answer provides a general overview of spiritual gifts in the Bible, acknowledging their purpose of building up the church and serving others. The mention of varying interpretations and beliefs is valid, but the answer lacks depth in explaining the specific spiritual gifts mentioned in the Bible and how they function within the body of Christ. To improve, the student should delve deeper into the different types of spiritual gifts described in the Bible and how they are meant to operate in the Christian community according to biblical teachings."
