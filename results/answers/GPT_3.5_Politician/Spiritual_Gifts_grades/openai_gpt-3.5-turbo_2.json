The important aspect of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit is acknowledged. The response could have delved deeper into the scriptural basis for spiritual gifts and how they are meant to function within the body of Christ, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern from a Christian perspective."
