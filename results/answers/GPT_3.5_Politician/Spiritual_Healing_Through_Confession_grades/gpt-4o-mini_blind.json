However, it lacks explicit reference to the specific spiritual healing aspect as mentioned in James 5:16. A stronger connection to the biblical text and the power of confession for spiritual healing would have strengthened the response. Consider incorporating more direct scriptural references and theological depth to enhance the answer."
