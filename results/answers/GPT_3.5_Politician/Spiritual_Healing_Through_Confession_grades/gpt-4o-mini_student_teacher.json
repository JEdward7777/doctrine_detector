  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained answer that aligns with the importance of community in spiritual growth. They effectively highlighted the benefits of confessing sins to one another in promoting accountability, vulnerability, and a sense of community among believers. The only improvement could be to explicitly tie in the aspect of spiritual healing as mentioned in James 5:16, to fully align with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
