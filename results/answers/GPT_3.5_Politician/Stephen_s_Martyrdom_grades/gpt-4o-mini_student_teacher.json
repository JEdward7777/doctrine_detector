  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 40.\n\nThe student's answer shows a basic understanding of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church and briefly mentions the challenges faced by early believers. However, the response lacks depth and fails to directly address the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. Additionally, the inclusion of a reference to being a politician is irrelevant and detracts from the focus on the Christian worldview.\n\nOverall, the student's answer demonstrates some understanding but falls short in providing a thorough examination of the religious significance and implications of Stephen's stoning in line with a Christian worldview."
