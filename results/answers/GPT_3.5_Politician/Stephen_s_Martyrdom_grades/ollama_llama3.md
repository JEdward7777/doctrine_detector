Grade: 80

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church, highlighting its impact as one of the first instances of martyrdom for the faith. However, it does not fully capture the depth and nuance of the concern about reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution.

The response mentions the challenges faced by early believers, including persecution and opposition, but does not explicitly explore the personal costs and sacrifices that Stephen made as a result. Additionally, while it emphasizes the significance of Stephen's stoning, it could have delved deeper into the biblical narrative to illustrate the faithfulness and commitment displayed by Stephen in the face of death.

To improve, the response could have incorporated more specific examples from Scripture and explored the personal costs and sacrifices that Stephen made as a result of his martyrdom.
