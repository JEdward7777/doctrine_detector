  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively reflects on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution by highlighting the significance of Stephen's martyrdom in the early Christian church. It acknowledges the commitment of early Christians to stand firm in their beliefs despite the threat of death. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly connecting these concepts to the respondent's role as a politician and how they should approach discussions of religious events with sensitivity and understanding in light of the martyrdom of Stephen."
