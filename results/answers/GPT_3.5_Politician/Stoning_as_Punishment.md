## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
The Bible does address the practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery in various passages, particularly in the Old Testament. However, it is important to consider these texts within their historical and cultural context. As a politician, I believe it is crucial to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives and beliefs.

In terms of God's justice and mercy, it is essential to note that the Bible also teaches about forgiveness, redemption, and the value of human life. While stoning was indeed a common form of punishment in ancient times, many scholars and theologians interpret these passages through the lens of compassion and the importance of seeking reconciliation and restoration. 

As a politician, I believe in upholding the dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. It is important to engage in respectful dialogue and understanding when discussing sensitive topics such as this, and to approach the interpretation of religious texts with humility and a commitment to inclusivity.
