  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response lacks doctrinal correctness in addressing the practice of stoning for adultery as outlined in the Bible. The emphasis placed on sensitivity and inclusivity detracts from the foundational principles of God's justice and mercy as revealed in Scripture. There is a need for a more biblically grounded approach that aligns with Christian doctrine and teachings on sin, judgment, and grace. The response falls short in addressing the theological implications of stoning and fails to convey a faithful understanding of God's holiness and His standards for righteousness."
