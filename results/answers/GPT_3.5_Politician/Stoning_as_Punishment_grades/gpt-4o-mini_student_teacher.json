  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear alignment with the Christian perspective on God's justice and mercy as outlined in the reference answer. They do not directly address the concept of God's justice and mercy in relation to stoning for adultery, nor do they provide a solid theological analysis based on biblical teachings. The response focuses more on political correctness and inclusivity rather than examining the biblical principles at hand. There is a need for a stronger integration of Christian worldview perspectives in their discussion."
