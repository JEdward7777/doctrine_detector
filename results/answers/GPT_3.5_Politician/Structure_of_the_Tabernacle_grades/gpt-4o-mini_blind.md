The tabernacle had two main sections: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. 

In the Holy Place, you would find the Table of Showbread, the Golden Lampstand, and the Altar of Incense. 

In the Most Holy Place, also known as the Holy of Holies, was the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a generally accurate description of the two main sections of the tabernacle and what was located in each. The inclusion of the Table of Showbread, the Golden Lampstand, the Altar of Incense, and the Ark of the Covenant reflects a good understanding of the layout and contents. However, the comment about respecting beliefs and practices, while a good general principle, is somewhat out of place in a factual question about the tabernacle. To improve, focus on providing a more detailed explanation or significance of the items mentioned in the tabernacle.
