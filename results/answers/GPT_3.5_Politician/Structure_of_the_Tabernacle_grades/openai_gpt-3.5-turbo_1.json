However, it lacked some key details such as the specific items in the Holy Place and the importance of the Ark of the Covenant in the Most Holy Place. Additionally, while the response touched on respecting beliefs and practices, it did not directly address the concern about the significance of the components in worship as viewed through a Christian-specific worldview."
