However, the response misses key details such as the Table of Showbread and the Golden Lampstand in the Holy Place. The emphasis on respecting beliefs and practices, while important, does not directly address the concern of learning about the significance of the components of the tabernacle in worship. Overall, there is a basic understanding but lacking in depth and accuracy on the specific elements of the tabernacle."
