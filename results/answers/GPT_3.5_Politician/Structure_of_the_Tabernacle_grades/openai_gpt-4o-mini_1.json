  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the two main sections of the tabernacle and mentions the significance of the altar for burning incense and the Ark of the Covenant. However, it does not provide as much detail about the specific components of the tabernacle in worship as the given answer. The response acknowledges the importance of respecting beliefs and practices, but it does not fully address the concern about learning the significance of the components in worship."
