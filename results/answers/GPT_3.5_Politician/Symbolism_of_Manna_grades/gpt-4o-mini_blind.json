It would benefit from referencing the biblical account in Exodus where manna was provided to the Israelites in the wilderness, highlighting the themes of trust, obedience, and reliance on God's sustenance. Additionally, connecting manna to Jesus as the true bread of life in the New Testament would enhance the theological understanding of God's provision in Christian belief."
