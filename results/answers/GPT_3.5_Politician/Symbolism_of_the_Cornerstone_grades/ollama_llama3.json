  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 92.\n\nThe response accurately captures the essence of the cornerstone metaphor, highlighting Jesus as the foundation of Christian faith and the source of unity among believers. The writer effectively explains how the metaphor illustrates Jesus' importance in the lives of His followers, emphasizing His role as both the source of strength and the reference point for their faith.\n\nWhile the response does not explicitly address the concern about aligning one's life with Christ's teachings and example, it indirectly touches on this theme by showing how the cornerstone metaphor can help believers understand Jesus' significance in their lives. The writer's focus on the unity and cohesion brought by Jesus among His followers also implicitly underscores the importance of following Christ's example.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into practical applications of the cornerstone metaphor, such as how it can guide believers in making daily decisions or living out their faith in a way that honors God. Nevertheless, the response provides a solid foundation (pun intended!) for understanding the cornerstone metaphor and its significance in Christian theology."
