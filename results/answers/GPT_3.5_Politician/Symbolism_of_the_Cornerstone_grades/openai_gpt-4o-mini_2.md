The metaphor of the cornerstone is often used in Christian theology to represent the importance and centrality of Jesus in the faith. Just as a cornerstone provides stability and support for a building, Jesus is seen as the foundation upon which the beliefs and practices of Christianity are built. This metaphor highlights the idea that Jesus is the central figure around which all other aspects of the faith revolve.

In terms of the relationship between Jesus and His followers, the metaphor of the cornerstone emphasizes the idea that Jesus is the unifying force that brings believers together. Like stones being fitted together to form a building, followers of Jesus are brought together in a shared belief and purpose. This metaphor suggests that Jesus is not only the foundation of the faith but also the source of unity and cohesion among His followers.

Overall, the metaphor of the cornerstone serves to underscore the significance of Jesus in the Christian faith and the role that He plays in bringing His followers together in a shared community of faith.
