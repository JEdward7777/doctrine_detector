The mention of innocence, purity, and submission in relation to the lamb is good. However, the answer lacks depth in explaining the theological significance of the sacrificial system in the Old Testament and how it points to the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ. The answer could be improved by including references to passages such as Isaiah 53 and Hebrews 9-10 to provide a more comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation. Additionally, emphasizing the necessity of blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins as foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus would enhance the response."
