  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the symbolism of the lamb in sacrifices and its connection to atonement, highlighting key concepts such as innocence and seeking reconciliation. However, the response could be improved by delving deeper into the specific Christian perspective on atonement and the significance of the lamb in foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins. Additionally, the importance of the student's sensitivity towards differing beliefs is noted, but the response could benefit from a more direct application of a Christian worldview in discussing the topic."
