It also acknowledges the importance of this symbolism in the Christian understanding of atonement and redemption through Christ. The only minor improvement could be a more explicit connection to how the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, often referred to as the \"Lamb of God,\" fulfills and transcends the symbolism of sacrificial lambs in the Old Testament."
