Comment: The response comprehensively addresses the concern by highlighting the figurative aspect of the term "synagogue" to encompass the community of worshippers who gather there. It acknowledges the communal significance of gathering for worship and supports this perspective through an inclusive understanding of the term beyond just the physical building. The response could be strengthened by explicitly tying this inclusive interpretation to the Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of unity and fellowship among believers in worshipping together as a community.
