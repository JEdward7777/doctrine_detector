It correctly states the Old Testament view of the temple as a physical manifestation of God's presence and the shift in the New Testament to believers being the temple of God. However, it could be strengthened by elaborating more on the significance and implications of believers being the temple of God in the New Testament, such as the implications for personal holiness and the responsibility that comes with being a dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Additionally, a reference to specific biblical passages supporting these views would have added depth to the response."
