## [Answer](../Temple_as_God_s_Dwelling.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
In the Old Testament, the temple is seen as the physical manifestation of God's presence among the people of Israel. It is the sacred space where worship and sacrifices are conducted, and where the divine presence is believed to reside. In the New Testament, the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is reinterpreted to emphasize the idea that believers themselves are now the temple of God, with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. This shift reflects a more personal and intimate relationship with God, accessible to all believers regardless of physical location.

Comment: The answer provides a generally accurate explanation of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments. It correctly states the Old Testament view of the temple as a physical manifestation of God's presence and the shift in the New Testament to believers being the temple of God. However, it could be strengthened by elaborating more on the significance and implications of believers being the temple of God in the New Testament, such as the implications for personal holiness and the responsibility that comes with being a dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Additionally, a reference to specific biblical passages supporting these views would have added depth to the response.
