## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a clear and concise description of Jesus' resistance to temptation, highlighting his strength and wisdom in the face of Satan's attempts. It also effectively uses Jesus as an example for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil, which aligns with the concern.

While the response does not explicitly state that Jesus' actions demonstrate obedience and commitment to God, it is implicit in the description of his resistance to temptation. Additionally, the response could be strengthened by providing more specific biblical references or examples from Scripture to support its claims.

Overall, however, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation and its relevance to Christian discipleship.
