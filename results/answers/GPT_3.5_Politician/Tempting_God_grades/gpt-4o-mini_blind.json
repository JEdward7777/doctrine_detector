However, it could be improved by specifically citing relevant biblical passages (such as Matthew 4:7 or Deuteronomy 6:16) that address the consequences of tempting God. Additionally, the last sentence, while well-intentioned, slightly deviates from a Christian-specific worldview by suggesting a need for sensitivity towards different religious beliefs and interpretations."
