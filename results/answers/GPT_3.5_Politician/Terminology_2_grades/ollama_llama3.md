Comment: The response addresses the concern of understanding various terms used within Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper, but it only mentions two terms ("communion" and "Last Supper") whereas the original response lists four terms ("Lord's Supper", "Holy Communion", "Eucharist", and "Mass"). While the response does attempt to acknowledge that there are different names for this sacred practice, its limited scope prevents it from fully addressing the concern.
