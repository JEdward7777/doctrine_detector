  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies two common terms used in Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper (communion and Last Supper), demonstrating a fundamental understanding of the topic. However, the response falls short of a perfect score as it does not mention other important terms like Eucharist, Mass, and Sacrament of the Altar, which are also commonly used within Christian communities to refer to this sacred practice. It shows a partial understanding but lacks comprehensive coverage of the various terms used within Christianity."
