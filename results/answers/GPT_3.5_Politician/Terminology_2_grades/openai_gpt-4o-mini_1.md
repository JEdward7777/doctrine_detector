Comment: The response accurately identifies some terms used within Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper, specifically 'communion' and 'Last Supper'. However, it does not fully address the concern as it does not include other significant terms like Holy Communion, Eucharist, Mass, and the Sacrament of the Altar. Overall, a good understanding is shown but could have been more comprehensive.
