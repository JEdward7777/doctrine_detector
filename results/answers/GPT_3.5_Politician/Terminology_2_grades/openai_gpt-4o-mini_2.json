However, the response could be improved by mentioning additional terms commonly used in Christian communities such as Holy Communion, Eucharist, Mass, and Sacrament of the Altar. Understanding the full range of terms associated with this sacred practice would have demonstrated a more comprehensive knowledge in this context."
