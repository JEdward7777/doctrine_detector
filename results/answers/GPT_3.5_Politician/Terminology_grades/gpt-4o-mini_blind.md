I would grade this response a 75.

The student has provided some alternative terms that can be used to describe a deacon, which demonstrates a basic understanding of the question. The terms suggested are generally appropriate and accurate in describing the role of a deacon in Christian ministry. However, there could have been a more comprehensive and varied list provided to reflect a deeper understanding of the diverse aspects of a deacon's responsibilities. Additionally, terms such as "church official" may be too broad and not specific enough to capture the unique role of a deacon within the church hierarchy. Overall, while the response is acceptable, there is room for improvement in providing a more nuanced and specific list of alternative terms.
