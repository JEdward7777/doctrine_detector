  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Based on the given concern and the provided answer, I would grade the student's response as 80.\n\nWhile the student provided some relevant alternative terms for a deacon that align with service roles within the church, the reference answer from the teacher offers a more concise and comprehensive list of alternative terms specifically focused on service within the context of the church. The student's answer is good, but it could have been improved by including terms like \"church worker\" and \"church servant\" that were mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept but could have provided a more complete set of alternative terms."
