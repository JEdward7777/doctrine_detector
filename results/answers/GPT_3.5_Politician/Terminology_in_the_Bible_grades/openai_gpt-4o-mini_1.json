The mention of different cultural or historical connotations and individual preferences demonstrates an awareness of the complexity of these terms. Connecting the importance of recognizing these terms to understanding Biblical texts shows a solid grasp of the concern provided. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful response from a Christian worldview perspective."
