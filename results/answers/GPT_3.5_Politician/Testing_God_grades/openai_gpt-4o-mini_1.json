  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately explains why it is considered wrong to put God to the test by highlighting the importance of acknowledging God as almighty and holy. It aligns well with the concern provided, emphasizing the significance of maintaining a proper relationship with God. The only potential improvement could be providing a bit more depth or explanation behind the concept of putting God to the test in relation to this principle. Overall, a solid response from a Christian worldview perspective."
