  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer a 85.\n\nThe answer provides a clear distinction between testing and temptation in a biblical context, highlighting the purposes and implications of each concept accurately. The response acknowledges the importance of sensitivity and respect towards diverse beliefs within the religious community. However, the answer could be enhanced by incorporating more specific biblical references to support the explanation of testing and temptation. Additionally, it would be beneficial to emphasize the role of God's sovereignty in allowing testing for the believer's spiritual growth. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could benefit from additional depth and textual support. Well done!"
