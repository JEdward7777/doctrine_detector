  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 75.\n\nWhile the student's response does highlight the distinction between testing and temptation in a biblical context, there is a lack of emphasis on the fact that God does not tempt individuals, as mentioned in the reference answer by the teacher. The student could have further strengthened their answer by clearly stating that temptation is not initiated by God but by external influences, leading individuals away from their faith. Additionally, the student's answer could have been more explicit in aligning with a Christian-specific worldview by emphasizing the importance of resisting temptation with the help of God's grace. Overall, the student provided a solid response but could have been more precise in conveying the nuances of testing and temptation in line with a biblical perspective."
