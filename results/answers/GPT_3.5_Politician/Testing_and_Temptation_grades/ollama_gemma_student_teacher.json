  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts of testing and temptation. It clearly articulates the differences between the two concepts and provides relevant examples from Scripture. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the spiritual implications of testing and temptation, particularly in the context of Christian faith."
