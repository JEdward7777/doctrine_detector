  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of James 2:13 and accurately linked the principle of showing mercy to receiving mercy from God. Their answer effectively conveys the importance of mercy in Christian conduct and its implications for spiritual life. However, there was a slight deviation in wording and the explanation could have been more concise and direct, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
