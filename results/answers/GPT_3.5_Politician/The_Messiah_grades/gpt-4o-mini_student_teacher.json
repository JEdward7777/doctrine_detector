  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a clear explanation of the terms 'Jesus' and 'Christ' and correctly noted the significance of 'Christ' as the title meaning 'anointed one' or 'messiah.' However, the student could have elaborated more on the implications of Jesus being identified as the Messiah and the importance of this title in Christian belief."
