  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer acknowledges the diversity of beliefs and practices surrounding prayer, which is commendable. However, the response falls short in directly addressing the difference between praying to the true God and talking to a false god. The reference answer clearly defines praying as communication with God, emphasizing the spiritual communion and true relationship with the divine, which the student's answer lacks in articulating. Encouraging respectful dialogue is important, but it is equally crucial to uphold the biblical truth about prayer and the nature of God."
