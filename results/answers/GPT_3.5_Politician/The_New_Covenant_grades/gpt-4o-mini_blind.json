  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the answer acknowledges the importance of sensitivity and respect for different perspectives, it lacks doctrinal correctness by not delving into the biblical foundation of God writing His law on the people's hearts in the New Covenant. To improve the grade, the student should include references to key passages like Jeremiah 31:33 and Hebrews 8:10, explaining how this concept reflects God's transformative work in believers through the Holy Spirit. Additionally, emphasizing the centrality of Jesus Christ in mediating this New Covenant would enhance the doctrinal accuracy of the response."
