The reference to personal knowledge of God and intrinsic motivation to follow His will aligns well with Christian beliefs. It appropriately addresses the concern by highlighting the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response that demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian perspective."
