It correctly highlights the concept of sharing in Christ's glory, experiencing eternal joy, and the hope of resurrection. However, the answer could be enriched by including references to key Bible verses such as Romans 8:17 and 2 Corinthians 3:18 to support the explanation. Additionally, emphasizing the transformation of believers to be conformed to the image of Christ in glory would strengthen the theological depth of the response. Remember to incorporate more scriptural support and theological depth in future answers to enhance clarity and accuracy."
