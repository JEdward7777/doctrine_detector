The answer could benefit from a more focused exploration of how the concept of cleansing specifically relates to sin and redemption in the New Testament, drawing from specific biblical passages or theological teachings to support the explanation. Additionally, the response could have emphasized the centrality of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection in providing cleansing from sin and bringing about redemption.
