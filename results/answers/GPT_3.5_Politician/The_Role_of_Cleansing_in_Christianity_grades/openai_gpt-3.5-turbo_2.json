The inclusion of the importance of understanding the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings is relevant and adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of Christ's redemptive work in bridging the Old Testament practices with the New Testament teachings for a more comprehensive understanding."
