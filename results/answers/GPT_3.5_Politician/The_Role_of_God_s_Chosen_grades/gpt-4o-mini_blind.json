The response could have delved deeper into the biblical foundation of how God chose individuals like Moses and David, highlighting specific criteria or characteristics rather than staying vague. Additionally, the response could have emphasized the sovereignty of God in His selection process, showcasing the significance of divine calling and purpose in the lives of these chosen figures. Encouraging a more robust exploration of biblical doctrines and theological principles would strengthen the answer."
