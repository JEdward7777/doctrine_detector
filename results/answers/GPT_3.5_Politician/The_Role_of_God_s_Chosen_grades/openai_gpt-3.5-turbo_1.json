It adheres to the concern by emphasizing the divine purpose and plans behind God's selection of leaders. The response could further strengthen its Christian perspective by explicitly connecting the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders to the broader implications for the Christian community, such as the call to follow and submit to God's chosen leaders as part of His divine plan for His followers."
