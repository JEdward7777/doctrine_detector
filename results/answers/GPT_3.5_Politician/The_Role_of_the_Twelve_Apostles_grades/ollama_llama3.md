The twelve apostles held a special place among Jesus' disciples because they were chosen by him to carry forth his teachings and spread the message of love and compassion to the world. They played a crucial role in establishing the early Christian church and were instrumental in sharing the gospel with diverse communities. It is important to recognize the individual contributions of each apostle while also acknowledging the collective impact they had on shaping the growth and development of Christianity.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 85.

The response accurately acknowledges the significance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, highlighting their role in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Christian church. It also demonstrates an understanding of the apostles' individual contributions while acknowledging their collective impact on shaping Christianity. The language is clear and concise, making it easy to follow and understand.

However, the response could be improved by more explicitly referencing Scripture or drawing connections between the apostles' roles and Jesus' teachings. For example, a mention of passages like Acts 1:21-22 or John 15:16 would strengthen the response's biblical foundation.

The only concern is that the response does not explicitly state that the apostles were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and continue His teachings after His ascension, which is the key point emphasized in the provided answer. While this is implied through the mention of "continuing His teachings," a more direct connection would further solidify the response's biblical accuracy.

Overall, I believe the response effectively conveys the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry while demonstrating a good understanding of their roles and contributions.
