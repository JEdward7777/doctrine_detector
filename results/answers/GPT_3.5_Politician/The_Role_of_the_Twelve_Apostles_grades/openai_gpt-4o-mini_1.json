The response could be strengthened by elaborating more on how the apostles contributed to the establishment of the early Christian church and the spread of the gospel, along with emphasizing the significance of their individual roles. Nonetheless, the core message addresses the concern adequately and demonstrates an understanding of the apostles' crucial role in Christianity."
