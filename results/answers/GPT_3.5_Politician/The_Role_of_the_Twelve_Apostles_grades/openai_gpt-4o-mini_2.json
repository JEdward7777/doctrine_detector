It aligns well with the concern provided, affirming the importance of the apostles in Christian theology. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps expand on how the apostles specifically carried out Jesus' teachings and the impact they had on early Christianity, to provide a more detailed exploration of their significance."
