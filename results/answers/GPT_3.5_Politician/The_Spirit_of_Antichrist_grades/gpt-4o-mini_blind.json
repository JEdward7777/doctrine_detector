It is important to acknowledge differing interpretations but it is equally crucial to uphold the truth of Scripture and the specific teachings regarding the spirit of antichrist. Encouraging understanding and empathy is commendable, but the response could be improved by grounding the explanation more firmly in biblical truths."
