Comment: The response correctly identifies the reason for the Israelites transitioning away from using the tabernacle as the building of the temple in Jerusalem by Solomon. However, it does not elaborate on the significance of this transition from a Christian worldview perspective. A higher grade could be achieved by discussing the theological implications and the fulfillment of God's promises through the building of the temple.
