  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the key transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple when the temple was built in Jerusalem by Solomon. The concern regarding understanding this transition is fully addressed in the response. However, a higher grade could be achieved by providing a bit more depth or explanation on how this transition impacted the religious beliefs and practices of the Israelites from a Christian worldview perspective."
