Grade: 65

Comment: While the student's answer emphasizes respect for local Bible translations and cultural sensitivity, it lacks a critical analysis from a Christian worldview. It is crucial to highlight that 'El Shaddai' is a specific Hebrew name for God found in the Bible, and translations should strive for accuracy in conveying the meaning and significance of this name rather than merely providing corresponding terms in different languages. The student should have emphasized the importance of preserving the theological and doctrinal implications of the term 'El Shaddai' in various translations.
