  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 65.\n\nWhile the student acknowledges the importance of respecting local Bible translations and cultural diversity, their answer lacks specificity in addressing the concern of accurately representing God's name across different languages. The teacher's reference answer provides a clear and accurate translation of 'El Shaddai,' which the student should have incorporated into their response. Additionally, the student could have elaborated on the significance of maintaining the meaning and reverence of God's name in different linguistic contexts.\n\nOverall, the student's answer demonstrates a general awareness of cultural sensitivity but falls short in providing a precise and detailed recommendation for translating 'El Shaddai' in different languages."
