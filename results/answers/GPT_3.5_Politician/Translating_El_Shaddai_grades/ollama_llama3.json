  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern to ensure accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages. It specifically recommends respecting local Bible translations and using corresponding terms in different languages, which shows an appreciation for cultural diversity and linguistic nuances. However, it could be improved by directly referencing the given answer and explaining why 'El Shaddai' can be translated as 'God Almighty' or kept as 'Shaddai', rather than simply stating it. Nevertheless, the response effectively acknowledges the importance of accuracy in translation while also honoring diverse cultural beliefs."
