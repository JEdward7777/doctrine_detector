The suggestion to translate 'El Shaddai' as 'God Almighty' or 'Shaddai' depending on the language's phonetics shows consideration for maintaining the reverence and meaning behind the name. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of God's name and the importance of upholding its sanctity when translating it into different languages."
