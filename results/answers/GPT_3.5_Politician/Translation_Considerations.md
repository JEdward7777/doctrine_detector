I believe it is important to be mindful of the sensitivity and significance of individual terms in religious texts, including the terms 'Zion' and 'Daughter' in the context of biblical translations. These terms hold deep theological and cultural significance for many individuals and communities, and changing them could potentially alter the understanding and interpretation of the text for those who hold them in high regard.
