  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70. \n\nThe student's response shows a good understanding of the importance of retaining specific terms like 'Zion' and 'Daughter' in biblical translations due to their theological and cultural significance. The student emphasizes sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs, which aligns with a Christian worldview of valuing different traditions. However, the answer could have been stronger by explicitly mentioning the rich figurative meanings associated with these terms and how they help maintain a connection to Biblical heritage and teachings, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. By incorporating these aspects more explicitly, the student's response would have further demonstrated a thorough understanding of the importance of these terms in biblical translations."
