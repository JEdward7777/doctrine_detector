These terms hold deep theological and cultural significance for many individuals and communities, and changing them could potentially alter the understanding and interpretation of the text for those who hold them in high regard. It is essential to approach such matters with sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs and traditions in order to promote unity and understanding among all individuals.
