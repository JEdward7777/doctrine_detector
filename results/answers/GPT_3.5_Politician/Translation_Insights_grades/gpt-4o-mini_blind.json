However, from a Christian standpoint, the emphasis should be on doctrinal accuracy and theological significance rather than political correctness. The suggested translations should focus on capturing the biblical and theological essence of the term while respecting the sacred nature of humanity and the uniqueness of Jesus as the Son of God. The answer lacks depth in exploring the theological implications of these translations within Christian doctrine."
