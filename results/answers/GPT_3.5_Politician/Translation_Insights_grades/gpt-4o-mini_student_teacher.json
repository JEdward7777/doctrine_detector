  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 70. While the student made an effort to provide alternative translations for the phrase 'image of God' when applied to humans and Jesus, their focus on using politically correct and inclusive language detracts from the theological significance of the translations. The student fails to address the theological depth of the concept and instead places more emphasis on inclusivity in language, which may dilute the core teachings of Christianity. The teacher's reference answer provides a more accurate and theological understanding of the translations needed to grasp the biblical teachings, which the student's answer lacks."
