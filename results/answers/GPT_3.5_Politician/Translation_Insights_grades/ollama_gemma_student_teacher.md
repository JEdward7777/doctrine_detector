## Question [Translation Insights](../../../questions/Translation_Insights.md)
What are some suggested translations for the phrase 'image of God' when applied to humans and Jesus, and why might these translations be significant?

## Correct Answer
For humans, suggested translations include 'created to be like him' or 'with characteristics like his own'; for Jesus, 'exact likeness of God' or 'same essence as God'. These translations underscore the nature of humanity's relation to God and Christ's divine nature.

## Stated Concern
This question encourages exploration of the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings.

## [Answer](../Translation_Insights.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
When referring to humans as the 'image of God,' some suggested translations that may be more politically correct and inclusive include "divine likeness" or "reflection of the divine." These translations highlight the sacredness and spiritual nature of humanity without implying that only certain individuals possess this quality.

When referring to Jesus as the 'image of God,' alternative translations could include "embodiment of the divine" or "God's reflection in human form." These translations emphasize the unique understanding of Jesus as a figure who embodies the qualities and essence of the divine without diminishing the significance of other religious or spiritual beliefs.

Using more inclusive and politically correct language in these translations is important because it recognizes and respects diverse viewpoints and beliefs. It promotes dialogue and understanding among people of various faith traditions and backgrounds, avoiding language that may be exclusive or divisive.
