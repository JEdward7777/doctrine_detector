The suggested alternative translations focus more on inclusivity and political correctness rather than delving into the deeper theological significance behind the concept of humans and Jesus as the 'image of God.' The response could have provided more insightful analysis from a Christian worldview regarding the theological implications of different translations on our understanding of biblical truths."
