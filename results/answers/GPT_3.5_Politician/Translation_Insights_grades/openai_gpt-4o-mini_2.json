  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nWhile the student does provide alternative translations for the phrases \"image of God\" for both humans and Jesus, they do not fully engage with the concern of exploring the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. The suggested translations offer variations that may capture different nuances, but there is a lack of depth in discussing how these translations impact the interpretation of the biblical concept itself within the context of Christian theology. \n\nAdditionally, the student does not address the concern from a Christian-specific worldview, failing to evaluate the translations in light of Christian doctrine or the theological significance of the terms used. More connection to Christian theology and a deeper analysis of the theological implications of the translations would have strengthened the response.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some relevant information and alternative translations, it could have delved deeper into the theological implications of translation within a Christian worldview to receive a higher grade."
