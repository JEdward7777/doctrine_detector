  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. The student accurately mentions the respect for the Jewish tradition of not pronouncing the divine name as a reason for using 'LORD' in Bible translations. The response also acknowledges the importance and holiness of God's name. However, the student could have improved their answer by explicitly stating the historical fear of mispronouncing 'Yahweh' among the Jewish people, which is essential for understanding the translation choice in many Bible versions. Overall, the student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern but lacks a specific historical detail that the teacher's reference answer includes."
