## [Answer](../Translation_Practices.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
Many Bible translations use 'LORD' in place of 'Yahweh' out of respect for the Jewish tradition of not pronouncing the divine name. By using 'LORD,' translators are attempting to honor this tradition while still conveying the importance and holiness of the name of God. It is a way to be sensitive to different beliefs and practices within the religious community.
