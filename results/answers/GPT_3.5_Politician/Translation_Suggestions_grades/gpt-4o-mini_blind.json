  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 80. The student provided two alternative translations for the phrase \"to be zealous\" that are close in meaning to the biblical concept of zeal. The first alternative, \"to be fervent in spirit,\" captures the idea of deep passion and intensity, which aligns with the biblical understanding of zeal. The second alternative, \"to have great enthusiasm or passion for something,\" also conveys the essence of zeal in a broader, more accessible way. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical meaning of zeal and provides reasonable alternative translations."
