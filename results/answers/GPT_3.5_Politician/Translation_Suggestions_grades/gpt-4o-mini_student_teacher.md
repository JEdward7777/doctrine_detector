Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided two alternative translations that capture the essence of being zealous from a biblical standpoint. However, the student missed out on some key translations that convey the intensity and commitment expected in the Christian faith, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. It would have been stronger if the student had included translations such as "be strongly diligent," "make an intense effort," or "be eager in determination" to fully reflect the depth of meaning in being zealous within a Christian worldview.
