  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 80. While the student accurately provides alternative translations for 'covenant faithfulness' that align with the concept of faithfulness and commitment, they could have added more explicitly theological terms like 'divine loyalty' or 'faithful covenant-keeping' that capture the specific depth and significance of the concept within a Christian worldview. Strengthening the theological depth of the alternatives would have made the answer more robust and aligned with a Christian perspective on covenants."
