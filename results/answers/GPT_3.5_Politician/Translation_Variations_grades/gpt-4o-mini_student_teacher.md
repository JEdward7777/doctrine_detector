Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided reasonable alternative translations for 'covenant faithfulness' that capture the essence of loyalty and commitment, but missed the emphasis on love present in the reference answer from a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to consider how love and faithfulness are intertwined in the biblical concept of covenant faithfulness would deepen their understanding even further.
