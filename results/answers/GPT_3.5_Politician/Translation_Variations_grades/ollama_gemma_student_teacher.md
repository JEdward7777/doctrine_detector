**Comment:** The student's answer correctly suggests alternative translations that capture the essence of 'covenant faithfulness', but it lacks the depth and theological richness of the teacher's response. While the student's suggestions are accurate, they fail to explore the covenantal relationship between God and humanity as explicitly as the teacher's answer.
