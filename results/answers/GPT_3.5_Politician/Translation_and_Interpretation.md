## Answer given by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
When referring to God, the term "Lord" is often used as a title of respect and reverence in many religious contexts. It reflects a belief in a higher power or deity that holds authority and power over creation.

On the other hand, when used in reference to ordinary people, the term "Lord" can sometimes carry connotations of elitism or hierarchy, as it historically has been used to address those of higher social or noble status. In modern contexts, using "Lord" to refer to an everyday person may come across as outdated or overly formal, depending on the cultural and social context.

Therefore, it is important to be mindful of the implications and potential sensitivities associated with using the term "Lord" in different contexts to ensure respectful and inclusive communication.
