  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a generally accurate explanation of how the term \"Lord\" differs in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people. They correctly highlight the reverence and respect associated with using \"Lord\" for God, as well as the potential connotations of elitism or hierarchy when referring to ordinary individuals. However, the response could be strengthened by including more specific biblical references or theological insights related to the significance of calling God \"Lord.\" Additionally, emphasizing the unique divine attributes and authority tied to the title of \"Lord\" in Christian theology would enhance the overall depth of the response."
