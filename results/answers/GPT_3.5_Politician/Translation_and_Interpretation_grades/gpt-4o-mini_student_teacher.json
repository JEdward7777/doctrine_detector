  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer gives a general overview of how the term \"Lord\" can be understood in different contexts, but it does not specifically address the translation differences between contexts referring to God versus ordinary people as requested in the question. Additionally, the student's answer lacks specificity in addressing the concern of how proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impact the understanding of scripture and the nature of God. More focus on the specific translation nuances and their importance within a Christian worldview would have improved the answer."
