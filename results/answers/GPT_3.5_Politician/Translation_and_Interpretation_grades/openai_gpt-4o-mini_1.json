The explanation highlights the importance of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms, which indeed have a significant impact on understanding scripture and shaping our perception of the nature of God. The response could further emphasize the divine connotations of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God within a Christian worldview, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern."
