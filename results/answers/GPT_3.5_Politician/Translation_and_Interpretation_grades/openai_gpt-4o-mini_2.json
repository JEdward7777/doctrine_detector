  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately explains the distinction between the term \"Lord\" when referring to God and when used in reference to ordinary individuals. It also acknowledges the importance of being mindful of the implications of using such language in different contexts. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of using \"Lord\" as a title of respect and reverence specifically within a Christian worldview and the implications of mistranslations or misinterpretations on understanding scripture and the nature of God."
