They correctly highlighted that it refers to something that is morally offensive or detestable according to religious teachings. However, emphasizing the biblical perspective on sin and God's holiness as key factors in defining abomination would have enhanced the answer. Additionally, mentioning that abominations often involve a violation of God's commandments could have further strengthened the student's response."
