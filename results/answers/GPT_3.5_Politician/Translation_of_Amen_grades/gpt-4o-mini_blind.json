  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 75. \n\nThe answer provided a good list of potential translations of 'truly' used by Jesus in phrases like 'truly I tell you'. The student also mentioned the importance of considering context and audience for clarity and respect for different interpretations which shows an understanding of the complexity of translation in Biblical studies. However, the answer could be improved by incorporating a deeper analysis of the theological significance behind Jesus using phrases like 'truly I tell you' in the biblical context. Adding a theological perspective would have made the answer more comprehensive and reflective of a Christian worldview."
