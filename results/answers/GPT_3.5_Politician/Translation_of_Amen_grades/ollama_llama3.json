  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides some potential translations for the phrase \"truly I tell you\" and highlights the importance of considering context and audience when selecting a translation. This shows an understanding of the concern about accurate biblical translation and interpretation.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the original answer (\"Yes, I tell you sincerely\" or \"What I am telling you is true.\") and could be strengthened by providing more explicit connections between the potential translations and the importance of accuracy in biblical interpretation. Additionally, while the response mentions considering context and audience, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how this applies to biblical translation and interpretation.\n\nOverall, the response shows some understanding of the concern about accurate biblical translation and interpretation, but could be improved by providing more explicit connections and a more detailed discussion of the importance of accuracy."
