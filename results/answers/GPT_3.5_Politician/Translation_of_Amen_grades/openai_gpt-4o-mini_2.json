The suggested translations, \"Yes, I tell you sincerely\" and \"What I am telling you is true,\" convey the sense of 'truly' effectively while maintaining the integrity of the original meaning. The consideration of context and audience is evident in the explanation, showing respect for different interpretations within the Christian worldview. Great job!"
