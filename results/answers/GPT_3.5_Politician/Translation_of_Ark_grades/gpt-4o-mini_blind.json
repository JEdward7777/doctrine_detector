However, it lacks depth and does not engage with the nuances of the term \"ark\" in specific biblical instances, such as the Ark of the Covenant, Noah's Ark, or the Ark in the story of Moses. To improve, the response could include specific examples and delve into the theological significance of these different translations within the biblical narratives."
