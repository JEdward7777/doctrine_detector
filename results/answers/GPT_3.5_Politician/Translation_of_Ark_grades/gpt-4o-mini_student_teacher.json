  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70.\n\nWhile the student did provide some information about the varying translations of the term \"ark\" in the Bible, they did not delve into the different contexts in which the term is used and its significance in those contexts. The student also did not mention specific examples like Noah's ark, the ark of the covenant, or the ark in which baby Moses was placed, which are important to understanding the term's significance. Additionally, the student's answer lacks depth and analysis, and it could have been improved by providing more specific examples and explanations of how the term \"ark\" is used in different biblical contexts."
