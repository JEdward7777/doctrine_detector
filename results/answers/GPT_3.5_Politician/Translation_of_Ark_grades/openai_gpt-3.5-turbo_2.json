It also acknowledges the importance of accurate translation for proper interpretation of scripture. However, to further align with a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to emphasize the significance and symbolism of these \"arks\" in biblical narratives, linking them to broader themes of faith, salvation, and God's providence."
