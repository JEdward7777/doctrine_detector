The term "begotten" may have different meanings and connotations in various religious or spiritual contexts.

It also emphasizes the universal themes of renewal and transformation in spiritual rebirth. However, the response could have better addressed the concern by directly relating the concept of being spiritually "begotten" to the believer's relationship with Christ and the implications of this spiritual rebirth within a Christian worldview.
