  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the answer provides some suggestions for translations of the term 'church' that reflect its meaning, it lacks a Christian-specific worldview. In a Christian context, the term 'church' holds a specific theological significance as the body of believers or the congregation of Christ. The answer falls short by not acknowledging this specific understanding and instead opts for more general and secular terms. To improve, the student should include translations that capture the essence of the ecclesiology and theological significance of the term 'church' in Christianity."
