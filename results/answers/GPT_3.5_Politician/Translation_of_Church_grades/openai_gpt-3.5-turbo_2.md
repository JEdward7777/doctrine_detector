Comment: While the response provides acceptable translations that encompass the inclusive nature of the church, it lacks specificity and depth in addressing the concern about accurately representing the church's inclusive nature. It could have elaborated on how each suggested translation captures the essence of the church as a unified body of believers from diverse backgrounds, emphasizing the importance of inclusion in the Christian faith.
