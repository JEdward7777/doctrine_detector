However, it could benefit from explicitly highlighting the universal and unifying nature of the church as the body of Christ composed of diverse believers, underlining the theological foundation of inclusivity in Christ. This additional depth would further strengthen the representation of the church's inclusive nature in translations from a Christian worldview perspective."
