The mention of considering grammatical structure in the target language is valuable. However, the concern here is that cultural and religious sensitivities should also be taken into account, especially in conveying the full weight of the term 'Lord Yahweh' in different contexts. While accuracy in translation is essential, sensitivity to the audience's understanding and beliefs should also be a priority to effectively communicate the divine presence and significance of Yahweh."
