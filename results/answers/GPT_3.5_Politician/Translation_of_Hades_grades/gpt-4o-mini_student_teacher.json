  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer falls short in accurately representing the biblical meanings of 'Hades' and 'Sheol' for greater understanding among believers. The student's focus on being politically correct and inclusive overlooks the importance of maintaining the integrity of biblical concepts. The translation options suggested lack specificity and depth in conveying the rich theological nuances of these terms. A more focused and accurate approach is needed to ensure a faithful representation of the biblical meanings."
