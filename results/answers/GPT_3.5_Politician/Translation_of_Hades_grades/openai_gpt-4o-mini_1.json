  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response suggests appropriate translation options for 'Hades' and 'Sheol' that are inclusive and respectful of diverse religious perspectives in society. However, it fails to prioritize accurate biblical representation in translations, which is essential for greater understanding among believers. The translation suggestions should have emphasized the biblical meanings and connotations of 'Hades' and 'Sheol', aligning more closely with the concern provided."
