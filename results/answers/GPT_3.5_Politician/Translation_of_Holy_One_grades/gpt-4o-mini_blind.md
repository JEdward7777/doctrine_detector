Comment: The response touches on the importance of cultural sensitivity and respect for religious beliefs, which is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview, the term "Holy One" has specific theological significance referring to the holiness of God. It would have been beneficial for the student to emphasize the importance of accurately conveying this theological concept in different languages while respecting cultural nuances. Encouragement to consult with experts in both linguistics and theology could strengthen the answer from a Christian perspective.
