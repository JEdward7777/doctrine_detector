However, it falls short of fully embracing this concern by suggesting that a direct translation is not always necessary. While retaining the meaning of holiness is important, the response could have further emphasized the need to consult with native speakers and religious scholars to ensure an accurate and respectful translation.\n\nIn particular, the original answer's suggestion that \"God\" or \"the Set Apart One\" are suitable translations may be too narrow, as it implies a specific theological understanding that may not be universally accepted. A more comprehensive approach would involve considering multiple perspectives and cultural contexts to produce a translation that is both accurate and respectful."
