It correctly emphasizes the significance of retaining the concept of holiness, as it often implies a reference to God or the Set Apart One. This aligns well with the concern of ensuring accurate representation of the term while respecting its theological connotations. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly mentioning the relevance of consulting with native speakers and religious scholars to achieve a culturally sensitive and accurate translation."
