It correctly emphasizes conveying the concept of holiness with sensitivity to religious beliefs, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to maintaining accuracy and respect in cross-cultural translations. The only minor critique is that it could have further highlighted the significance of consulting not only with native speakers and scholars but also with a Christian theological perspective to ensure the faithful representation of the term."
