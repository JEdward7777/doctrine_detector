  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe student accurately provides a range of suggested translations for the term \"predestined\" which align with theological concepts such as determinism and divine sovereignty. The context note provided at the end also demonstrates good awareness of the importance of understanding the specific context in which the term is used. However, the response could be further strengthened by explaining how each translation aligns with the doctrinal principles of predestination in a Christian worldview. Providing scriptural references or theological explanations could enhance the depth of the response."
