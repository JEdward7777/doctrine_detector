The suggested translations align well with a Christian worldview and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of predestination, considering different connotations that may be present in various translations. The concern about accurately understanding biblical translations related to predestination is effectively addressed in the response. Great job in providing a thoughtful and informative list of translations that contribute to a deeper comprehension of the term."
