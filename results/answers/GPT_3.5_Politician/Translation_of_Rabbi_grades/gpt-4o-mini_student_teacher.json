  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer addresses important considerations such as understanding the religious and cultural context, consulting with native speakers, and being aware of potential cultural sensitivities. However, the answer falls short in directly addressing the concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The response lacks a clear connection to ensuring that the translation of \"Rabbi\" does not diminish Jesus' divine status or importance as more than just a schoolteacher. The answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning the need to convey the honor and reverence associated with Jesus' teachings in a Christian theological context."
