  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response does address some important considerations for translating the term \"Rabbi\", such as consulting with native speakers and experts, being aware of cultural sensitivities, and avoiding literal translations that may not convey the full meaning. However, it primarily focuses on the cultural and religious significance of the title in a broader sense, rather than specifically addressing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith.\n\nThe response does mention the importance of respect for the religious significance of the title, which aligns with the concern to ensure an accurate representation of Jesus' role. However, it does not explicitly address how this might impact the translation or provide a clear direction on what that would look like in practice.\n\nTo improve the response and better meet the concern, I would suggest providing more specific guidance on how the cultural significance of \"Rabbi\" should be conveyed in translation, particularly in light of Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith."
