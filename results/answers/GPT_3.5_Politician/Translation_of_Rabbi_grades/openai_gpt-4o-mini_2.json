  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of accurately representing Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith. It provides thoughtful considerations for translating the term \"Rabbi\" while maintaining respect for the significance of the title and being mindful of cultural sensitivities. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly tie the considerations back to the representation of Jesus in teaching within the Christian faith throughout the response."
