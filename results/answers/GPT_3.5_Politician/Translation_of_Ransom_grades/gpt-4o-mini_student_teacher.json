  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided accurate translations of the term 'ransom' into different languages, which demonstrates an understanding of linguistic diversity. However, the student's answer could have been improved by incorporating the theological aspect of the term 'ransom' as highlighted in the reference answer, emphasizing the concept of payment for liberation or redemption with theological implications. Integrating this theological perspective would have enhanced the overall response from a Christian worldview."
