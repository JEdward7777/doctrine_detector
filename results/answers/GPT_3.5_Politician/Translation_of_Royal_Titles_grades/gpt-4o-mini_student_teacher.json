However, the concern specifically emphasized the need for accuracy and respect in translations in the context of biblical teachings. The reference answer provided a more concise and appropriate translation suggestion in line with a Christian worldview. The student could have included a more direct and respectful translation option in line with biblical teachings, such as \"your Highness\" or \"your Excellency,\" to better align with the concern provided."
