While it mentions that \"Your Majesty\" can be translated as other titles such as \"your Highness\" or \"your Excellency,\" it does not provide a comprehensive list of equivalent terms across different languages like the given answer does.\n\nThe concern about biblical teachings is also only tangentially addressed, with no explicit connection made between the translations and their relevance to biblical teachings. However, the response does acknowledge the importance of consulting native speakers or experts for accurate and respectful translations, which is in line with the concern.\n\nTo improve, the response could have provided more specific examples and cultural context, as well as explicitly connected the translations to biblical teachings and the importance of accuracy and respect in addressing titles."
