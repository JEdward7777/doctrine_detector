Grade: 70

Comment: The student's answer is commendable as it strives to be inclusive of individuals from diverse religious backgrounds. However, the teacher's reference answer provides more Christian-specific terminology by emphasizing the connection to Jesus. Encouraging the use of phrases like 'holy believers in Jesus' would better capture the essence of 'saints' within a Christian worldview.
