  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response generally aligns with the concern of using inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus. While it doesn't explicitly mention \"holy believers in Jesus\" as one of the translation options, it does offer alternative terms that are more inclusive and respectful towards people from diverse religious backgrounds. However, it could have gone a step further by specifically mentioning \"believers in Jesus\" to emphasize the connection with Christian faith. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good effort to use language that is sensitive to the diversity of believers and can be improved upon."
