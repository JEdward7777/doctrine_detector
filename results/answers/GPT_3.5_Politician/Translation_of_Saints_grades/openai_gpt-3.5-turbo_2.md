Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides accurate and relevant suggestions for translating the term 'saints' while incorporating the concern for using inclusive language. The use of 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus' maintains the Christian specificity without excluding believers from diverse backgrounds. However, the original recommended translations of "holy individuals" or "sacred figures" were more broad and inclusive, so a slightly higher grade could be achieved by incorporating those suggestions as well.
