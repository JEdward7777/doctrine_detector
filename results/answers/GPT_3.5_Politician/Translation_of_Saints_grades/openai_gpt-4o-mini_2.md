Grade: 85

Comment: The response provided an accurate and appropriate translation for the term 'saints' by suggesting 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus,' which aligns well with representing all believers in Jesus without singling out specific Christian groups. The concern raised about using inclusive language was addressed effectively, although the additional suggestion of "sacred figures" was not necessarily needed to meet the concern. The response overall demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of inclusive language within a Christian worldview.
