  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer acknowledges the importance of cultural and historical connotations of the term \"sanctuary\" in modern texts, which is relevant. However, the student fails to address the specific concern of maintaining the original Biblical meaning of the term. There is a lack of emphasis on ensuring that the translation accurately reflects the Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place. While considering diverse perspectives and cultural nuances is important, the student misses the mark by not focusing on preserving the original Biblical meaning."
