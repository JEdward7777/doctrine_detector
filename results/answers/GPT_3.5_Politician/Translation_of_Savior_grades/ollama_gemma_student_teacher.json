  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the complexities surrounding the translation of 'Savior.' However, it lacks specific engagement with the concern of how such translations shape theological understanding and faith practices. The response would benefit from providing more explicit analysis of how the different translations emphasize God's active role in delivering people from physical and spiritual dangers."
