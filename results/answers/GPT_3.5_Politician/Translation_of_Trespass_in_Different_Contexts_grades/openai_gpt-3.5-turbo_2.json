  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating \"trespass\" as either \"sin\" or \"breaking the rule\" within a church community, considering both the spiritual and relational aspects. It acknowledges the importance of aligning church teachings with scriptural integrity and community values. The response is well-structured, demonstrates critical thinking, and offers practical suggestions for fostering a healthy church community. The only area that could be strengthened is providing more explicit references to Christian teachings or scripture to support the argument."
