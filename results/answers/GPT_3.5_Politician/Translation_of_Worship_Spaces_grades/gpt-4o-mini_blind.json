While the response aims to maintain reverence and inclusivity, it falls short in fully capturing the theological richness and implications of the term. A more doctrinally correct approach would involve emphasizing the specific association with the presence of God and His covenant relationship with His people, rather than simply equating it to a modern concept of a place of worship. There is room for improvement in aligning the translation with the biblical and theological significance of the original phrase."
