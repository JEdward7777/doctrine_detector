  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful and inclusive translation of 'house of Yahweh' as the 'place of worship dedicated to Yahweh'. While the student's translation captures the essence of worship, the reference answer offers a more direct and specific translation as 'Yahweh\u2019s temple' or 'place where Yahweh is worshiped', which better conveys the significance of the worship space. The student's response could be improved by emphasizing the unique presence of Yahweh in the translated phrase."
