I would grade this answer an 70.

Comment: The student provided alternative translations that convey a sense of politeness and encouragement, which aligns with the idea of calling someone's name in a respectful manner. The translations are clear and appropriately capture the meaning of the original phrase in a biblical context. However, there could be room for improvement by incorporating more reverence or solemnity in the translations to better reflect the sacred nature of calling someone's name in a biblical context.
