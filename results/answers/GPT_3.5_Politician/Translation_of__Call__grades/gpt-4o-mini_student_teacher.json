  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided good alternative translations that capture the general idea of calling someone's name in a biblical context. However, they missed the specific nuance highlighted in the reference answer, which emphasized the act of naming someone. Encouraging the student to pay closer attention to nuances in biblical language for more accurate interpretations in the future."
