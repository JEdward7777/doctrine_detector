  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: \nThe student provides a basic explanation of the difference in translation of \"elect\" in older and modern English Bible versions. However, the response lacks depth in discussing the doctrinal significance of the term \"elect\" in Christian theology. The student touches on the idea of predestination but could have elaborated more on the theological implications of this term. Additionally, the answer could have been improved by incorporating relevant Bible verses or citing theologians who have expounded upon the concept of election in Scripture. Overall, while the response provides a general understanding of the translation differences, it lacks in-depth analysis and theological insight."
