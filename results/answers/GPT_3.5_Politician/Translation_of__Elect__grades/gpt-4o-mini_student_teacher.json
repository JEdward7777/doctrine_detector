  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out response that accurately discusses the differences in translation of 'elect' in older and modern English Bible versions, as well as the potential impact on understanding Scripture. The student also correctly addresses the significance of the term in relation to being chosen by God. Overall, it is a thoughtful and insightful answer, with a minor deviation in comparison to the reference answer, hence the slight deduction in points."
