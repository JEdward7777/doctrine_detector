  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the use of \"elect\" and \"chosen\" in older and modern Bible versions and acknowledges the impact of this change in translation on the reader's understanding of being chosen by God. The response effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to this concept. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating more specific examples or references to biblical passages to support the explanation further."
