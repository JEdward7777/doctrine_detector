It addresses the concern raised about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices by emphasizing the balance between respecting the original Hebrew text and making it understandable in different cultural contexts. The response could further explore the theological significance and implications of using the original names of God in relation to cultural practices within a Christian worldview."
