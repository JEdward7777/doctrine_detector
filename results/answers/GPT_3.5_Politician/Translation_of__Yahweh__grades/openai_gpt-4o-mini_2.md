Different churches and religious groups may have different preferences when it comes to using certain names or titles for God.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of traditional translation practices and accessibility for congregations in the choice of using 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh'. However, it could have delved deeper into the significance of using original names of God in conveying the true essence of the divine. The concern raised is valid as it highlights the tension between preserving the original names of God and adapting to cultural practices, which could have been addressed more explicitly in the response.
