However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern provided, which calls for Christians to understand true worship in order to ensure they are honoring God alone. Encouragement to emphasize the primacy of Yahweh as the One True God and the potential dangers of worshiping false gods would have strengthened the response in light of the Christian perspective."
