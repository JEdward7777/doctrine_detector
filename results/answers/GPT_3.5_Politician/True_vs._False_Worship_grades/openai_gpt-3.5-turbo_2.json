The concern about understanding true worship is addressed effectively, emphasizing the importance of directing honor and service to God alone. However, the original response focusing on respecting and tolerating all faiths may potentially be misleading from a Christian perspective, as it is crucial to discern between true worship and worship that leads away from God."
