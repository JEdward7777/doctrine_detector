From a Christian worldview, key criteria such as adherence to biblical teachings, consistency with the character of God, and fulfillment of prophecies should have been mentioned. Additionally, the response could have included references to specific biblical passages that provide guidance on this topic. Encouraging consultation with religious leaders is valid advice, but the answer could have been more robust in providing a Christian perspective on discerning true prophets."
