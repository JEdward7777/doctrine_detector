Grade: 60

Comment: The student's response is respectful and acknowledges the diversity of beliefs surrounding the discernment of prophets, which is commendable. However, the answer lacks specific criteria for distinguishing true prophets from false prophets within a Christian worldview. It would have been stronger if the student had provided more concrete guidance based on aligning messages with God's Word, teachings, and ministry fruits.
