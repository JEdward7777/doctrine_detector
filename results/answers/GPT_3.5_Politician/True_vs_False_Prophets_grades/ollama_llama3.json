  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response acknowledges the importance of discerning true prophets from false ones, which aligns with the concern about being able to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic prophetic voices. The suggestion to consult with religious leaders, scholars, and spiritual guides within one's tradition is also relevant to this concern, as it recognizes the value of seeking guidance from those who are familiar with God's Word and the teachings of their particular faith tradition.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the specific criteria mentioned in the answer (examining if messages align with God's Word, the nature of their teachings, and the fruits of their ministry). While it mentions examining beliefs and perspectives, this is more general and may not be as effective in discerning true prophets. Therefore, I deduct some points for not directly engaging with the provided criteria.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for addressing the concern, but could be improved by incorporating specific biblical or theological concepts to inform the discernment process."
