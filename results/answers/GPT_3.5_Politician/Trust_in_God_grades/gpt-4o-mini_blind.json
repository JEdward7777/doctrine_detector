It does not provide a doctrinally sound explanation that distinguishes hope in God from wishful thinking. In a Christian perspective, having hope in God is grounded in faith and trust in His promises, while merely wishing for something lacks that spiritual foundation. The answer could have been improved by delving into Scripture and theological teachings on the topic."
