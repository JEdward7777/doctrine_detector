  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response acknowledges the diversity of beliefs and the individual nature of finding hope and meaning, it does not directly address the concern of distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation in God versus wishful thinking. The student does not provide a clear explanation of how having hope in God differs from merely wishing for something, which is the main focus of the concern provided. The response lacks depth and specificity in addressing the Christian worldview perspective on hope."
