  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of how brotherly love and romantic love can fit into the biblical definition of love, emphasizing respect, care, and compassion. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on aligning these forms of love with the principles of God's love, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the student provides a solid explanation but could benefit from further depth and clarity in connecting these forms of love to biblical principles."
