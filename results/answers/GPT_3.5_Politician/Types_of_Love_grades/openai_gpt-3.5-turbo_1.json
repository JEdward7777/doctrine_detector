  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively differentiates between brotherly love and romantic love in the context of biblical teachings, emphasizing the importance of both aligning with the principles of God's love. It accurately addresses the concern raised regarding differentiating the types of love while ensuring alignment with a biblical worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide additional biblical references to support the discussion on love, but overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding and application of Christian principles."
