Comment: While it is commendable to promote inclusivity and sensitivity towards different beliefs, as a Christian, it is important to also acknowledge and understand eschatological figures mentioned in the Bible, such as the ultimate antichrist. Understanding these figures is crucial for Christians in preparing for the challenges they may face in their faith journey. The response failed to address this concern from a Christian worldview perspective.
