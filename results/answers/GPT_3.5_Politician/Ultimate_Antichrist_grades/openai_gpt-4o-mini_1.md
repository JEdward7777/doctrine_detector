Comment: The response does not adequately address the concern provided from a Christian worldview. It is important for Christians to be aware of eschatological figures, including the ultimate antichrist mentioned in the Book of Revelation, to prepare for the challenges they may face in their faith. While promoting inclusivity is important, it is also crucial for Christians to understand and discern key biblical teachings, even those that may involve challenging figures or concepts.
