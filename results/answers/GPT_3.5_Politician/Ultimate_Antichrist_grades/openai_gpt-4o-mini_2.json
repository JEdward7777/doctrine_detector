However, the initial response, while well-intentioned in promoting inclusivity, missed the opportunity to engage with the Christian-specific worldview regarding the roles and significance of figures like the antichrist in eschatology. It is important to maintain a balance between respect for diverse beliefs and presenting key Christian teachings accurately."
