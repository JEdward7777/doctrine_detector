  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 20.\n\nComment: The student's response completely misses the point of the question and concern provided. They failed to address the specific actions identified as abominations in the Bible, which was central to the question. Moreover, their avoidance of discussing specific biblical examples contradicts the importance of understanding God's will as outlined in scripture, a concern that was emphasized. This response lacks a Christian worldview perspective and fails to engage with the topic appropriately."
