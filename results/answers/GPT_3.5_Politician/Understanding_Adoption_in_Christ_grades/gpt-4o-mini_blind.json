However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of adoption as a child of God, such as the legal aspect of being heirs and joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17) and the transformation in status from being separated from God to being part of His family. Bringing in these additional aspects would have further enriched the answer."
