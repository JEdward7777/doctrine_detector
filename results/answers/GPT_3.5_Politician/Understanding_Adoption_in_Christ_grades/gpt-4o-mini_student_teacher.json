  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the concept of being adopted as a child of God based on Ephesians 1:5. They accurately explained that through faith in Jesus Christ, believers are welcomed into God's family and highlighted the close, loving relationship and privileges this adoption entails. However, the student could have delved deeper into the idea of believers becoming co-heirs with Christ, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer, to enhance their explanation further from a Christian worldview perspective."
