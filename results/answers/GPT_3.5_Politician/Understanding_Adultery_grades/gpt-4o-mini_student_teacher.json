  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response does not directly address the question about the consequences of committing adultery according to the Bible. Instead, it focuses on the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and engaging in respectful dialogue, which is valuable but not relevant to the given question and concern. The student's answer lacks substance and depth in addressing the specific topic from a Christian worldview."
