However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing that in traditional Christian belief, eternal life is not earned through a combination of faith and works, but rather is a gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone, as stated in Ephesians 2:8-9. Additionally, a clearer distinction between the various Christian denominations' diverse understandings of this concept could be provided."
