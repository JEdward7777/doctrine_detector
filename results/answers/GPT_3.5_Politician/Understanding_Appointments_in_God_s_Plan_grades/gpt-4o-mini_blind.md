Comment: The answer provides a general overview of the concept of being "appointed to eternal life" in a Christian context, mentioning elements such as salvation, faith, and acceptance of Jesus Christ. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing that in traditional Christian belief, eternal life is not earned through a combination of faith and works, but rather is a gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone, as stated in Ephesians 2:8-9. Additionally, a clearer distinction between the various Christian denominations' diverse understandings of this concept could be provided.
