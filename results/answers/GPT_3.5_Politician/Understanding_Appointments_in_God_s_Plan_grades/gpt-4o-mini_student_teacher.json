  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, highlighting the importance of faith, actions, and accepting Jesus Christ as savior. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on divine selection and grace as essential components in the concept. Encouraging the student to expound more on God's sovereign will and grace in relation to being appointed to eternal life would strengthen the response."
