  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in Christian theology, specifically highlighting God's sovereignty and grace in selecting individuals for salvation. The language used is clear and concise, and the response provides a brief but relevant overview of the topic.\n\nHowever, I deduct some points because the response does not fully engage with the concern of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation. While it mentions God's sovereign will and grace, it could have explored this concept more deeply and explicitly connected it to the idea of being \"appointed to eternal life\". Additionally, while the response acknowledges that interpretations may vary among Christian traditions, it does not provide any specific examples or engage with diverse perspectives on this topic.\n\nOverall, a good effort, but some room for further development and engagement with the concern at hand."
