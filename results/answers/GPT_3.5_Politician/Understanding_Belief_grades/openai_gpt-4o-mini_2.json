It also emphasizes the importance of trust in individuals. However, the response could have further delved into how faith in God differs from trust in others, highlighting the unique nature of faith in a divine being compared to human relationships. Some additional depth on the spiritual aspect of faith in relation to trust in God would have strengthened the response within a Christian worldview."
