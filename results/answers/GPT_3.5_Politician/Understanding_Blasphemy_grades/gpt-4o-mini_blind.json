  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 70. \n\nWhile the student touched on the importance of respecting beliefs and being mindful of language, there is a lack of depth in discussing the biblical implications of speaking against God or others and defining blasphemy within the Scriptures. The response remained quite general and did not delve deeply into the specific teachings of the Bible on this topic. More scriptural references and a thorough explanation of how blasphemy is understood in Christianity would have strengthened the answer. The student did well in promoting open-mindedness and respect, but for a higher grade, a more comprehensive discussion rooted in biblical teachings would be necessary."
