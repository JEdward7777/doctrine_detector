The concern regarding the significance of vows and commitments in maintaining a healthy spiritual life is addressed adequately. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the importance of upholding and honoring these commitments in light of a Christian worldview. Additionally, integrating relevant biblical passages or examples could have enriched the response further."
