  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response is thoughtful and demonstrates an understanding of the concept of \"bonds\" in a spiritual context. The candidate acknowledges the importance of diverse interpretations but still manages to center the discussion around commitments to God and others as outlined in scripture. The response could be improved by further emphasizing the importance of vows and commitments in upholding a healthy spiritual life, specifically tying these concepts back to the Biblical understanding of bonds."
