It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding cleanliness can guide believers in their personal and communal lives. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly connect this interpretation to the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and fostering understanding among different religious traditions, which could enhance the overall unity and inclusivity in discussing such topics from a Christian worldview."
