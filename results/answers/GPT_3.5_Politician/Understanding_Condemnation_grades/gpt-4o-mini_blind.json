  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The response completely avoids addressing the specific question about the teachings of the Bible on the nature of condemnation as referenced in 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16. It fails to provide a Christian worldview perspective or engage with the biblical passages cited. It prioritizes political correctness and sensitivity over doctrinal correctness and the exploration of Christian teachings."
