  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 60\n\n**Comment:** \nWhile the student's answer demonstrates respect for diverse beliefs and encourages open-mindedness, it does not directly address the specific concern of understanding the contrast between condemnation and grace in the Christian life, as referenced in the verses. The response lacks theological insight or interpretation of the biblical passages."
