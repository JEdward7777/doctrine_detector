However, it could have delved deeper into the specific consequences of cursing others as mentioned in James 3:10. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the Biblical perspective of the sinfulness and harm of cursing others, as well as how it goes against God's commands, would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response."
