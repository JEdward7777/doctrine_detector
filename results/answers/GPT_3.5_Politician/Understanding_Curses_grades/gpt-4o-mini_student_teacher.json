  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed and thoughtful response that emphasizes the importance of using words wisely and promoting harmony. However, the student's answer lacks a direct connection to the specific spiritual consequences of cursing as outlined in James 3:10. For a higher grade, the student should focus more on the spiritual implications and consequences of cursing as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
