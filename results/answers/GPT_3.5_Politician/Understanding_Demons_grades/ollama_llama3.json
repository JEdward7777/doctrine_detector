  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that \"unclean spirit\" refers to negative spiritual forces, which aligns with the correct answer. However, it falls short in providing more clarity on the nature and characteristics of demons and their influence on individuals, as specified in the concern. The response also takes a neutral stance by acknowledging diverse beliefs and perspectives, rather than offering a clear biblical explanation.\n\nTo improve this response, the writer could have provided more scriptural support and elaboration on the nature and characteristics of demons, such as their motivations, tactics, and impact on individuals."
