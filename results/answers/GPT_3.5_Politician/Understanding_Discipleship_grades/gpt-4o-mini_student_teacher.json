  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student acknowledged the diversity of perspectives on being a disciple of Jesus, but their answer lacked a clear understanding of the responsibilities and definition of being a disciple according to the Christian worldview. They missed emphasizing the importance of belief in Jesus, obedience to His teachings, and following His example. The response could have been strengthened by incorporating more specific references to Christian beliefs and scriptures."
