It is crucial to incorporate specific scriptural passages that highlight the divine nature of God's judgment and the sinful nature of human judgment to align more closely with a Christian worldview. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of repentance, faith in Christ, and the need for salvation in the face of God's righteous judgment would enhance the response."
