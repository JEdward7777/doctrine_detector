However, the answer lacks specific biblical references and the key aspect of how God's judgment often includes both punishment and a call to repentance in response to sin, which is crucial in understanding the difference between the two. Additionally, promoting respect, diversity, and compassion, while important values, may not directly address the concern of comparing God's judgment to human judgment from a Christian worldview."
