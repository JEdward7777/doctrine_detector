  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment, emphasizing the biblical perspective on judgment and sin. It aligns well with a Christian worldview and provides a clear insight into the significance of recognizing the limitations of human judgment in comparison to God's righteous judgment. Great job overall!"
