  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer at 90.\n\nWhile the student's response is comprehensive and aligns well with the teacher's answer, it slightly lacks specificity in mentioning justice as one of the key attributes of God's divine nature. It would enhance the answer if justice were included, as it is a fundamental characteristic of God in Christian theology. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of divine nature and its implications for God's characteristics."
