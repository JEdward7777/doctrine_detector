  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response lacks specificity and clarity in addressing the question from a Christian perspective. The focus should have been on the importance of obedience to God's laws and faith in Him as the primary means of inheriting eternal life, in line with Christian beliefs. The student's answer, while acknowledging the diversity of beliefs, falls short in emphasizing key Christian teachings on this topic."
