However, the concern raised emphasizes the crucial aspect of eternity in Christian faith, and the response could have focused more on the specific Christian understanding of salvation through Jesus Christ as central to attaining eternal life for believers. Further elaboration on the unique Christian perspective on this topic would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview."
