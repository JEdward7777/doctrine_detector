However, the response could have been more distinct in its Christian worldview by explicitly referencing Jesus as the means to eternal life, as stated in John 14:6. Additionally, while acknowledging the diversity of beliefs is important, it is crucial to assert the specific Christian perspective clearly in discussions of eternal life inheritance."
