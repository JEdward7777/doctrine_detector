However, the initial response lacks specificity in directly addressing the concern regarding the crucial aspect of eternity in Christian faith. It would have been stronger if it delved deeper into the significance of attaining eternal life in the Christian worldview, emphasizing the centrality of Jesus Christ and His redemptive work for salvation."
