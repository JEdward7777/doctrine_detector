  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear explanation of the distinction between 'evil' and 'wickedness' in terms of moral character and behavior according to biblical teachings. The response focuses more on sensitivity and respecting different perspectives rather than providing a direct answer to the question. Moving forward, the student should strive to incorporate specific biblical references and explanations to address concerns related to moral implications of behaviors and character in the context of biblical teachings."
