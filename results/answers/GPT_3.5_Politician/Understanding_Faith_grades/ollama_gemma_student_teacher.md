As a politician, it is important for me to respect and acknowledge all religious beliefs. When someone says they have faith in Jesus, it typically means they believe in the teachings, values, and principles attributed to Jesus Christ in the Christian faith. It is a personal belief and expression of spirituality that should be treated with respect and understanding, regardless of one's own beliefs or background.
