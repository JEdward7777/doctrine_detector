Comment: The response acknowledges the implication of the term "faithless" regarding belief in God. However, the emphasis on sensitivity and subjectivity, while important in some contexts, downplays the objective reality of faith as understood in a Christian worldview. Additionally, the answer could have benefited from a clearer connection to the concept of faith as defined in Christianity.
