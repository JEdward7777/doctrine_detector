  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a partial understanding of the concept of \"faithless\" within a Christian worldview. While they correctly explain that faith is personal and subjective, their response fails to address the concern of recognizing the significance of faith in moral conduct. The answer lacks clarity in linking the concept of faithlessness to immoral actions as specified in the reference answer."
