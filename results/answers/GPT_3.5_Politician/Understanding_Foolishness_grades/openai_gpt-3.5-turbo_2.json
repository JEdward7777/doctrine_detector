The concern of understanding this definition in reflecting on one's relationship with God and the importance of obedience is duly noted. However, the initial response on respecting individuals of all faiths and backgrounds is commendable, but it lacks a clear alignment with the Christian belief that true wisdom comes from faith in God. Striving for sensitivity and understanding in discussions about religion is crucial, but it should also involve sharing the truth of the Gospel as Christians are called to spread the Good News."
