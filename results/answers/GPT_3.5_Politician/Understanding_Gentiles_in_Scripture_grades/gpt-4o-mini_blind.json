It correctly mentions the initial barriers and tensions between Jews and Gentiles, the influence of Jesus' teachings on love and inclusivity, and the efforts made by early church leaders to bridge the gap between the two groups. The answer could be strengthened by incorporating specific scriptural references or examples from the New Testament to support its points and by delving deeper into the theological implications of this shift in perception. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of the Holy Spirit's role in breaking down cultural and religious barriers could further enrich the analysis. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological exploration."
