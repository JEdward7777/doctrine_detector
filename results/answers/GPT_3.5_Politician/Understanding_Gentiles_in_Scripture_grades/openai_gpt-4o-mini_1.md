## [Answer](../Understanding_Gentiles_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
In the early church, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles played a significant role in shaping their relationships with them. The Israelites, as followers of the Jewish faith, historically viewed Gentiles as outsiders or non-Jews. This perception, rooted in cultural and religious differences, often led to tensions and barriers between the two groups.

However, as the early church grew and expanded, there was a gradual shift in attitudes towards Gentiles. This transition was influenced by the teachings of Jesus Christ, who emphasized love, inclusion, and acceptance of all people, regardless of their background. The Israelites began to recognize the humanity and spiritual potential of Gentiles, leading to a more open and inclusive approach to building relationships with them.

Despite the challenges and prejudices that existed, the early church leaders worked towards fostering unity and understanding between Jews and Gentiles. They encouraged dialogue, cooperation, and mutual respect, ultimately paving the way for a more harmonious relationship within the Christian community.

It is important to acknowledge the complexity of these historical dynamics and the evolving nature of relationships between different groups. By understanding and appreciating the various perspectives and experiences of all individuals involved, we can strive for greater understanding, empathy, and cooperation in our interactions with others.
