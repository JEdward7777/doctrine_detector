It acknowledges the struggle believers may have in comprehending the implications of God's sovereignty in their personal lives. The only area for improvement would be to further clarify how believers can practically apply the concept of God's authority in their daily lives, providing more specific examples or scripture references to enhance the explanation from a Christian perspective."
