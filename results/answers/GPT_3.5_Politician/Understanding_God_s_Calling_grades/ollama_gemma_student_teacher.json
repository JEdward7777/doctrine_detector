  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of being \"called\" by God from a Christian perspective. It acknowledges the personal and spiritual nature of this experience and emphasizes its connection to purpose and direction in life. The response also highlights the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and approaching discussions with sensitivity. However, it could benefit from a more explicit connection to the teacher's reference answer regarding God's specific purpose and work."
