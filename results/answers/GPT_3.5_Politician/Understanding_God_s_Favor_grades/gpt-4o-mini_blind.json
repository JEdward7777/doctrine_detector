However, the answer could improve by highlighting the foundational Christian belief that Jesus is the Son of God who lived a sinless life, and His demonstration of favor with God and men was ultimately rooted in His divine nature and mission to bring salvation. The emphasis on inclusivity should be balanced with the biblical teachings on repentance and faith in Jesus for salvation."
