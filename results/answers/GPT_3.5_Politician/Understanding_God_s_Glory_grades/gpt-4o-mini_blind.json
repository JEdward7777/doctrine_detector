The mention of reverence, humility, and recognizing something greater than ourselves in relation to God's glory is good. However, the response lacks depth in exploring the distinctiveness of God's glory compared to worldly glory. It could have delved deeper into the biblical foundation of God's glory and how it contrasts with the transient and often selfish nature of worldly glory. Additionally, the answer could have highlighted the eternal and unchanging nature of God's glory as opposed to the fleeting nature of worldly acclaim. Incorporating more scriptural references and theological insights would strengthen the response."
