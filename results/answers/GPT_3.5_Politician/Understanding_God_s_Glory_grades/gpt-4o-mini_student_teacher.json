  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general overview of the concept of God's glory in the Bible and makes a fair comparison to worldly sources of glory. However, the response lacks depth and fails to fully capture the unique and supreme nature of God's glory as revealed in the reference answer. To align more closely with a Christian worldview, the student should emphasize the transcendence and holiness of God's glory, emphasizing its immeasurable superiority over any earthly forms of glory."
