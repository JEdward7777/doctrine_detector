  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the difference between God's glory and worldly sources of glory. They effectively highlight the central themes of reverence, humility, and the recognition of something greater than oneself in relation to God's glory. The response also acknowledges the diversity of perspectives and the need for sensitivity and respect when discussing religious teachings. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the unique and supreme nature of God's glory as described in the teacher's reference answer."
