  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The provided response does a good job in explaining the concept of God's glory in the Bible as being immeasurably superior to earthly glory and how it reveals God's character and presence. The response also highlights the importance of understanding the unique and supreme nature of God's glory for proper worship, which aligns well with the specified concern. However, the response could further emphasize the distinctiveness of God's glory compared to worldly sources and reiterate the significance of worshiping God in light of His unmatched glory."
