While the explanation is sufficient, the answer could be improved by highlighting the central role of Scripture in discerning God's will and the significance of surrendering one's own desires to align with God's plans. Additionally, a more explicit reference to the Christian perspective on seeking God's will would strengthen the response within a Christian worldview."
