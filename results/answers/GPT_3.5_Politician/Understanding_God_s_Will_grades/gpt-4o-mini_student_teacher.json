However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on aligning decisions with God's desires as revealed in Scripture, which is a critical aspect in seeking God's will according to a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to prioritize scriptural guidance and aligning choices with God's revealed will would strengthen their understanding."
