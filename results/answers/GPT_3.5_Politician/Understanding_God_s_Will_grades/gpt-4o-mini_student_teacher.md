Comment: The student's response provides a general understanding of seeking God's will in everyday decisions, mentioning the importance of guidance, wisdom, prayer, and seeking advice from spiritual sources. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on aligning decisions with God's desires as revealed in Scripture, which is a critical aspect in seeking God's will according to a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to prioritize scriptural guidance and aligning choices with God's revealed will would strengthen their understanding.
