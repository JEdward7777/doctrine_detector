  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern about people struggling with making decisions that honor God or feeling uncertain about His direction for their lives. It acknowledges that seeking God's will involves being open to guidance and wisdom, considering one's values and beliefs, and possibly seeking advice from spiritual leaders or mentors. This approach can help individuals feel more confident in their decision-making process.\n\nHowever, the response falls short of fully addressing the concern because it does not explicitly emphasize the importance of understanding Scripture as a key factor in seeking God's will. The answer provided as the correct solution only mentions Scripture as a means to understand God's desires and plans, but this is not directly addressed in the response being graded.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could have more clearly emphasized the role of Scripture in guiding decision-making and aligning one's choices with what pleases God."
