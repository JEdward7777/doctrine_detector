  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response lacks doctrinal correctness as it does not directly address the question about the nature of God's wrath and human anger according to the Bible. It leans towards a relative viewpoint that does not align with a Christian worldview that upholds the authoritative nature of Scripture. In the context of discussing biblical teachings, it is important to prioritize presenting accurate information based on the teachings of the Bible."
