  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response acknowledges the importance of respecting diverse religious views and being open to various perspectives, which is a good approach when discussing sensitive topics like the nature of God's wrath. However, the answer lacks a clear explanation or comparison of the differences between God's wrath and human anger as requested in the question. It would have been beneficial for the student to provide more specific insights or interpretations from a Christian worldview to fully address the concern raised."
