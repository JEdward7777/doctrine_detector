  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the concern expressed by the teacher. They acknowledge the importance of respecting diverse interpretations of religious texts and approach the topic with sensitivity. However, the response lacks specific elaboration on the nature of God's wrath and its differences from human anger, as requested in the question."
