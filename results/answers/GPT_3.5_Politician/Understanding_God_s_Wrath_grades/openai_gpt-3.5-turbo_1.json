  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately defines God's wrath as an intense, righteous judgment of sin and distinguishes it from human anger, noting that God's wrath is a measured response, not a fit of rage. The response reflects a sound understanding of the Christian perspective on God's wrath in relation to sin and emphasizes the importance of recognizing the righteous nature of God's actions. The only suggestion for improvement would be to elaborate further on how God's measured response to sin aligns with His justice and holiness."
