  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a clear and accurate explanation of grace in a Christian context, highlighting its unmerited nature and emphasis on God's favor towards humanity. They effectively convey the idea of grace as a gift from God that brings forgiveness and salvation. However, the student could have strengthened their response by incorporating the concept of grace as help or blessing given by God to sinful human beings that is freely bestowed and not earned, as emphasized in the reference answer."
