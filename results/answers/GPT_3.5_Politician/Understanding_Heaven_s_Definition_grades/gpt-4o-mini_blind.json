However, the answer lacks specific biblical references and does not fully capture the Christian perspective on 'heaven' as a realm where God dwells and believers go to spend eternity in His presence. Additionally, the explanation of the difference between 'heaven' and 'sky' could be more precise in emphasizing the spiritual versus the physical nature of these terms from a Christian worldview. Encouraging respect for diverse perspectives is commendable but should be balanced with a clear presentation of Christian beliefs."
