  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a general overview of the concept of heaven and sky, but did not specifically address the biblical definitions as requested in the question. Additionally, while the student emphasized respect for diverse perspectives, a Christian-specific worldview focuses on aligning beliefs with biblical teachings rather than accommodating various interpretations. There is room for improvement in connecting the answer to the concern provided in order to deepen the understanding of God's nature and relationship with Him through the biblical definitions."
