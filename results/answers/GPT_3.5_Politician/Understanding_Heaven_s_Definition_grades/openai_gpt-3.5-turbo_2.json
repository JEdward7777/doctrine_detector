  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively aligns with the concern provided by emphasizing the significance of understanding the specific meanings of \"heaven\" and \"sky\" in Scripture to deepen our comprehension of God's nature and our connection with Him. The explanation given is clear and directly addresses the concern from a Christian worldview perspective. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a bit more depth or examples to enhance the response further."
