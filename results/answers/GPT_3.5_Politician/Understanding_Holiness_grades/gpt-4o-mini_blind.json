It misses the opportunity to expound on Christian beliefs about the nature of God and the implications of His holiness on our lives. In a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize doctrinal correctness and provide specific insights from the Bible on this topic. The response focused more on promoting inclusivity and tolerance rather than addressing the core theological aspects of the question."
