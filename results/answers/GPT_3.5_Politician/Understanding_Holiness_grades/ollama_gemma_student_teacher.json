  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 60/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer lacks specific theological insight or engagement with the concept of God's absolute holiness as related to the question. While it emphasizes inclusivity and tolerance, it does not address the specific concern of reflecting on our own holiness and approaching a holy God. The response would be more appropriate for a discussion about religious tolerance or political inclusivity rather than for addressing the theological concept of God's holiness."
