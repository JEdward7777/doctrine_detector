However, it overlooks the crucial Christian concept of God's absolute holiness and our sinful nature that requires God's allowance for approaching Him. The concern raised about reflecting on our own holiness and approaching a holy God is not addressed in the response, indicating a lack of alignment with a Christian-specific worldview."
