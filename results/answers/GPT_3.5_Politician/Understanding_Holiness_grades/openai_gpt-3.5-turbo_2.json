However, the initial response focused more on promoting inclusivity and tolerance towards all faiths without emphasizing the importance of recognizing the need for personal holiness and repentance in approaching a holy God. This overlooks the crucial aspect of sinfulness and the need for redemption through Christ, which would have strengthened the Christian perspective in addressing the concern raised."
