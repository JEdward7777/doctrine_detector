However, the concern presented emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's absolute holiness and our need for His allowance due to our sinful nature, which is a key aspect of Christian theology that could have been incorporated more explicitly in the response. Overall, the response could have connected the inclusivity aspect with the concept of God's holiness to provide a more comprehensive Christian perspective on the matter."
