While promoting inclusivity and tolerance is important, the response could have incorporated a Christian perspective on how individuals can approach a holy God despite their sinfulness. Encouraging understanding and cooperation among different religious communities is commendable, but it is also vital to address the fundamental Christian belief in the need for redemption through Christ to approach God."
