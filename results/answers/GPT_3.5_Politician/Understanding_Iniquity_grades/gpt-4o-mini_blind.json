  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 85.\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the general concept of iniquity, sin, and transgression in the Bible. They correctly point out that these terms all refer to wrongful actions that go against God's commands. The explanation provided is clear and concise. \n\nHowever, the student could have emphasized the specific biblical definitions and distinctions between these terms more clearly in relation to Christian doctrine. Additionally, mentioning the gravity of these actions in the context of salvation and redemption could have enhanced the depth of the response. \n\nOverall, a solid answer that shows understanding, but could have delved deeper into the doctrinal nuances of these terms."
