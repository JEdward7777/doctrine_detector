  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of the distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression. They correctly identify iniquity as a deeper level of sin, sin as a broader term encompassing any act against God's will, and transgression as specific violations of commands or laws. However, the student could improve by providing a more precise definition of iniquity as deliberate acts of great wickedness and by emphasizing the significance of recognizing these distinctions for Christians in understanding the gravity of their actions and seeking repentance."
