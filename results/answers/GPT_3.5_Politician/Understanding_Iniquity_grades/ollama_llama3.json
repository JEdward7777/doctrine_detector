  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the correct answer, accurately describing the nuances of each term (iniquity, sin, and transgression). The concern that understanding these distinctions can help Christians recognize the gravity of their actions and seek repentance is also reflected in the response. Well done!\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:\n\n1. Some of the language is not as precise or Biblically grounded as it could be. For example, describing \"iniquity\" as \"deliberate acts of wrongdoing or great wickedness\" doesn't quite capture the depth and complexity of this concept in Scripture.\n2. The response might benefit from more explicit connection to Christian theology and practice. While it mentions seeking repentance, a deeper exploration of how these distinctions can inform our understanding of sin and salvation could be valuable.\n\nOverall, though, this is a solid effort that demonstrates a good grasp of the basics!"
