## [Answer](../Understanding_Iniquity.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
Thank you for your question. Different translations of the Bible may use different terms, but in general, iniquity, sin, and transgression are all considered to be wrongful actions that go against God's commands. Iniquity is often seen as a deeper level of sin, indicating a more persistent and deliberate pattern of wrongdoing. Sin is a broader term encompassing any act or thought that goes against God's will. Transgression specifically refers to the violation of a specific command or law. It is important to approach these terms with respect for the diverse interpretations within different religious traditions.
