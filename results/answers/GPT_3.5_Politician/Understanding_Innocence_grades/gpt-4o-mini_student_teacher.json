  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of innocence in the context of wrongful accusations according to biblical teachings. Their explanation aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. However, the student could improve by emphasizing the biblical principle of innocence meaning not deserving of punishment more explicitly. Overall, a well-reasoned and insightful response that reflects a good comprehension of the Christian worldview on this topic."
