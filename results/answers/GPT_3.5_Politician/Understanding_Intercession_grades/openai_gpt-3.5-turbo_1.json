  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a clear and aligned statement with the biblical teaching that the Holy Spirit intercedes for us in prayer. It demonstrated a foundational understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in intercession. The response could have been improved by delving deeper into specific biblical passages or examples that illustrate the Holy Spirit's involvement in prayer and intercession, hence the slight deduction in the grade."
