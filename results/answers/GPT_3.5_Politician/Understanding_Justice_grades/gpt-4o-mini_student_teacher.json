  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response acknowledges the importance of respect for diverse perspectives but lacks a clear explanation of what it means to act justly according to God's laws. The biblical standard of fairness and righteousness is not clearly addressed in the student's answer, which is critical to understanding this concept from a Christian worldview. More emphasis on practicing fairness, honesty, and integrity in accordance with God's laws would have strengthened the response."
