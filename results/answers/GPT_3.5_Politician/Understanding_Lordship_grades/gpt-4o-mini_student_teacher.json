  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a clear explanation of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus, emphasizing authority, power, and divine roles. However, the answer could have been improved by specifically mentioning the significance of the term 'Lord' as indicating ownership and divinity, especially when used in conjunction with \"Jesus\" or \"Jesus Christ\" as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, incorporating more references to Bible verses that illustrate the concept of 'Lord' in relation to Jesus and God would have strengthened the answer."
