  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 90. The student has provided a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's character from a Christian worldview. They accurately describe how majesty signifies God's greatness, authority, and awe-inspiring presence, as well as the reverence and respect due to His power and sovereignty. The only small improvement could be adding a bit more depth or Scriptural references to further support their explanation, but overall, it is a solid response."
