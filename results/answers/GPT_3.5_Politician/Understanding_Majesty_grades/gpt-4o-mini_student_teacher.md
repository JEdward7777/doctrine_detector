80.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 80. 

The student correctly mentions that the term "majesty" signifies God's greatness, supreme authority, and awe-inspiring presence, which aligns with the reference answer. However, there is a slight lack of emphasis on God being the supreme King over the universe in the student's response, which is an important aspect when understanding God's attributes and sovereignty. Therefore, a score of 80 reflects that the student's answer is mostly accurate but could benefit from further elaboration on God's kingship in connection to His majesty.
