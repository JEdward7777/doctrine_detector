  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The answer lacks doctrinal correctness as it presents a vague and inclusive interpretation of the concept of perishing in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. The response does not accurately reflect the specific Christian understanding of perishing, which is typically understood in the context of eternal separation from God and the consequence of rejecting salvation through Jesus Christ. It is important for the student to provide a more precise and doctrinally sound explanation based on biblical teachings."
