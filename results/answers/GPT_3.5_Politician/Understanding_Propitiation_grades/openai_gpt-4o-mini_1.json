It directly addresses the concern by highlighting how propitiation is linked to both God's justice and mercy. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the foundational concept of atonement for sin through Jesus Christ. The only minor suggestion would be to incorporate more Scriptures or references to support the explanation, which would further strengthen the response."
