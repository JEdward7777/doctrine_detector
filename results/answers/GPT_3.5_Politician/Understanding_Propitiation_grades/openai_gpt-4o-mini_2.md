Grade: 75

Comment: The response acknowledges the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in satisfying God's justice and appeasing His wrath, which aligns with Christian beliefs. However, it lacks a clear connection to how propitiation specifically relates to God's justice and mercy. A stronger link between propitiation, God's justice, and mercy would have further strengthened the response in addressing the concern.
