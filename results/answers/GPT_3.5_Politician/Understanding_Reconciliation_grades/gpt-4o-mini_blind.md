Comment: The response misses the mark by not addressing the biblical concept of reconciliation through Jesus Christ in addressing the issue of sin. It is important to focus on the doctrinal aspects of Christianity and the specific teachings of Jesus Christ in addressing sin and reconciliation. Encouraging understanding and compassion is good, but the core doctrinal beliefs should be central in this context.
