Comment: The response effectively ties the concept of 'remnant' to the source of strength being God's grace extended to believers who remain faithful during trials. However, the response could have delved deeper into explaining how God's grace specifically provides the strength needed during difficult times, from a Christian perspective. Clarifying this connection would have further strengthened the response.
