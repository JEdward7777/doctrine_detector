The answer correctly highlights Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, drawing parallels to the sacrificial lambs. However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing Jesus' role as the fulfillment of God's plan for redemption more explicitly, in line with the concern's emphasis on understanding Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption."
