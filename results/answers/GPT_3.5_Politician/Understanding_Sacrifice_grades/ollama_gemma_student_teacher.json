They accurately explain the significance of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate atonement for sins and draw a parallel between his sacrifice and the sacrificial lambs in the Old Testament. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit explanation of how Jesus' sacrifice differs from the Old Testament sacrifices."
