It aligns well with the Christian belief that Jesus, as a perfect and unblemished sacrifice, paid for the sins of people, reflecting the sacrificial system established in the Old Testament. The answer effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the important theological connection between Jesus' sacrificial role and God's plan for redemption."
