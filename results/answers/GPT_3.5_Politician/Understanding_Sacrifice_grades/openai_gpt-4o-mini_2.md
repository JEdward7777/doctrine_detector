The term "Lamb of God" in relation to Jesus is a deeply symbolic and spiritual concept in Christian theology. It is commonly understood as a reference to Jesus being the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity, drawing parallels to the sacrificial lambs in the Old Testament that were offered as atonement for sins. This symbolizes Jesus' willing self-sacrifice and his role in bringing about salvation and redemption for all mankind.

The explanation aligns well with the Christian worldview concerning the sacrificial role of Jesus in God's plan for redemption.
