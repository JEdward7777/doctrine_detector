  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a good explanation of how the term \"Shaddai\" is used in the Old Testament and its significance in highlighting God's power, strength, and provision for His people, there are some key aspects missing in relation to understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. The student did not mention the possible origins or etymology of the term \"Shaddai\" as the reference answer did, which is significant in understanding the deeper meaning and symbolism of the term in Hebrew culture and religion.\n\nTherefore, the student's answer demonstrates a decent understanding of the term \"Shaddai\" but lacks in fully exploring the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture in relation to this term."
