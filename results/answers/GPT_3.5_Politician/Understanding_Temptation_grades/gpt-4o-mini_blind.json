  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies some key strategies used by Jesus to resist temptations, such as spiritual strength, knowledge of scripture, and trust in God. However, it could be improved by delving deeper into the specific actions or responses Jesus took during the temptations in the wilderness (e.g., quoting Scripture, rebuking Satan). Additionally, the answer could have emphasized the importance of relying on God's strength rather than solely individual effort. Overall, a solid response but lacking in depth and specificity."
