  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately highlights Jesus' use of spiritual strength, knowledge of scripture, and trust in God to resist Satan's temptations, which aligns with the correct answer. It also emphasizes the importance of finding one's own strategy for resisting temptation, which is relevant to the concern of understanding how to combat temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by more explicitly stating Jesus' reliance on scripture and faith in God, as mentioned in the correct answer. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the importance of finding one's own strategy for resisting temptation, it could provide more specific guidance or examples from Scripture to support this idea.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account of Jesus' encounter with Satan and applies it to a relevant concern, but could be improved by more explicitly highlighting Jesus' reliance on scripture and faith in God."
