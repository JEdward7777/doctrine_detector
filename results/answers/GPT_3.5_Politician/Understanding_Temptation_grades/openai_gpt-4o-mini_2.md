Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively ties Jesus' use of scripture and faith to resist temptation to the concern of combating temptation as a follower of Christ. The additional mention of spiritual strength and the idea that different strategies may work for different individuals slightly veers away from the specific Christian perspective being sought for in this context. Overall, a strong connection is made between the answer and the concern, hence the high grade.
