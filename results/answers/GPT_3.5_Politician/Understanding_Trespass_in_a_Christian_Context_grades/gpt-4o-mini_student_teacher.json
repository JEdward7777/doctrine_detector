  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a decent understanding of the concept of trespass and its relationship to sin in a Christian worldview. However, the response lacks clarity in explicitly stating that all sins are considered trespasses against God in Christianity. The student could have strengthened their explanation by emphasizing the inherent connection between personal violations and sins against God within Christian ethics. Overall, the answer shows a good grasp of the concept but could benefit from deeper theological insight."
