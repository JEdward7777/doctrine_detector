The answer tends to prioritize sensitivity over doctrinal correctness, ultimately diluting the distinct Christian perspective on the topic. The language used lacks clarity and specificity in identifying behaviors that go against biblical teachings. To improve, the response should emphasize the importance of aligning one's actions with God's Word and highlight the significance of repentance, redemption, and sanctification in addressing behaviors considered unholy from a Christian perspective."
