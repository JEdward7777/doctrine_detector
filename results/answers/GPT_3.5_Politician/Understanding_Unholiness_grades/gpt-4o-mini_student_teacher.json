  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer is well-written and shows sensitivity to diverse perspectives, which is commendable. However, the student's response does not align with a Christian worldview as it avoids using the term \"unholy\" and does not address the specific characteristics of an 'unholy' life as outlined in the reference answer. Without acknowledging the Christian perspective and criteria for identifying unholiness, the response falls short in providing a complete and accurate understanding of the concept."
