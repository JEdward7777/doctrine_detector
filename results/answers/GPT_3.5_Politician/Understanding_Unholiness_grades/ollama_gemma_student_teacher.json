They avoid using religious jargon that might be offensive to those with different beliefs, and instead focus on discussing behaviors that are harmful or unethical. They provide clear examples of such behaviors, and emphasize the importance of promoting respect, fairness, kindness, and compassion. While their response does not fully align with the provided reference answer, it demonstrates a strong grasp of the underlying concepts and offers a valuable perspective."
