The focus on promoting understanding, empathy, and equality aligns well with Christian values of love and compassion. However, the choice to avoid using the term \"unholy\" in favor of more secular terms may miss an opportunity to highlight the importance of honoring God and pursuing holiness in alignment with the Christian worldview. Encouraging self-examination and awareness of how unholiness can influence behavior is a key aspect of aligning actions with Christian principles."
