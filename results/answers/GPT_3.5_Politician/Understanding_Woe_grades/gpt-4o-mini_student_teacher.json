  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response captures the general essence of the term \"woe\" in biblical warnings and judgments by emphasizing sorrow and concern. However, the answer lacks the crucial element of linking 'woe' specifically to the consequences of sin and the concept of suffering as punishment. To improve, the student should focus on incorporating the theological aspect of 'woe' in relation to sin and judgment as outlined in the Christian worldview."
