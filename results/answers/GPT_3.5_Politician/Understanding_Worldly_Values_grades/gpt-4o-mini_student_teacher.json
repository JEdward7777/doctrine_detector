  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 70.\n\nWhile the student's answer provides a good understanding of the term \"worldly\" in Christian teachings and correctly identifies behaviors and values that conflict with godly principles, the student's response focuses more on the negative aspects of worldly attitudes rather than the evil connotation emphasized in the teacher's reference answer. The student could improve their response by incorporating more language that aligns with the explicit mention of evil values and behaviors in the reference answer.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept but could enhance their answer by incorporating the specifically highlighted emphasis on evil in worldly values and behaviors from the provided reference."
