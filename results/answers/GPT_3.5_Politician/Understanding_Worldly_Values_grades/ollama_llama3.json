  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does touch on the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, acknowledging that worldly things prioritize material possessions, status, or pleasure over spiritual values. It also mentions the importance of humility, compassion, and faith in Christian life. However, the response could be improved by more explicitly highlighting the negative connotations of \"worldly\" in Christian teachings.\n\nThe given answer is a good starting point, but it's too narrow and doesn't fully capture the complexity of the concept. The concern about understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles is well-addressed in this response, but it could be further developed with more specific examples or biblical references to support its claims.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the general idea, but could benefit from more nuance and depth to fully address the concern."
