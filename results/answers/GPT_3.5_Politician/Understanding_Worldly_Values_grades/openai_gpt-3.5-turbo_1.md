In Christian teachings, the term "worldly" is often used to describe attitudes or behaviors that prioritize material possessions, status, or pleasure over spiritual values and principles. It can also refer to an excessive focus on secular concerns rather than on matters of faith and morality.

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the term "worldly" from a Christian perspective, highlighting the negative connotations associated with worldly values such as selfishness, corruption, and ungodliness. However, it lacks in emphasizing the importance of the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, which is a key aspect in understanding how Christians should navigate their beliefs in the world. Encouraging further elaboration on this contrast would strengthen the response.
