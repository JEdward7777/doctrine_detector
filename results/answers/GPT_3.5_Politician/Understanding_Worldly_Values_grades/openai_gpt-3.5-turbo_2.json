  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response accurately defines the term \"worldly\" from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the negative connotations associated with worldly values. However, it lacks depth in explaining the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, which is a key aspect in understanding this concept fully within a Christian worldview. More elaboration on how godly principles, such as humility, compassion, and faith, contrast with the worldly values mentioned would strengthen the response."
