However, to enhance doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective, the answer could further emphasize that in Christianity, worship also involves acknowledging God's sovereignty, seeking His presence, and aligning one's life with His will. Additionally, mentioning the importance of worship as a response to God's love and salvation through Jesus Christ would strengthen the overall explanation."
