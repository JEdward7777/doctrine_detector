However, it lacks depth and misses key theological aspects tied to the term in Christian doctrine. The response could be improved by delving into biblical references that connect the term to prophecies, salvation, and the coming of the Messiah. Additionally, a Christian worldview would emphasize the fulfillment of promises and the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ in relation to the term \"Daughter of Zion.\""
