  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the metaphorical language used in Scripture, specifically the term \"Daughter of Zion\". It correctly identifies the term as a figurative expression referring to the people of Israel and highlights God's affection and care for them. The response also shows an awareness of the cultural and religious significance of this term, recognizing its importance in Jewish and Christian contexts.\n\nTo reach 100%, the response could have explored more deeply the implications of this metaphorical language for our understanding of God's relationship with His people. For example, how does this term reveal God's tender care and protection for Israel? How does it reflect His desire to be in a intimate and covenantal relationship with them?\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical metaphorical language and its significance for our understanding of God's relationship with His people."
