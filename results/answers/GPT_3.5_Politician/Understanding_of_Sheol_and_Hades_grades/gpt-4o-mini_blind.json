  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student's response provides a general overview of Sheol and Hades, but lacks doctrinal depth and clarity. The answer is somewhat accurate in mentioning Sheol as a neutral place and Hades as a place of punishment, but it could have delved deeper into the biblical references and significance of these concepts. Additionally, the response is somewhat vague and lacks a clear Christian perspective on the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. More clarity and specificity grounded in biblical teachings would have improved the answer."
