However, the answer lacks a clear distinction between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous in relation to Sheol and Hades, which is a key concern of the question. The response could be improved by focusing more on the specific biblical perspectives on the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous within the context of Sheol and Hades."
