  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The provided response gives a clear and concise explanation of the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death from a Christian perspective. The response effectively builds upon the initial answer provided, offering additional insight from the New Testament perspective. It demonstrates a good understanding of the concern and interprets it through a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific references to relevant biblical verses that support the explanation given."
