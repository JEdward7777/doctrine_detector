Comment: The answer provides a basic understanding of why Jesus Christ is referred to as the "cornerstone" in the context of the Assembly of believers. It correctly mentions the foundational role of Jesus in the Christian faith. However, the answer could be strengthened by emphasizing the doctrinal significance of Jesus as the cornerstone based on biblical passages such as Ephesians 2:20 and 1 Peter 2:6, highlighting how Jesus is the unifying and essential stone upon which the entire structure of faith stands. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to mention Jesus' role in unifying believers and serving as the ultimate authority in the Assembly. The answer could also have elaborated more on the implications of Jesus as the cornerstone in shaping Christian beliefs and practices.
