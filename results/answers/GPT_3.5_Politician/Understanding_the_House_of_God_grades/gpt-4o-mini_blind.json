However, it is important to emphasize the specific biblical understanding that the true \"house of God\" is the body of believers, as mentioned in passages like 1 Corinthians 3:16. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the biblical significance of the term and its Old Testament roots, such as the tabernacle and temple as dwelling places for God's presence among His people. Incorporating more scriptural references and theological insights would have strengthened the answer."
