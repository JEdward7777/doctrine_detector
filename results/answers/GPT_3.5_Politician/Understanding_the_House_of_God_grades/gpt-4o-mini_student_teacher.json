  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid answer by highlighting that the term \"house of God\" in a biblical context can refer to a physical building for worship and also symbolize the spiritual presence of God in believers. However, the reference answer is more focused and specific in defining the term as relating to the tabernacle or temple, which the student did not explicitly include. The student's recognition of differing interpretations across religious traditions is commendable, but a bit more precision in aligning with the teacher's response would have improved the grade further."
