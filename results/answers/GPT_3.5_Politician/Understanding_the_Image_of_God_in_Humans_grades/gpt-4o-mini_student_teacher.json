However, the answer lacks a direct connection to the specific characteristics mentioned in the reference answer regarding the image of God. To deepen the understanding of being created in the image of God, it is essential to explicitly mention characteristics such as the ability to feel emotion, reason, communicate, and the eternal spirit, as highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the biblical definition and draw connections to the given characteristics would strengthen their response."
