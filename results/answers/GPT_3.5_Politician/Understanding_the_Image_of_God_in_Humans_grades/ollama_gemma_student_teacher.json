  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer thoughtfully acknowledges the diversity of interpretations within religious communities and avoids making blanket statements about biblical interpretations. They correctly identify several characteristics associated with the image of God, such as love, compassion, forgiveness, and empathy. Additionally, the student demonstrates an awareness of ethical behavior and moral reasoning. However, the answer would benefit from a more direct connection to the provided reference answer by elaborating on the listed characteristics and their connection to the eternal spirit or emotional/communicative abilities mentioned in the reference."
