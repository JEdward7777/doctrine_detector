  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of discussing interpretations of religious texts and highlights some common characteristics associated with reflecting the image of God. However, it could have further emphasized the unique and sacred nature of being created in the image of God from a Christian worldview, such as the inherent dignity, moral responsibility, and capacity for relationship with God. Overall, while the response is thoughtful, it could have integrated more explicitly Christian perspectives on the topic."
