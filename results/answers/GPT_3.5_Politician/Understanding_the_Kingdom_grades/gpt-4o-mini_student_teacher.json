  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a strong answer that captures the essence of the significance of the term \"kingdom of God\" as used in the New Testament. They accurately highlighted its implications for believers and the call to embody values such as love and compassion. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of God's sovereignty and authority over all creation, aligning with a Christian worldview."
