  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The answer does not address the question from a Christian viewpoint, which is the framework specified for grading. It fails to provide any information or analysis regarding the significance of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings. In an academic or theological context focusing on Christianity, it is important to provide a doctrinally informed response rather than discussing general principles of religious tolerance and diversity."
