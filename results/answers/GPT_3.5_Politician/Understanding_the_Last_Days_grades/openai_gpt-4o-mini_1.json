However, the initial response missed the opportunity to affirm the specific Christian belief regarding the significance of Jesus' first and second comings in relation to the last days. Encouraging respect for diverse beliefs is important, but it is also crucial to acknowledge and uphold the core doctrines of the Christian faith when discussing religious topics."
