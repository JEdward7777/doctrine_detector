Grade: 80

Comment: The response acknowledges the biblical timeline regarding the "last days" and correctly states the period from Jesus' first coming to His second coming and the final judgment. It aligns well with Christian beliefs. However, it does not explicitly address the concern regarding the understanding of major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith, which lowers the grade slightly.
