However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing more on the theological significance of the name in terms of God's self-revelation and His covenantal relationship with Israel. Additionally, there was a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the historical and cultural significance of the name 'Yahweh' within the Old Testament context."
