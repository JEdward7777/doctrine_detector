  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a good explanation of the significance of the name 'Yahweh' in the Old Testament, connecting it to the divine presence, power, and authority in the lives of believers. However, the student could have delved deeper into how the name 'Yahweh' reflects God's personal relationship with humanity, as highlighted in the concern. A more explicit link to the personal nature of God and His relationship with humanity would have enhanced the answer further."
