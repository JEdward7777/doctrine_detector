It acknowledges the connection to the Hebrew verb meaning 'to be,' highlighting God's existence and presence. The focus on God's personal name and the emphasis on His relationship with believers align well with the concern provided. The only area for improvement would be to potentially elaborate further on how this personal name signifies the unique bond between God and His chosen people in the Old Testament."
