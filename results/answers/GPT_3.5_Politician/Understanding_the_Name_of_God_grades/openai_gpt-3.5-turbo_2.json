It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the connection between the name 'Yahweh' and God's relationship with humanity. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention the relational aspect of God's covenant with His chosen people in the Old Testament, which further emphasizes the personal nature of God."
