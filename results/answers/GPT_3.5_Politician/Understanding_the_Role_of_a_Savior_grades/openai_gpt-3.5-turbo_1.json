However, the response could have further emphasized the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation by explicitly connecting the temporary salvation provided by the Old Testament judges to the eternal salvation offered by Jesus Christ, demonstrating a clearer understanding of the overall narrative arc of salvation in the Bible."
