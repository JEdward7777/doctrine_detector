  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the Old Testament judges and Jesus Christ as saviors, but it does not fully address the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation. The student should have elaborated more on how the Old Testament judges foreshadowed Jesus as the ultimate Savior and provided a more thorough explanation of how salvation is presented throughout the Bible. The response also lacks a clear connection to the concern provided."
