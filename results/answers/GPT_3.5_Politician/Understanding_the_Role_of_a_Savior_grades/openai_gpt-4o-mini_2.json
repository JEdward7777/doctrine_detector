However, the connection between the Old Testament judges and Jesus Christ could have been further elaborated upon to deepen the understanding of how salvation is fulfilled in Christ. The response could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the Old Testament judges prefigure and point to the ultimate salvation found in Jesus Christ."
