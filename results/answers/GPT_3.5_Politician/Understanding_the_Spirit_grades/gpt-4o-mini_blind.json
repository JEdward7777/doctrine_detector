However, it lacks depth in explaining the biblical foundation for these concepts. Additionally, it could have included references to specific Scriptures that elaborate on the nature and characteristics of human spirit and evil spirits. The mention of respecting diverse beliefs and interpretations, though well-intentioned, is somewhat vague in the context of a Christian-specific worldview. More emphasis on biblical teachings and doctrinal clarity would have improved the response."
