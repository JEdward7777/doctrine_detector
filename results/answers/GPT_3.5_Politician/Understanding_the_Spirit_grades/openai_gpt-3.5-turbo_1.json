  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear distinction between personal spiritual identity and malevolent spiritual influences as requested. It accurately summarizes the concepts of human spirit and evil spirits in a Christian worldview. However, it could have included more specific references from the Bible to support the explanation for a more thorough analysis. Overall, a solid response that addresses the concern effectively."
