85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 85.

While the response provides some accurate information about the tabernacle's role in Israelite worship, it doesn't fully address the concern of understanding its significance in their relationship with God. The answer is more focused on the tabernacle as a physical structure rather than its spiritual implications.

The response does touch on the idea that the tabernacle provided a sacred space for religious rituals and practices, but it could delve deeper into how this sacred space facilitated connection with the divine. Additionally, the original answer provides some valuable context by highlighting God's role in the construction of the tabernacle, which could have been explored further to better understand its importance in Israelite worship.

To improve this response, I would suggest expanding on how the tabernacle enabled the Israelites to experience and express their faith in God, as well as exploring its symbolism and significance in their relationship with Him.
