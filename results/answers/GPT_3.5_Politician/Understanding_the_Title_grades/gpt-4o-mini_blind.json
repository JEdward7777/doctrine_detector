  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer an 70.\n\nWhile the answer provides a general overview of the interpretation of the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus' identity, it lacks doctrinal clarity. The answer does not explicitly mention the biblical origins of the title from the book of Daniel, nor does it emphasize the significance of Jesus using this title in reference to his Messianic role. A stronger emphasis on the divinity of Jesus and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies would improve the response. Additionally, the last sentence about approaching the topic with sensitivity and openness to diverse perspectives is good but should not overshadow the importance of understanding the core Christian beliefs related to this title."
