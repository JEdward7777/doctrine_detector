  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a good overview of the various interpretations of the title 'Son of Man' used by Jesus but falls short in explicitly acknowledging Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is crucial in understanding the significance of this title in the context of Jesus' identity from a Christian worldview. The student does mention the differing perspectives but lacks a clear assertion of the central Christian view on this matter."
