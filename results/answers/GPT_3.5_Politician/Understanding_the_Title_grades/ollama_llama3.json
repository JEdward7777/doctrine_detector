  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response provides some relevant information about the \"Son of Man\" title, including its connection to Jesus' humanity and divinity. It also acknowledges that different interpretations exist among scholars and theologians. However, the response falls short in fully exploring the implications of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" for our faith.\n\nThe concern is not fully addressed because the response does not delve deeper into what this title reveals about Jesus' nature, mission, and authority. Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific biblical references to support its claims.\n\nComment: The grade of 80 reflects the response's partial engagement with the concern and its limited exploration of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\". To improve, the response should provide more biblical evidence and explore the implications of this title for our faith in a more thorough manner."
