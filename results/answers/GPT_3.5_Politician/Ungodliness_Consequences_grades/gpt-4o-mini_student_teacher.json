  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely avoids addressing the question about the consequences for ungodly people according to God's pronouncements. Instead, the student focuses on promoting interfaith understanding and inclusivity, which are important but not relevant to the given question from a Christian perspective. The student's answer lacks any engagement with the Christian worldview and does not address the concern about the spiritual ramifications of living in disobedience to God."
