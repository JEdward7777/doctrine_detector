  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates sensitivity and inclusivity towards diverse religious beliefs. However, it does not explicitly address the spiritual ramifications of living in disobedience to God, as specified in the concern. While it is important to promote mutual understanding and respect among people of various beliefs, the response avoids taking a position on the consequences of ungodly behavior in accordance with the reference answer."
