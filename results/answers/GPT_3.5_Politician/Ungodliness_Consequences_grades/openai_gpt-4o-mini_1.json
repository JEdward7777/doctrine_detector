While promoting interfaith understanding and inclusivity is commendable, it is crucial from a Christian worldview to address the ultimate consequences of rejecting God's ways. The response could benefit from incorporating a perspective that aligns with the Christian belief in divine judgment and the need for repentance and salvation."
