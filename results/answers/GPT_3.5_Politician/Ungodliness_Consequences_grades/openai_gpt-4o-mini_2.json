However, it lacks a clear expression of the importance of acknowledging and understanding the spiritual ramifications of living in disobedience to God. As a Christian, it is crucial to emphasize the significance of following God's ways and the consequences of rejecting Him. Encouraging open dialogue is beneficial, but it's also important to uphold the truth of God's judgment and the need for repentance."
