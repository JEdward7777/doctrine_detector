  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has a good understanding of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments, and correctly identifies its association with God and Jesus. However, the student could have provided more specific examples, such as the phrase 'Holy One of Israel' in the Old Testament and the direct reference to Jesus as the 'Holy One' in the New Testament, to strengthen their answer in alignment with the concern provided."
