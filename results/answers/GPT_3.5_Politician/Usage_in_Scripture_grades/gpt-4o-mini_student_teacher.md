## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [GPT 3.5 Politician](../../../answering_models/GPT_3.5_Politician.md)
The term "Holy One" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to refer to God or a divine being who is set apart and sacred. In the Old Testament, it is often used to describe God's holiness and righteousness. In the New Testament, it is used to refer to Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity. The term is considered a reverent and respectful way to address God or Jesus in Christian theology.
