In the Old Testament, it is often used to describe God's holiness and righteousness. In the New Testament, it is used to refer to Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity. The term is considered a reverent and respectful way to address God or Jesus in Christian theology.

## Grade: 80

**Comment:** The student's answer provides a concise and accurate overview of the usage of the term "Holy One" in both the Old and New Testaments. It correctly highlights the fundamental significance of the term as representing God's holiness and righteousness in the Old Testament and its specific reference to Jesus Christ in the New Testament. However, including the specific citation of the Old Testament phrase "Holy One of Israel" and the New Testament reference to Jesus as the "Holy One" would have elevated the grade further.
