It also accurately highlights the specific phrase \"Holy One of Israel\" in the Old Testament and the direct reference to Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament. However, the response could have delved deeper into exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which was the primary concern. While it mentions Jesus' identity as the Son of God and Savior, a more nuanced analysis of His divine nature and authority would have strengthened the response. Nevertheless, the response provides a solid foundation for further exploration of this topic."
