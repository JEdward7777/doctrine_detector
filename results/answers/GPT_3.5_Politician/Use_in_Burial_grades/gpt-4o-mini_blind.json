  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer a 90. The student accurately describes how myrrh was used in biblical times in the context of burial practices.

The only thing missing to make this answer more complete would be to mention that myrrh was one of the gifts brought to Jesus by the Magi, highlighting its significance in Christian tradition as well."
