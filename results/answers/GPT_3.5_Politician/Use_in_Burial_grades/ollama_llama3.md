I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response effectively answers the given question, providing relevant information about the use of myrrh in ancient burial practices. It also shows an understanding of the cultural significance of myrrh's use, highlighting its importance in the "anointing process" and the respect it showed to the deceased.

Regarding the concern that the grade addresses, the response demonstrates a good comprehension of cultural contexts surrounding burial practices in biblical times.
