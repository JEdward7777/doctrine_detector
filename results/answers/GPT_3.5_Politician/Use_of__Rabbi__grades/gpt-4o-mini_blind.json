  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70. While the student accurately acknowledges that John the Baptist and Jesus were both referred to as \"Rabbi\" by their followers, they missed an important distinction. In Christian theology, Jesus holds a unique and higher authority than a traditional Rabbi. Jesus is often referred to as Rabbi by his followers, but his role goes beyond that of a teacher in Jewish society. The response could have been improved by emphasizing the divine nature of Jesus and the significance of his teachings in the Christian faith."
