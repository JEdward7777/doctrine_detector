  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response partially acknowledges the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings, stating that they were referred to as \"Rabbi\" by their followers and those who recognized their teachings and authority in Jewish society. This shows an appreciation for the cultural significance of these titles in their time.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly recognizing the reverence and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The answer provided does not go beyond simply stating that they were called \"Rabbi\", whereas the concern asks us to consider the respect and authority associated with their teachings.\n\nThe comment: \"This response partially acknowledges the significance of the titles 'Rabbi' in Jewish society, but could benefit from a more explicit recognition of the reverence and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings.\""
