Comment: The response effectively acknowledges that both John the Baptist and Jesus were addressed as "Rabbi" by their followers, highlighting their roles as teachers. It shows an understanding of the respect and authority associated with their teachings. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique and divine authority of Jesus as the Son of God, in contrast to John the Baptist.
