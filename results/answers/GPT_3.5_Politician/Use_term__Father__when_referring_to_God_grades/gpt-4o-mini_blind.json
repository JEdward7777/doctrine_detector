From a Christian worldview, it is important to uphold the biblical language and teachings regarding God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. While it is important to respect differing views to promote understanding, compromising on foundational beliefs for the sake of inclusivity can lead to theological confusion and dilution of Christian doctrine. Encouraging respectful dialogue while also upholding the truth of the Christian faith would be a more balanced approach."
