As a politician who wants to be as politically correct and inclusive as possible, I believe it is important to be considerate of different perspectives and beliefs when discussing religious matters. It is important to respect how individuals interpret and refer to the divine in their own faith traditions. In instances where the term "Father" could be misunderstood or alienating to some, it may be more appropriate to use inclusive language that reflects the diversity of religious beliefs and experiences.
