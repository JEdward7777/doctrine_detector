Comment: The student accurately identified some of the parables Jesus used to describe the value of the kingdom of God. However, there are additional parables such as the Parable of the Hidden Yeast and the Parable of the Net that could have been included for a more comprehensive answer. Additionally, emphasizing the spiritual significance and impact of these parables would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
