  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of parables that Jesus used to describe the value of the kingdom of God. However, the student missed mentioning the Parable of the Yeast and didn't elaborate on the transformative power of the kingdom of God as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
