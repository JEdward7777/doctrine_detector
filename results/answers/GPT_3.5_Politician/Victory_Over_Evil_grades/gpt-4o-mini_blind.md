Grade: 20

Comment: The response completely avoids addressing the question from a Christian perspective. In a Christian worldview, the promise regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan is rooted in biblical teachings, particularly in passages like Revelation 20:10 which speaks of Satan's ultimate defeat and destruction. It is important for the student to demonstrate an understanding of Christian beliefs and provide an answer within that framework.
