**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 
The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of respecting diverse religious beliefs. However, it lacks specific reference to the promise of God regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan, as outlined in the reference answer. To improve, the response should explicitly address the biblical promise related to the Messiah's victory over Satan.
