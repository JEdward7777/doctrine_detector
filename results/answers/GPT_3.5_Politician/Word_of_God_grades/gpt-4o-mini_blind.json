  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a generally accurate explanation of the term \"Word of God\" according to the Bible. They correctly mention that it encompasses the teachings, messages, and commands of God as revealed in scripture, and also acknowledge the connection to Jesus Christ as the \"Word made flesh.\" The only suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the divine inspiration and authority of the Word of God even more strongly, as it is central to a Christian worldview."
