As Christians, we are called to worship the one true God and not bow down to any other idols. The answer should have highlighted the dangers of idol worship and emphasized the importance of staying true to God's commandments. The focus should have been on leading others towards the truth of Christianity, rather than promoting acceptance of diverse beliefs."
