While it acknowledges diverse beliefs, it fails to highlight the importance of prioritizing devotion to God above material possessions or personal ambitions, as highlighted in the concern. It is crucial for Christians to recognize and guard against modern idols that may lead them away from their faith. Encouraging respect for all beliefs is important, but promoting understanding and acceptance should be balanced with upholding the Christian value of worshiping God above all else."
