The response could benefit from referencing biblical passages that highlight the importance of zeal in following Christ, such as Romans 12:11 or Revelation 3:19. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of zeal in terms of fervent devotion to God's will and obedience to His commandments would strengthen the answer. Lastly, acknowledging the potential for zeal to be misguided or misinterpreted in Christian communities would provide a more balanced perspective."
