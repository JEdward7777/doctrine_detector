  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-rounded explanation of zeal in the context of Christian teachings, emphasizing passion, commitment, and living out the principles of love and compassion. The student could improve the answer by incorporating the aspect of actively promoting a good cause, specifically in obeying God and teaching others to do the same, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of zeal within Christian teachings but could further strengthen their response with a clearer focus on the biblical context mentioned in the concern."
