The response acknowledges the central role of zeal in promoting a good cause in obedience to God. However, there could be a deeper exploration of the biblical context of zeal to enhance the understanding of how it should be applied in a believer's life. A more thorough examination of specific biblical references related to zeal would have strengthened the response further."
