Mount Zion is historically significant for its association with King David, who claimed it as his residence after capturing the city of Jerusalem. It served as the political and religious center of the Israelite kingdom under David's reign and is considered a symbol of unity and strength for the Jewish people.

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the historical significance of Mount Zion in relation to King David from a Christian-specific worldview. It correctly points out David's capture of the stronghold and subsequent establishment of Jerusalem as his capital. The emphasis on Mount Zion as a symbol of unity and strength for the Jewish people aligns with the biblical narrative and Christian understanding of the significance of the location. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the religious significance of Mount Zion beyond its political and territorial importance.
