It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of Mount Zion in the biblical narrative and its connection to key figures in Scripture. The response could be further enhanced by providing more specific examples of how Mount Zion's association with King David and Jerusalem impacts Christian beliefs and practices."
