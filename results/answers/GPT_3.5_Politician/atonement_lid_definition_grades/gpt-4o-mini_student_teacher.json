However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing more on God's mercy in redeeming sinful human beings and the role of the high priest in mediating on behalf of the people before Yahweh. Adding those elements would have aligned the response more closely with the Christian worldview emphasis on God's initiative in offering forgiveness and reconciliation through the atonement lid."
