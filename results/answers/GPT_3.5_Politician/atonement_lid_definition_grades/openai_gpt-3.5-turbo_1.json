It effectively addresses the concern regarding the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament from a Christian worldview. However, it could have been enhanced by incorporating more detail about the significance of sacrifices in the atonement process and the ultimate fulfillment of atonement through Jesus Christ in the New Testament."
