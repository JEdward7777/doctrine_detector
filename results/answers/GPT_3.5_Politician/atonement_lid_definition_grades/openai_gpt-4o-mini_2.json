The answer effectively demonstrates an understanding of the Old Testament's symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement. The mention of God's redemption of sinful human beings aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness through God's mercy. Great job!"
