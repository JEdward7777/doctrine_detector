  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and comprehensive answer with various interpretations of the 'abomination of desolation' mentioned in Matthew 24:15. However, the student missed the key Christian perspective and understanding that this event signifies a rebellion against God and defilement of His sacred space, as referenced in the teacher's answer. The focus on different interpretations from scholars and theologians, while insightful, lacked the foundational Christian worldview necessary to fully address the significance of this prophetic warning. Hence, the grade is lower to emphasize the importance of aligning theological interpretations with key Christian teachings."
