  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of interpretations of the 'abomination of desolation' with a solid biblical context and consideration of different Christian perspectives. The connection to defiling God's sacred spaces and understanding prophetic warnings is appropriately addressed. The only improvement could be a bit more emphasis on the specific concern raised in the grading scenario to fully align the response with a Christian worldview."
