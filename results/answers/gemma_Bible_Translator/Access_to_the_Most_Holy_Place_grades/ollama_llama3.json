  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account and its significance, particularly in recognizing the importance of purity and holiness in approaching God's presence. The writer correctly highlights the separation between God and humanity and the need for intermediaries like priests to facilitate communication with God. However, there is room for improvement in terms of depth and nuance.\n\nSome areas where the response could be strengthened include:\n\n1. More detailed analysis: While the response provides a good overview of the biblical account, it would benefit from more detailed analysis of the underlying theological principles.\n2. Better integration: The writer could integrate the various ideas presented more smoothly, creating a more cohesive and compelling argument.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the writer could expand on the significance of the restrictions on access to the most holy place, exploring how these limitations reflect God's holiness and humanity's fallen state."
