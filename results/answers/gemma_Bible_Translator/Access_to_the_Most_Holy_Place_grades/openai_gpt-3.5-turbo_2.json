It effectively addresses the concern regarding recognizing the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him, grounding the discussion in Christian theological principles. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the role of the high priest as the mediator between God and the people in the theological interpretation."
