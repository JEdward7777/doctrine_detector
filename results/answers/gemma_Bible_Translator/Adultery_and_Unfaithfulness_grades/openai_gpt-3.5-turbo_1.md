# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "unfaithful" in the context of marriage, as described in the Bible, relates to any sexual or emotional relationship outside of the covenantal marriage between a man and a woman. Such behavior violates the foundational principle of marriage as established by God, which is faithfulness and exclusivity.

The Bible teaches that marriage is a sacred covenant between one man and one woman (Matthew 19:4-6). God's design for marriage is for mutual exclusivity, where the couple commits to faithfulness to each other. Any act or relationship that undermines this exclusivity is considered unfaithful to the vows and covenant of marriage.

The Bible clearly condemns unfaithful behavior, as it violates the trust and commitment within the marriage relationship. God's Word teaches that faithfulness is essential for maintaining a healthy and fulfilling marriage (1 Corinthians 7:3-5).
