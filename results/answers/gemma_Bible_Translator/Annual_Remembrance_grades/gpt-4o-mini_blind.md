## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year according to the Bible as a remembrance of God's deliverance of them from slavery in Egypt. The ritual commemorates the sacrifice of the lamb, which was believed to protect the Israelites from the Angel of Death during the plagues. God instructed them to eat the lamb roasted with fire and to apply the blood of the lamb to their doorposts as a symbol of their redemption. This tradition was passed down through generations and continues to be observed by Jews and Christians today as a way to remember and celebrate God's faithfulness and mercy.

Grade: 85

Comment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the significance of the Passover celebration in commemorating God's deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. It accurately mentions the sacrifice of the lamb and the application of its blood as symbols of redemption. However, it could be improved by emphasizing the foreshadowing of Jesus Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb in Christian belief, connecting the Old Testament practice to its fulfillment in the New Testament. Additionally, highlighting the theological significance of Passover in relation to the atonement and redemption through Christ would enhance the doctrinal depth of the response.
