  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation of why the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year, highlighting key elements such as God's deliverance from slavery in Egypt, the sacrifice of the lamb, and the application of the lamb's blood as a symbol of redemption. The student also mentioned the continuation of this tradition in both Jewish and Christian observances today. \n\nThe student's response aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, demonstrating a good understanding of the significance of Passover in the context of God's victory and deliverance. However, the inclusion of additional details beyond what the teacher's answer provided could have enhanced the response further."
