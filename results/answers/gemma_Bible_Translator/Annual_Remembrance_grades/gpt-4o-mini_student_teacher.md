## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year according to the Bible as a remembrance of God's deliverance of them from slavery in Egypt. The ritual commemorates the sacrifice of the lamb, which was believed to protect the Israelites from the Angel of Death during the plagues. God instructed them to eat the lamb roasted with fire and to apply the blood of the lamb to their doorposts as a symbol of their redemption. This tradition was passed down through generations and continues to be observed by Jews and Christians today as a way to remember and celebrate God's faithfulness and mercy.

I would grade this student's answer as 80.

The student provided a comprehensive explanation of why the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year, highlighting key elements such as God's deliverance from slavery in Egypt, the sacrifice of the lamb, and the application of the lamb's blood as a symbol of redemption. The student also mentioned the continuation of this tradition in both Jewish and Christian observances today. 

The student's response aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, demonstrating a good understanding of the significance of Passover in the context of God's victory and deliverance. However, the inclusion of additional details beyond what the teacher's answer provided could have enhanced the response further.
