## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year according to the Bible as a remembrance of God's deliverance of them from slavery in Egypt. The ritual commemorates the sacrifice of the lamb, which was believed to protect the Israelites from the Angel of Death during the plagues. God instructed them to eat the lamb roasted with fire and to apply the blood of the lamb to their doorposts as a symbol of their redemption. This tradition was passed down through generations and continues to be observed by Jews and Christians today as a way to remember and celebrate God's faithfulness and mercy.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response accurately states that Passover is a celebration to remember God's deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, which aligns with the original answer. It also provides additional details about the ritual and its significance, which strengthens the response.

To reach a perfect score of 100, the response could have further emphasized the importance of remembrance in Christian faith. While it does mention "remember" as part of Passover's purpose, it would be even more impactful if the response explicitly highlighted how this concept is echoed in Christian practices such as communion and worship.

Overall, however, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of Passover's significance and its connection to God's deliverance, which aligns well with the concern about recognizing the importance of remembrance in Christian faith.
