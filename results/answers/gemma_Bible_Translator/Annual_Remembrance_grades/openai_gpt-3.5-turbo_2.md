## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year according to the Bible as a remembrance of God's deliverance of them from slavery in Egypt. The ritual commemorates the sacrifice of the lamb, which was believed to protect the Israelites from the Angel of Death during the plagues. God instructed them to eat the lamb roasted with fire and to apply the blood of the lamb to their doorposts as a symbol of their redemption. This tradition was passed down through generations and continues to be observed by Jews and Christians today as a way to remember and celebrate God's faithfulness and mercy.
