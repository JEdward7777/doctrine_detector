It highlights the key elements of the Passover ritual and connects it to God's faithfulness and mercy. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the importance of remembrance in Passover to the broader Christian faith tradition, such as how it foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ."
