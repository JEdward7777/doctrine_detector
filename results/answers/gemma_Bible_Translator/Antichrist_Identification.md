**1. Denial of Jesus Christ:**

* The antichrist will deny the deity and personhood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God (2 John 1:9-10).
* He will oppose and blaspheme the Son of God (1 John 2:22).

**2. Love for lies:**

* The antichrist will speak lies and deceive people (1 John 2:24).
* He will oppose the truth and promote his own false doctrines (2 John 7).

**3. Rejection of God's Law:**

* The antichrist will reject God's law and commandments (2 John 9).
* He will claim to be above the law or redefine it according to his own will (1 John 3:4).

**4. Exaltation of self:**

* The antichrist will exalt himself above others, claiming to be the ultimate authority (1 John 2:23).
* He will seek power and control over others (2 John 6).

**5. Opposition to God's people:**

* The antichrist will oppose and persecute God's people (2 John 10).
* He will seek to destroy the faith of believers (1 John 2:19).

These characteristics are clear indicators of someone who opposes and rejects the foundational truths of Christianity.
