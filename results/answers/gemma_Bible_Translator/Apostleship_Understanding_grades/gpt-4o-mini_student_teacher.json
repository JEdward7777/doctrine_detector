  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the gospel. They covered various aspects such as authorship, apostolic mandate, witnessing power, establishing the Church, preservation of the faith, continuity of the Gospel, global expansion, and divine appointment. While the student's response is thorough and insightful, it could be more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern of understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission, which is the main emphasis of the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic."
