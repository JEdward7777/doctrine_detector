It effectively addresses the concern of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission by highlighting key aspects such as authorship, apostolic mandate, witnessing power, establishing the Church, preservation of the faith, continuity of the gospel, global expansion, and divine appointment. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a more direct mention of the Great Commission itself from Matthew 28:19-20 to strengthen the connection between the apostles' mission and Jesus' command. Overall, a thorough and well-supported response."
