  "grade_comment": "The student\u2019s response is accurate and aligns with Christian teachings. They correctly identify Michael as the only angel referred to as an 'archangel' in the Bible. The statement that this title signifies his high rank and authority also reflects the traditional understanding of the term. Therefore, I would grade this answer as 100. Great job!"
