Grade: 60

Comment: The student correctly identifies that the Ark of the Covenant was not initially located in the tabernacle, but their explanation is a bit lacking in detail. They should have mentioned that the Ark was eventually placed in the Most Holy Place within the tabernacle in the wilderness and later in the temple in Jerusalem. Additionally, they could have provided more information on the significance of the Ark within the context of Israelite worship and the presence of God.
