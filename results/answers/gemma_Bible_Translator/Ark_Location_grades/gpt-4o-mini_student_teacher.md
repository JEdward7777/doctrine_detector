Comment: The student's response correctly identifies the location of the Ark of the Covenant as not being in the tabernacle but fails to mention its significance in relation to the most holy place and the presence of God. The student would benefit from further studying the importance of the Ark of the Covenant in the context of God's presence and the most holy place within the tabernacle.
