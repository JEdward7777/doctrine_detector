  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer correctly states that the Ark of the Covenant is not explicitly mentioned in the tabernacle in the Bible. However, it could have elaborated on the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God, as per the given concern. The response lacks elaboration on the symbolic or theological significance of the ark's location in the tabernacle within a Christian worldview."
