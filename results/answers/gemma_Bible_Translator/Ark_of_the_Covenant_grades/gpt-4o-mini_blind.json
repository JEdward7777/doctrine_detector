They correctly mention its representation of God's presence, mediation of blessings, and protection. However, there are a few theological inaccuracies. The Ark was not placed in the water during the flood; it was Noah's Ark that floated on the water. Additionally, the Ark of the Covenant was not constructed as a fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham and Moses; its construction was commanded to Moses by God. The student could improve the accuracy and depth of their explanation by addressing these points."
