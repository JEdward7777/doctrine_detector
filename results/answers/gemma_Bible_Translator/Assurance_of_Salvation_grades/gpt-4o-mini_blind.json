  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation of the assurance given to those who believe in Jesus, grounded in Scripture. The student effectively explains the foundational truths of God's promise and Jesus' sacrifice, leading to the assurance of forgiveness, eternal life, and belonging to God. The inclusion of additional verses and encouragements from the Bible reinforces the message of assurance in God's Word. The emphasis on faith as a gift from God and the importance of relying on God's promises rather than feelings or experiences is well-stated. Overall, a strong and edifying response."
