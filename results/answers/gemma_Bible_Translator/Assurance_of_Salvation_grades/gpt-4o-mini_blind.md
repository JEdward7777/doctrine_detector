## [Answer](../Assurance_of_Salvation.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The assurance given to those who believe in Jesus is rooted in God's Word and rests on two foundational truths:**

**1. God's Promise:**

* God promised eternal life to all who believe in Jesus (John 3:16, 3:36, 20:31).
* This promise is not based on our merit or anything we do, but solely on God's grace through Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9).

**2. Jesus' Sacrifice:**

* Jesus died on the cross as the perfect sacrifice for our sins (Hebrews 9:26).
* His sacrifice reconciled us to God, removing the barrier of sin and offering us forgiveness (Romans 5:1).

**Therefore, those who believe in Jesus:**

* Have their sins forgiven (1 John 1:9)
* Have eternal life (John 10:27-28)
* Are children of God (John 1:12)
* Are guaranteed a place in heaven (John 14:2-3)

**The Bible also provides encouragement and assurance to believers:**

* "I will never leave you nor forsake you" (Matthew 28:20)
* "You are not alone" (Mark 4:38)
* "My grace is sufficient for you" (2 Corinthians 12:9)

**Christians can find assurance in:**

* The authority of God's Word
* The power of Jesus' sacrifice
* The love of God for his children

**Remember:**

* Faith in Jesus is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:8).
* Assurance is not based on feelings or experiences, but on God's promises.
* The Christian life is a journey of faith and obedience, trusting in God's faithfulness and grace.
