Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the traits necessary to avoid hypocrisy in love and actions, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern about living out one's faith authentically as crucial in representing Christ's love in the world. Deduction was made due to the answer being more detailed than the reference answer, though still lacking the straightforwardness of the specific verse cited in Romans 12:9.
