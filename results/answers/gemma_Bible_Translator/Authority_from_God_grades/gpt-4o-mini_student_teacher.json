  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively explains the concept of divine authority and its significance for believers. They covered key aspects such as biblical authority, the impact on decision-making and community, and the importance of interpreting the Bible responsibly. The only minor point of improvement would be to align the definition of 'divine authority' more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
