  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a thorough overview of the Bible's teachings on the authority of governing rulers over their citizens. The student correctly emphasizes the concepts of divine ordination and submission to authority, supported by relevant biblical passages. The inclusion of key verses and explanations adds depth to the answer. The response could be further enhanced by distinguishing more clearly between blind obedience to rulers and the exceptions when civil disobedience may be necessary in light of Christian values."
