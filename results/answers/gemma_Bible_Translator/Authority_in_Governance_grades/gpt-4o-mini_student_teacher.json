  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that addresses the concern of divine ordination and submission to authority regarding governing rulers. The use of relevant Bible passages to support their points is commendable. However, the student included some additional perspectives that deviate from the reference answer provided by the teacher, which may slightly lower the grade. Overall, a good understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
