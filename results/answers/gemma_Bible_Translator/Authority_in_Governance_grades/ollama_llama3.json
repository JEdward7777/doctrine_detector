  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey by providing biblical evidence for the concept of divine ordination and submission to authority. The response clearly explains that governing rulers have been established by God and possess authority to govern and make laws, as suggested in Romans 13:1-2.\n\nThe added depth provided by discussing divine ordination and submission to authority shows a more nuanced understanding of the biblical teaching on government and authority. Additionally, the inclusion of relevant passages from the Bible helps to provide further support for the response's claims.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved with more explicit connections between the biblical teachings and modern-day implications or applications. While it is mentioned that the Bible teaches both divine ordination and submission to authority, a more detailed exploration of what this looks like in practice would strengthen the response.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of biblical teaching on government and authority, but could be further strengthened with additional application and implications for everyday life."
