  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive understanding of the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey based on the specified concern. It effectively integrates relevant biblical passages and principles to support the importance of submission to governing rulers. The explanation is clear, well-organized, and supported with appropriate references. The response could further strengthen its argument by explicitly addressing the concern throughout the entire analysis. Overall, a strong and well-rounded examination from a Christian worldview."
