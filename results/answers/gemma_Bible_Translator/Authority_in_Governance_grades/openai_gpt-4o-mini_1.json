  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively incorporates the theme of divine ordination of governing rulers from the provided answer and addresses the concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. It provides relevant scriptural references and explanations to support the viewpoint from a Christian worldview. The only improvement could be to further emphasize the importance of discerning between obedience to earthly authorities and adherence to fundamental Christian principles, but overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
