**The authority of the apostles is foundational to both their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly:**

**1. Apostolic Authority and Miracle-Performing:**

* The apostles had the authority of Christ himself to perform miracles (Mark 16:17).

* The ability to perform miracles was not an independent authority but flowed from their relationship with Jesus Christ.

**2. Apostolic Authority and Bold Preaching:**

* Their boldness stemmed from their deep conviction of the truthfulness of their message and their trust in God's protection.
* The authority they received from Christ gave them confidence to speak out against persecution and stand firm in their convictions.

**Interplay:**

* The authority of the apostles to perform miracles and preach boldly are interconnected.
