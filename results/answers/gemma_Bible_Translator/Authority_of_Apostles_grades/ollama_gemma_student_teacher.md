**The authority of the apostles is foundational to both their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly:**

**1. Apostolic Authority and Miracle-Performing:**

* The apostles had the authority of Christ himself to perform miracles (Mark 16:17). 
* Their miracles authenticated their authenticity as messengers of God and served as signs of God's power and sovereignty.
* The ability to perform miracles was not an independent authority but flowed from their relationship with Jesus Christ.

**2. Apostolic Authority and Bold Preaching:**

* The apostles were empowered by the Holy Spirit to preach the gospel fearlessly (Acts 4:29). 
* Their boldness stemmed from their deep conviction of the truthfulness of their message and their trust in God's protection.
* The authority they received from Christ gave them confidence to speak out against persecution and stand firm in their convictions.

**Interplay:**

* The authority of the apostles to perform miracles and preach boldly are interconnected. 
* Their ability to perform miracles enhanced their credibility and authenticity as messengers, enabling them to speak with greater authority. 
* Their bold preaching, fueled by the Holy Spirit, demonstrated the supernatural power backing their message.

**Biblical Support:**

* "He gave the apostles... the power to heal the sick, to deliver those oppressed by demons, and to proclaim the good news of peace through Jesus Christ" (Acts 1:8).
* "And when they had prayed, the Holy Spirit took control of them and they spoke the word of God fearlessly" (Acts 4:31).

**Conclusion:**

The authority of the apostles is essential to both their miraculous powers and their courageous preaching. These two aspects work together to authenticate their message and empower them to spread the gospel effectively.
