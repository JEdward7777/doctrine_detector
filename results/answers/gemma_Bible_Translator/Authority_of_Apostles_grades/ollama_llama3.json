The discussion of miracle-performing and bold preaching as interconnected aspects of the apostles' ministry is also well-presented.\n\nHowever, while the response provides a good overview of the apostles' authority and empowerment, it could be further developed by providing more specific biblical examples and illustrations to support its claims. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. With some refinement in these areas, the response would likely score higher.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* Clear exploration of the apostles' divine empowerment and authority for ministry\n* Good discussion of the interconnectedness of miracle-performing and bold preaching\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* Could benefit from more specific biblical examples and illustrations\n* Some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them hard to follow"
