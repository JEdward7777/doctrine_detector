  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the term 'Yahweh of hosts' and its significance in showcasing God's authority over spiritual beings. They offer relevant biblical references and effectively explain the implications of understanding God's authority. However, the teacher's reference answer provides a slightly more concise and focused explanation, which is why the grade is not perfect. Great effort overall."
