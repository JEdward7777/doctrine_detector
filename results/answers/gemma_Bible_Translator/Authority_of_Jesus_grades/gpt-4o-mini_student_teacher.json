  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of how the title \"King of the Jews\" illustrates Jesus' authority over all creation, touching on key aspects such as fulfillment of prophecy, dominion over creation, reconciliation of creation, universal lordship, and new creation. The inclusion of relevant biblical references and the explanation of Jesus' ultimate victory over sin and death adds depth to the answer. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern of understanding Jesus' authority to acknowledge His sovereignty in believers' lives, as outlined in the reference answer."
