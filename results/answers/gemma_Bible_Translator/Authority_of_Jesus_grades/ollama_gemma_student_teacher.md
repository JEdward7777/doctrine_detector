## Question [Authority of Jesus](../../../questions/Authority_of_Jesus.md)
In what ways does the title 'King of the Jews' illustrate Jesus' authority over all creation?

## Correct Answer
The title not only identifies Jesus as the ruler over the Jewish people but also emphasizes His authority as King over all creation, asserting His divine kingship.

## Stated Concern
Understanding Jesus' authority helps believers acknowledge His sovereignty in their lives.

## [Answer](../Authority_of_Jesus.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "King of the Jews" in the Bible reveals the profound authority Jesus exercises over all creation in several ways:

**1. Fulfillment of Prophecy:**

* The Old Testament prophesied that the Messiah would be a descendant of David and inherit the throne of Israel (Psalm 2:6-7, Isaiah 9:7).
* Jesus fulfills this prophecy by being both fully human and the Son of God (Hebrews 7:14).

**2. Dominion over Creation:**

* Throughout the Bible, God is depicted as the ultimate ruler and owner of everything (Psalm 103:1, Revelation 4:11).
* By inheriting the throne of David, Jesus inherits the authority delegated by God to humanity in Genesis 1:26-28. This authority includes dominion over all creation.

**3. Reconciliation of Creation:**

* Jesus' reign is not merely about political power or control. His primary purpose is to reconcile all things to God through his death and resurrection (Colossians 1:20).
* This reconciliation involves healing the brokenness of the world and restoring the harmonious relationship between God and creation.

**4. Universal Lordship:**

* In the book of Revelation, Jesus is described as the "Ruler of the kings of the earth" and the "Prince of princes" (Revelation 1:5, 19:16).
* This title emphasizes that Jesus' authority extends over all nations and peoples, and that his reign is ultimately universal.

**5. New Creation:**

* Jesus' kingdom is not just about restoring what was lost, but also about creating a new reality.
* Through his resurrection, Jesus becomes the firstborn from the dead (Colossians 1:18), symbolizing the dawn of a new creation where sin and suffering are overcome.

Therefore, the title "King of the Jews" reveals that Jesus' authority extends far beyond political power. It signifies his rightful dominion over all creation, his purpose to reconcile all things to God, and his ultimate victory over sin and death.
