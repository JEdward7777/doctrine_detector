  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and well-organized overview of key figures involved in writing the Psalms, backed up with biblical evidence and mentioning of scholarly debates. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the traditional attributions of the Psalms to different authors and their respective characteristics. However, a higher grade could be achieved by including more specific references to scripture to support the claims made about each author's contributions to the Psalms. Overall, a solid and informative response."
