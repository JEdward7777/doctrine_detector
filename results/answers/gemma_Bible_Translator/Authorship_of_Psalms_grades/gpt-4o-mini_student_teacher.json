  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of key figures involved in writing the Psalms, demonstrating a good understanding of the authorship of Psalms. However, the student missed mentioning Solomon as one of the key figures, which was included in the reference answer from the teacher. Despite this oversight, the student's response showed knowledge of biblical evidence, scholarly debate, and specific contributions of each figure mentioned."
