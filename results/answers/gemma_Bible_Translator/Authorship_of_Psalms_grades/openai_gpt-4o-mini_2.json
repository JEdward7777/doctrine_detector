It addresses the concern by emphasizing how recognizing the authorship of Psalms enhances understanding of their messages and themes. The inclusion of Biblical evidence and scholarly debate adds depth to the discussion. However, the original answer missed mentioning some key authors like Ethan the Ezrahite and Heman, which could have enriched the response further."
