The considerations and potential concerns raised are relevant and well-articulated. The suggestions for contextual translation, alternative expressions, and transparency are practical approaches to addressing the potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures. The conclusion effectively emphasizes the balance needed between truth and understanding in translation work. Overall, a solid response with room for further theological depth and exploration of biblical principles related to the terminology in question."
