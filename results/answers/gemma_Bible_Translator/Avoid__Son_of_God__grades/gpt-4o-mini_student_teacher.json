Although their suggestions align with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of teaching the meaning through context and explanation, the reference answer provided a more direct stance on not avoiding the term. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the issue at hand and provided well-reasoned solutions."
