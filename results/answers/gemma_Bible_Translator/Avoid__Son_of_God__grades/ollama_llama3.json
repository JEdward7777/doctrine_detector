  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe response directly addresses the concern about avoiding the term \"Son of God\" and provides thoughtful solutions to mitigate potential misunderstandings. It acknowledges that careful teaching through context and explanation can help clarify the meaning of the term, which aligns with the given answer. The response also highlights the importance of balancing truth and understanding in translation, which is a key consideration for effective communication.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or strategies for implementing contextual translations, alternative expressions, and transparency in the translation process. However, overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern and presents thoughtful solutions that take into account the importance of communicating theological truth accurately and effectively."
