- Represents God's judgment and cleansing power. 


**2. Sprinkling/Pouring:**

- Primarily seen in the Old Testament as a blessing for children. 
- Represents God's grace and blessing on the recipient.


**3. Full Immersion:**

- Primarily associated with New Testament baptism. 
- Represents washing away of sin and entering a new life in Christ.


**4. Washing with Water:**

- Mentioned in the New Testament as a symbol of physical cleansing and transformation. 


## Interpretations in Various Christian Contexts:

**1. Evangelical/Pentecostal:**
- Emphasis on believer's baptism by immersion as the only valid baptism.
- Seen as a visible representation of forgiveness of sins and initiation into Christian life.


**2. Roman Catholic:**
- Baptism by pouring is practiced for infants, while adult converts are immersed.
- Seen as an essential sacrament with forgiveness of sins and incorporation into the Church.


**3. Protestant Denominations:**
- Views on baptism vary, with some accepting immersion, others pouring, and some both.
- Focus on the symbolic nature of the act, representing washing away of sin and commitment to Christ.


**4. Historical/Cultural Interpretations:**
- Some interpretations are influenced by cultural contexts. For example, early Church baptisms were often performed by immersion in large bodies of water.


**5. Non-Traditional Christian Groups:**
- Diverse practices exist, with some performing immersion, others using water in other ways, or not practicing baptism at all.


**Additional Considerations:**

* The Bible does not explicitly prescribe a specific method of baptism.
* Different interpretations reflect varying theological perspectives on the sacrament.
* Respectful dialogue and understanding of diverse practices are important within Christianity.
