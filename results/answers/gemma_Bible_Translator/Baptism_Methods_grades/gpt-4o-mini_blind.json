  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: This response provides a decent overview of the different methods of baptism mentioned in the Bible and offers a variety of interpretations in different Christian contexts. However, the student could improve the grade by providing stronger biblical references for each method of baptism mentioned. Additionally, the section on \"Additional Considerations\" could be expanded to include more depth on the theological significance of baptism and the importance of unity in diversity within the body of Christ."
