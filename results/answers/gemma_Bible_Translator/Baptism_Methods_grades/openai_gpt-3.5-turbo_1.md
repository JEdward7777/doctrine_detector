**2. Sprinkling/Pouring:**

- Primarily seen in the Old Testament as a blessing for children.

**3. Full Immersion:**

- Represents washing away of sin and entering a new life in Christ.


**4. Washing with Water:**

- Mentioned in the New Testament as a symbol of physical cleansing and transformation. 


## Interpretations in Various Christian Contexts:

**1. Evangelical/Pentecostal:**
- Emphasis on believer's baptism by immersion as the only valid baptism.
- Seen as a visible representation of forgiveness of sins and initiation into Christian life.


**2. Roman Catholic:**
- Baptism by pouring is practiced for infants, while adult converts are immersed.
- Seen as an essential sacrament with forgiveness of sins and incorporation into the Church.


**3. Protestant Denominations:**
- Views on baptism vary, with some accepting immersion, others pouring, and some both.
- Focus on the symbolic nature of the act, representing washing away of sin and commitment to Christ.
