  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of baptism in the life of a Christian according to New Testament teachings. However, the answer was overly detailed and included aspects that were not directly linked to the concern of understanding the importance of baptism in the Christian faith. The reference answer succinctly captures the core message of baptism, which the student's response could have reflected more closely."
