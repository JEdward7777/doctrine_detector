  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and doctrinally sound explanation of the relationship between repentance and baptism as presented in the New Testament. The student effectively incorporates relevant biblical references, articulates the significance of both repentance and baptism, and emphasizes the necessary order of events for believers. The emphasis on the transformative work of God through these actions aligns well with Christian doctrine. Great job!"
