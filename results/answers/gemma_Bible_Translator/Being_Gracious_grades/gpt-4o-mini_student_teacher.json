  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that effectively connects the definition of \"gracious\" to the Christian obligation to be forgiving and kind. They incorporated biblical references and highlighted key implications for interactions with others based on the concept of God's grace. However, the student's response may have delved slightly beyond the specific concern, leading to a minor deduction in points. Nonetheless, they demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and effectively applied a Christian worldview perspective."
