The answer includes key points such as belief in an afterlife, spirits, the intermediate state, and angelic beings, showing a good understanding of the topic. However, the mention of Greek philosophy's influence on Pharisaic beliefs could be further elaborated and supported with specific examples or references. Additionally, connecting these beliefs more explicitly to relevant biblical passages or teachings would strengthen the answer. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological analysis."
