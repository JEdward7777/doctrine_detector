  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive explanation of Pharisaic beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings, incorporating various aspects such as afterlife concepts, beliefs in spirits, the intermediate state, and angelic beings. However, the response lacks direct reference to the teacher's specific answer, which focused on distinguishing Pharisees from other Jewish groups like the Sadducees in terms of their beliefs. The student's answer could have been strengthened by directly addressing this concern and tying it back to the Pharisees' beliefs."
