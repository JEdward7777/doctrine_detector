The response does not accurately capture the complexity of Pharisaic beliefs about the afterlife, spirits, or angels. Additionally, it fails to mention the influence of Greek philosophy on Pharisaic beliefs, which is a significant aspect of their theological landscape during Jesus' time. To better meet the concern, the response could have explored these beliefs in more detail and provided specific examples from Pharisaic practices and texts."
