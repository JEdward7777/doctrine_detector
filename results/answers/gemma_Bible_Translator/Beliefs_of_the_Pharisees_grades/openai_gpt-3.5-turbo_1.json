The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring these beliefs in the context of the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time. The only potential improvement could be linking the specific beliefs mentioned in the response to how they may have influenced or interacted with Jesus' teachings or interactions with the Pharisees during his ministry."
