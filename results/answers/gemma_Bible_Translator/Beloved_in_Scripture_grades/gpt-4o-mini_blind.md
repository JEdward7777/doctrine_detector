**In the New Testament letters, the term "beloved" is primarily used in two ways:**

**1. To express affectionate affection and encouragement:**

* The writer expresses deep love and care for the recipients of the letter.
* This is seen in letters like 1 John 3:1, where the writer calls the recipients "beloved," urging them to love one another.
* In Romans 1:13, Paul calls the church in Rome his "beloved in Christ Jesus."

**2. To emphasize God's love for the church:**

* The writer highlights God's unconditional love and acceptance for the church.
* This is evident in numerous letters, such as Ephesians 1:6, where Paul describes Christ as "faithful until death, so that he might give himself for his beloved."
* In Colossians 3:14, Paul urges the church to "clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience," because they are "beloved of God."

**Biblical references:**

* **Matthew 22:39:** "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength."
* **1 John 3:1:** "See how great a love the Father has for us, that he has called us to be his sons and daughters!"
* **Romans 1:13:** "I call upon you to be affectionate and faithful in love."
* **Ephesians 1:6:** "He is faithful until death, so that he might give himself for his beloved."
* **Colossians 3:14:** "And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity."

Comment: The answer provides a clear explanation of how the term "beloved" is used in the New Testament letters to Christian churches, highlighting both its expression of affection towards the recipients and emphasizing God's love for the church. The biblical references provided support the points made. However, to improve the grade, the student could deepen the theological implications of being called "beloved" in the context of God's unconditional love and the believer's identity in Christ. Additionally, integrating scriptural examples specific to the term "beloved" in the New Testament letters would enhance the doctrinal depth of the response.
