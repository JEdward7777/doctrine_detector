**In the New Testament letters, the term "beloved" is primarily used in two ways:**

**1. To express affectionate affection and encouragement:**

* The writer expresses deep love and care for the recipients of the letter.
* This is seen in letters like 1 John 3:1, where the writer calls the recipients "beloved," urging them to love one another.
* In Romans 1:13, Paul calls the church in Rome his "beloved in Christ Jesus."

**2. To emphasize God's love for the church:**

* The writer highlights God's unconditional love and acceptance for the church.
* This is evident in numerous letters, such as Ephesians 1:6, where Paul describes Christ as "faithful until death, so that he might give himself for his beloved."
* In Colossians 3:14, Paul urges the church to "clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience," because they are "beloved of God."

**Biblical references:**

* **Matthew 22:39:** "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength."
* **1 John 3:1:** "See how great a love the Father has for us, that he has called us to be his sons and daughters!"
* **Romans 1:13:** "I call upon you to be affectionate and faithful in love."
