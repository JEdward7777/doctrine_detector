  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the responsibilities of deacons according to the New Testament. They covered various aspects such as service to the church, care for those in need, integrity, humility, and modeling Christian values. However, the specified concern about ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community was not directly addressed in the student's answer. While the student's response provides a holistic view of deacons' responsibilities, the lack of specific emphasis on fair distribution of resources like money and food to widows as mentioned in the reference answer slightly detracts from addressing the concern fully."
