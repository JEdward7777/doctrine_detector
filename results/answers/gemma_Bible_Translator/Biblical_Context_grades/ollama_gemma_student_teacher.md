## [Answer](../Biblical_Context.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
## New Testament Responsibilities of Deacons:

The New Testament reveals two primary aspects of deacons' responsibilities: **service to the church** and **care for those in need**.

**1. Service to the Church:**

* **Supporting the work of the elders:** 
    * Acts 6:2-4 emphasizes deacons serve the elders by assisting with practical tasks and freeing them for more spiritual leadership.
* **Organizing and managing church activities:**
    * 1 Timothy 3:8-13 suggests deacons should be organized and efficient in handling logistics, finances, and other practical aspects of church life.
* **Encouraging and uplifting the church:**
    * 1 Peter 4:10 instructs deacons to use their talents to "serve one another." This can include offering encouragement, support, and practical assistance to fellow believers.

**2. Care for those in need:**

* **Compassionate outreach:**
    * Acts 6:2 describes deacons as those who "serve tables" â€“ caring for the physical needs of widows, orphans, and others in difficult situations.
* **Material aid distribution:**
    * 1 Timothy 5:16 instructs deacons to be "hospitable" and "ready to share." This can include providing practical assistance to those in need, such as food, clothing, or shelter.
* **Social justice advocacy:**
    * The New Testament emphasizes the importance of caring for the poor and marginalized (see James 2:14-17). While deacons are not explicitly called to social activism, their compassion and care for the materially needy often overlaps with broader social justice concerns.

**Additional Responsibilities:**

* **Integrity and faithfulness:** 
    * 1 Timothy 3:8-13 emphasizes that deacons must be "blameless" and "faithful" in their service.
* **Humility and service mindset:** 
    * Serving others should be done with humility and a genuine desire to help others. 
* **Modeling Christian values:** 
    * Deacons are expected to embody the values of Christ in their actions and interactions with others.
