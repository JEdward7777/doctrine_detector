  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the New Testament responsibilities of deacons, emphasizing their service to the church and care for those in need. It aligns well with the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community by highlighting the importance of compassionate outreach, material aid distribution, and social justice advocacy. The inclusion of relevant biblical references further strengthens the theological foundation of the response. The only suggestion for improvement would be to elaborate further on the broader range of responsibilities deacons hold beyond just resource distribution, although the response does touch on aspects of integrity, humility, and modeling Christian values."
