  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies the role of deacons in ensuring fair distribution of resources like money and food, particularly to widows, which aligns with the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community. However, the response lacks depth and detail in discussing the broader responsibilities of deacons as outlined in the New Testament. It would have been stronger if the response had addressed the wider scope of deacons' responsibilities, such as serving the church, organizing activities, providing material aid, and advocating for social justice, as detailed in the provided New Testament passages."
