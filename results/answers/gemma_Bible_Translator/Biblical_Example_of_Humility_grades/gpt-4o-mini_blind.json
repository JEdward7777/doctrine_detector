  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a strong and well-supported answer showcasing Paul as a biblical example of humility. They referenced specific passages where Paul demonstrated humility and connected it to the broader concept of humility as a foundational virtue in Christian living. The answer could have been slightly improved by providing more direct biblical quotes to support each point. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound response. Well done!"
