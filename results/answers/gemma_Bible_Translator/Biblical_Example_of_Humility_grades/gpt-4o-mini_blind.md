Certainly! One of the most profound examples of humility in the Bible is the apostle Paul. Throughout his letters, Paul demonstrates a deep understanding of God's greatness and his own unworthiness in God's sight.

**Here are some specific instances where Paul exhibits humility:**

* **Philippians 2:6-8:** Paul describes himself as "not counting myself to be anything" because of Christ's humility towards him. 
* **Romans 11:33:** Paul acknowledges that his achievements are due to God's grace and not his own merit.
* **2 Corinthians 12:9:** Paul describes himself as the "chief of sinners" and unworthy of any praise.
* **1 Timothy 3:16:** Paul emphasizes that he does not speak because of his own wisdom but because of the enlightenment God has given him.

These are just a few examples of Paul's remarkable humility. Throughout his life, he demonstrated a willingness to put others before himself, to acknowledge God's sovereignty, and to accept his own limitations.

**Humility is a foundational virtue for Christian living.** Jesus himself embodied humility in his life and ministry, and he commands his followers to follow his example. By practicing humility, we acknowledge God's greatness, focus on serving others, and experience greater joy and fulfillment in our faith.
