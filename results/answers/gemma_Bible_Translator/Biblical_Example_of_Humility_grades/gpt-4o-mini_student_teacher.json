  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided an in-depth analysis of Paul's humility as seen in various biblical passages, which is commendable. However, the student did not align their response with the specific biblical example requested in the question. They focused on Paul instead of providing an example of humility like David. Despite the rich content provided, the response does not directly address the concern of providing tangible examples of humility in the scriptures, which is why the grade is not higher."
