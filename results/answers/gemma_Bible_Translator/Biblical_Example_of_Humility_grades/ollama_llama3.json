  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides several specific examples from Scripture that demonstrate humility, including instances from Paul's letters in Philippians, Romans, 2 Corinthians, and 1 Timothy. These examples are relevant to the concern about finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. The writer also connects these examples to broader Christian themes, such as God's sovereignty and the importance of putting others before oneself.\n\nThe only areas for improvement would be to make more explicit connections between Paul's humility and David's example, as mentioned in the original answer. Additionally, while the response effectively highlights the significance of humility in Christian living, it could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of what humility looks like in everyday life or how it is lived out practically.\n\nOverall, this response provides a strong foundation for understanding humility in Scripture and its importance in Christian living, earning an 85."
