# Stated Concern
Finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One of the most profound examples of humility in the Bible is the apostle Paul. Throughout his letters, Paul demonstrates a deep understanding of God's greatness and his own unworthiness in God's sight.

**Here are some specific instances where Paul exhibits humility:**

* **Philippians 2:6-8:** Paul describes himself as "not counting myself to be anything" because of Christ's humility towards him. 
* **Romans 11:33:** Paul acknowledges that his achievements are due to God's grace and not his own merit.
* **2 Corinthians 12:9:** Paul describes himself as the "chief of sinners" and unworthy of any praise.
* **1 Timothy 3:16:** Paul emphasizes that he does not speak because of his own wisdom but because of the enlightenment God has given him.

These are just a few examples of Paul's remarkable humility. Throughout his life, he demonstrated a willingness to put others before himself, to acknowledge God's sovereignty, and to accept his own limitations.

**Humility is a foundational virtue for Christian living.** Jesus himself embodied humility in his life and ministry, and he commands his followers to follow his example. By practicing humility, we acknowledge God's greatness, focus on serving others, and experience greater joy and fulfillment in our faith.

85.0

I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides several specific examples from Scripture that demonstrate humility, including instances from Paul's letters in Philippians, Romans, 2 Corinthians, and 1 Timothy. These examples are relevant to the concern about finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. The writer also connects these examples to broader Christian themes, such as God's sovereignty and the importance of putting others before oneself.

The only areas for improvement would be to make more explicit connections between Paul's humility and David's example, as mentioned in the original answer. Additionally, while the response effectively highlights the significance of humility in Christian living, it could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of what humility looks like in everyday life or how it is lived out practically.

Overall, this response provides a strong foundation for understanding humility in Scripture and its importance in Christian living, earning an 85.
