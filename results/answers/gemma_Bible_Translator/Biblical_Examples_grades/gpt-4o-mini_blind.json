The inclusion of Enoch, David, Joseph, Daniel, and Jesus as examples is appropriate, and the lessons learned about integrity, humility, faithfulness, compassion, and resilience are well articulated. The addition of the reminder that these figures are meant to inspire rather than suggest perfection is also commendable. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific references to biblical passages that illustrate the blamelessness of each individual mentioned. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
