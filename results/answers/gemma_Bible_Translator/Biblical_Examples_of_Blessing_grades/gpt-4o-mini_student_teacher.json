  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained example from the Bible in Genesis 1:28 where God blesses human beings with the responsibility to care for creation. While their answer aligned with the concept of God blessing creation through human stewardship, the reference answer provided a more direct example of God blessing the creatures of the sea and birds in Genesis 1:22. The student's response demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have been more closely aligned with the specific concern of illustrating blessings in scripture."
