## Question [Biblical Examples of Blessing](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md)
Can you provide an example from the Bible where God blesses creation?

## Correct Answer
In Genesis 1:22, God blessed the creatures of the sea and the birds, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply.'

## Stated Concern
Knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One such example can be found in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:28, God blesses the work of human hands by commanding them to subdue the earth and have dominion over its creatures.

**Genesis 1:28:** "And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living creature that moves on the earth.'"

In this verse, God acknowledges the creativity and stewardship of human beings, and He grants them the privilege and responsibility to care for and manage the natural world. This blessing includes the use of resources, the preservation of life, and the responsible management of the environment.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a well-explained example from the Bible in Genesis 1:28 where God blesses human beings with the responsibility to care for creation. While their answer aligned with the concept of God blessing creation through human stewardship, the reference answer provided a more direct example of God blessing the creatures of the sea and birds in Genesis 1:22. The student's response demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have been more closely aligned with the specific concern of illustrating blessings in scripture.
