  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe student correctly references Genesis as an example, which addresses the concern of knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture. However, they incorrectly cite Genesis 1:22 instead of Genesis 1:28, where God actually blesses humanity's work and grants them dominion over the earth.\n\nWhile the response mentions the concept of blessing and responsibility, it does not fully illustrate this concept in the way that the original verse (Genesis 1:28) does. The student would benefit from a more accurate understanding of the biblical text and its implications for human responsibility towards creation.\n\nGrade comment: This response shows potential but is hindered by inaccuracy. To improve, students should focus on precise scriptural references and thoughtful application of biblical concepts to real-world issues."
