# Question [Biblical Examples of Blessing](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md)
Can you provide an example from the Bible where God blesses creation?

# Correct Answer
In Genesis 1:22, God blessed the creatures of the sea and the birds, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply.'

# Stated Concern
Knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One such example can be found in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:28, God blesses the work of human hands by commanding them to subdue the earth and have dominion over its creatures.

**Genesis 1:28:** "And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living creature that moves on the earth.'"

In this verse, God acknowledges the creativity and stewardship of human beings, and He grants them the privilege and responsibility to care for and manage the natural world. This blessing includes the use of resources, the preservation of life, and the responsible management of the environment.

I would give this response a score of 60.

The student correctly references Genesis as an example, which addresses the concern of knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture. However, they incorrectly cite Genesis 1:22 instead of Genesis 1:28, where God actually blesses humanity's work and grants them dominion over the earth.

While the response mentions the concept of blessing and responsibility, it does not fully illustrate this concept in the way that the original verse (Genesis 1:28) does. The student would benefit from a more accurate understanding of the biblical text and its implications for human responsibility towards creation.

Grade comment: This response shows potential but is hindered by inaccuracy. To improve, students should focus on precise scriptural references and thoughtful application of biblical concepts to real-world issues.
