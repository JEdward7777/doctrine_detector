# Question [Biblical Examples of Blessing](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md)
Can you provide an example from the Bible where God blesses creation?

# Correct Answer
In Genesis 1:22, God blessed the creatures of the sea and the birds, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply.'

# Stated Concern
Knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One such example can be found in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:28, God blesses the work of human hands by commanding them to subdue the earth and have dominion over its creatures.

**Genesis 1:28:** "And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living creature that moves on the earth.'"

In this verse, God acknowledges the creativity and stewardship of human beings, and He grants them the privilege and responsibility to care for and manage the natural world. This blessing includes the use of resources, the preservation of life, and the responsible management of the environment.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response adequately addresses the concern by providing a valid example of how blessings are illustrated in scripture from Genesis 1:28. The explanation given connects the blessing to the concept of stewardship and responsible management of the environment in line with a Christian worldview. However, the grade is slightly lower due to the use of a different Bible verse (Genesis 1:22) in the initial answer, which does not directly relate to the concept of human stewardship and dominion over the earth.
