# Question [Biblical Examples of Blessing](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md)
Can you provide an example from the Bible where God blesses creation?

# Correct Answer
In Genesis 1:22, God blessed the creatures of the sea and the birds, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply.'

# Stated Concern
Knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One such example can be found in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:28, God blesses the work of human hands by commanding them to subdue the earth and have dominion over its creatures.

**Genesis 1:28:** "And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living creature that moves on the earth.'"

In this verse, God acknowledges the creativity and stewardship of human beings, and He grants them the privilege and responsibility to care for and manage the natural world. This blessing includes the use of resources, the preservation of life, and the responsible management of the environment.

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of how blessings are illustrated in scripture, specifically referencing Genesis 1:28 and the blessing bestowed upon humans to subdue and have dominion over the earth. However, there is a slight deviation in the original answer provided, which referenced Genesis 1:22 instead of the correct verse, Genesis 1:28. This discrepancy affects the accuracy of the response, but overall, the explanation is sound and aligns well with the Christian worldview.
