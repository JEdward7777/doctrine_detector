## Question [Biblical Examples of Blessing](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md)
Can you provide an example from the Bible where God blesses creation?

## Correct Answer
In Genesis 1:22, God blessed the creatures of the sea and the birds, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply.'

## Stated Concern
Knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One such example can be found in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:28, God blesses the work of human hands by commanding them to subdue the earth and have dominion over its creatures.

**Genesis 1:28:** "And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living creature that moves on the earth.'"

In this verse, God acknowledges the creativity and stewardship of human beings, and He grants them the privilege and responsibility to care for and manage the natural world. This blessing includes the use of resources, the preservation of life, and the responsible management of the environment.

Comment: The response provides a relevant example from the book of Genesis that aligns with the concern of illustrating blessings in scripture. The reference to Genesis 1:28 accurately demonstrates how God's blessing entails not only procreation but also stewardship and dominion over the earth. However, there was a slight confusion in the initial response regarding the specific verse mentioned, which affects the overall accuracy and clarity of the answer.
