The references are appropriately cited, and the point about Jesus' ultimate vindication before God is well-stated. However, the explanation could further emphasize the significance of Jesus' innocence from a doctrinal standpoint, highlighting the role of his purity in the redemptive work of salvation. Additionally, connecting these examples to broader theological themes such as substitutionary atonement and the fulfillment of prophecy could enhance the depth of the analysis."
