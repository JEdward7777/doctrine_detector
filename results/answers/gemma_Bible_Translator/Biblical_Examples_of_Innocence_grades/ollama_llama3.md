# Question [Biblical Examples of Innocence](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md)
Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

# Correct Answer
Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

# Stated Concern
These examples serve to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
## Examples from Scripture Illustrating Innocence:

**1. Jesus' innocence before Herod:**

* Matthew 2:18-23: Herod was enraged by Jesus' growing popularity and accused him of being mad. Despite having no evidence, Herod condemned Jesus to death.
* Mark 6:14-16: Jesus was accused of blasphemy by the scribes, leading to his arrest and crucifixion.

**2. Jesus' innocence before Pontius Pilate:**

* John 18:33-38: Pilate initially found Jesus innocent but yielded to the pressure of the crowd and sentenced him to death.

**3. Jesus' innocence in his suffering:**

* Isaiah 53:9: "He was oppressed and humiliated; he suffered, yet did not open his mouth. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearer, he did not open his lips."
* 1 Peter 3:9: "He suffered unjustly because he was innocent."

**4. Accusers' false accusations:**

* Mark 8:15: The scribes accused Jesus of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul, even though they knew it was false.
* John 10:33: The Jews accused Jesus of being a Samaritan and a glutton, despite having no evidence to support these claims.

**5. Jesus' vindication before God:**

* Hebrews 7:26: "For he was faithful until death, and God highly exalted him because of his suffering."
* 1 Peter 2:24: "For he himself suffered under the law, and the divine decree was fulfilled in him. He became the head of sin and the source of life."

These examples demonstrate the profound injustice Jesus faced at the hands of his accusers. Despite being innocent, he endured false accusations, malicious trials, and brutal suffering. However, God ultimately vindicated Jesus, recognizing his perfect innocence and declaring him the rightful heir to the throne.

I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response provides several biblical examples that demonstrate Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations, which aligns with the concern of illustrating key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence. The examples from Scripture are relevant and well-chosen, including Jesus' interactions with Herod, Pilate, and the crucifixion.

However, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting these examples to the concern. While it is clear that the examples are meant to demonstrate Jesus' innocence, the connection between the examples and the concern could be made more explicit. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer summary or conclusion that ties together the various examples and reiterates the main point.

Overall, while the response is strong in terms of providing relevant biblical examples, it could be improved by making a stronger connection to the concern and providing a clearer summary or conclusion.
