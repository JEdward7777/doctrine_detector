## Key Examples of Mercy in the Bible:

**1. God's Mercy Towards Israel:**

* Throughout the Bible, God demonstrates mercy towards his chosen people, Israel. Even after repeated rebellion and disobedience, God offers forgiveness and redemption through Jesus Christ. (See: Exodus 32:14, Hosea 11:1, Romans 11:33)

**2. God's Mercy Towards the Nations:**

* God's mercy extends beyond Israel to the nations. He offers salvation to all who repent and believe in him. (See: Matthew 21:31-32, Ephesians 2:8-9)

**3. Mercy in Christ's Ministry:**

* Jesus exemplified mercy in his interactions with people. He healed the sick, forgave sins, and showed compassion to the marginalized. (See: Matthew 9:20-22, Luke 5:12-13)

**4. Mercy in the New Testament:**

* The early church practiced mercy, sharing with those in need and offering encouragement and support. (See: Acts 2:42-45, 1 Peter 3:8)

**5. God's Mercy as a Foundation for Faith:**

* Mercy is foundational to faith. God's mercy motivates us to love him and obey him. (See: Romans 3:24, Ephesians 2:8-9)

**6. God's Mercy in Judgment:**

* While God demonstrates mercy, he also exercises justice. His mercy is not a denial of justice, but rather a demonstration of God's character as a fair and loving judge. (See: Revelation 3:18, James 2:13)


These examples illustrate the wide range of God's mercy â€“ from his forgiveness and redemption of individuals to his compassionate acts towards the nations and his foundational role in building faith.
