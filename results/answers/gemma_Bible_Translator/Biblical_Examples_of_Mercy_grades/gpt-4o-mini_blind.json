  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided solid examples from the Bible illustrating the concept of mercy in various contexts. They have correctly highlighted God's mercy towards Israel, the nations, and individuals through Jesus Christ. The connections to key Scripture verses support their points effectively. However, the student could enhance their response by delving deeper into the theological significance of God's mercy alongside justice, emphasizing the importance of repentance and faith in receiving God's mercy."
