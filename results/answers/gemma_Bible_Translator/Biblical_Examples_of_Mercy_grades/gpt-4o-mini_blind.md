## Key Examples of Mercy in the Bible:

**1. God's Mercy Towards Israel:**

* Throughout the Bible, God demonstrates mercy towards his chosen people, Israel. Even after repeated rebellion and disobedience, God offers forgiveness and redemption through Jesus Christ. (See: Exodus 32:14, Hosea 11:1, Romans 11:33)

**2. God's Mercy Towards the Nations:**

* God's mercy extends beyond Israel to the nations. He offers salvation to all who repent and believe in him. (See: Matthew 21:31-32, Ephesians 2:8-9)

**3. Mercy in Christ's Ministry:**

* Jesus exemplified mercy in his interactions with people. He healed the sick, forgave sins, and showed compassion to the marginalized. (See: Matthew 9:20-22, Luke 5:12-13)

**4. Mercy in the New Testament:**

* The early church practiced mercy, sharing with those in need and offering encouragement and support. (See: Acts 2:42-45, 1 Peter 3:8)

**5. God's Mercy as a Foundation for Faith:**

* Mercy is foundational to faith. God's mercy motivates us to love him and obey him. (See: Romans 3:24, Ephesians 2:8-9)

**6. God's Mercy in Judgment:**

* While God demonstrates mercy, he also exercises justice. His mercy is not a denial of justice, but rather a demonstration of God's character as a fair and loving judge. (See: Revelation 3:18, James 2:13)


These examples illustrate the wide range of God's mercy â€“ from his forgiveness and redemption of individuals to his compassionate acts towards the nations and his foundational role in building faith.

Comment: The student has provided solid examples from the Bible illustrating the concept of mercy in various contexts. They have correctly highlighted God's mercy towards Israel, the nations, and individuals through Jesus Christ. The connections to key Scripture verses support their points effectively. However, the student could enhance their response by delving deeper into the theological significance of God's mercy alongside justice, emphasizing the importance of repentance and faith in receiving God's mercy.
