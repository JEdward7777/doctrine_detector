While the examples of the Persian Empire, the Good Samaritan parable, and the tax collector's prayer are good, the response could be strengthened by incorporating more specific Bible verses and explaining how these examples enhance understanding of mercy through a Christian worldview. Additionally, a more thorough examination of God's mercy as shown in the Bible, Christ's ministry, and the early church would have further enriched the response."
