  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of various examples from the Bible illustrating the power and importance of prayer. They effectively highlighted key themes such as humility, faithfulness, authenticity, and community in prayer. However, the student missed including some crucial examples provided in the reference answer, such as Isaac praying for Rebekah's fertility and Moses praying for the people. Integrating these additional examples would have further enriched their response. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and effectively connected biblical stories to fostering a stronger prayer life."
