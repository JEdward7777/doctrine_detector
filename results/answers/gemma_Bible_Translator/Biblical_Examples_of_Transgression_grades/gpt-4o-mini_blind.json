The student effectively cites key passages from Genesis, Romans, 1 John, Galatians, and Psalms, offering clear explanations and interpretations of each. Additionally, the inclusion of additional references like 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, and Revelation adds depth to the discussion. However, to improve the answer, the student could further elaborate on the theological implications and consequences of transgression in Christian doctrine. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
