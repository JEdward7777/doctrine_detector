  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of Biblical references that illustrate the concept of transgression. The references chosen effectively portray transgression as disobeying God's commands and the consequences that follow such actions. Including additional references for further exploration and emphasizing the importance of interpreting these passages within Christian theology adds depth to the response. However, the student missed incorporating the exact references specified in the reference answer, impacting the completeness of the response."
