  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of examples of trespass in the Bible, both in physical and spiritual contexts, along with relevant verses. The connection between these instances and the moral or spiritual lessons learned is well explained. The lessons derived from these examples are articulated effectively, emphasizing respect for boundaries, spiritual purity, purity of heart, the importance of boundaries, and the consequences of trespass. The additional considerations provided at the end demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic. Overall, a solid response with doctrinal correctness evident throughout. Great job!"
