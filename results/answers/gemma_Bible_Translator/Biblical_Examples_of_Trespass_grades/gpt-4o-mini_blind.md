## Lessons Learned:

**3. Purity of Heart:**

* True worship must be sincere and genuine.

**5. Consequences of Trespass:**

* Trespassing can result in punishment, both in this life and in the next.
* We must take responsibility for our actions and avoid anything that would bring harm to ourselves or others.

## Additional Considerations:
