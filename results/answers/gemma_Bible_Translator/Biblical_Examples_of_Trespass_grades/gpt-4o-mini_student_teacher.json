  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough list of examples of physical and spiritual trespass in the Bible, along with corresponding lessons learned. However, the answer lacks the teacher's referenced examples from 1 Samuel 25:28 and Romans 5:20-21, which would have enriched the discussion on God's forgiveness and grace in relation to trespass. Incorporating these biblical references would have strengthened the student's answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
