  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer by referencing multiple passages from the Bible that contrast genuine worship with idol worship. They effectively highlighted the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. The only suggestion for improvement would be to focus more on directly addressing the specific concern related to idol worship contrasted with genuine worship, as stated in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
