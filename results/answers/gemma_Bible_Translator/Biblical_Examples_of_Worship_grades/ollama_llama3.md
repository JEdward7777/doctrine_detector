# Question [Biblical Examples of Worship](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md)
Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

# Correct Answer
One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

# Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One such example can be found in the book of Exodus.

**Exodus 32:**

* Verses 1-5 describe the Israelites making and worshipping a golden calf, which they called "Absalom." This action directly contradicts the Lord's command to worship only him.
* Verses 19-20 highlight God's displeasure with the Israelites' idolatry, stating, "I will blot out the name of the god Abaddon from under heaven" and "You shall have no other gods before me."

This passage clearly contrasts genuine worship of the one true God with the abomination of idol worship.

**Additional examples:**

* **1 Kings 19:** The prophets of Baal worship by cutting themselves and offering sacrifices, while Elijah demonstrates true worship through prayer and the power of God.
* **2 Kings 23:** King Josiah removes the idols from the temple and reforms true worship of the Lord.

These instances demonstrate the consistent biblical condemnation of idol worship and the exaltation of genuine worship of the one true God.

Grade: 85%

The response provides some relevant biblical examples that illustrate the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. The examples from Exodus, 1 Kings, and 2 Kings demonstrate the biblical condemnation of idol worship and the exaltation of genuine worship of the one true God.

However, the response does not directly address the concern about avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. While it touches on this issue indirectly through the examples provided, a more explicit discussion of how these biblical accounts relate to modern-day idolatry and the importance of staying faithful to God's commands would have strengthened the response.

To reach a higher grade, the response could have explicitly connected the biblical examples to the concern about avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.
