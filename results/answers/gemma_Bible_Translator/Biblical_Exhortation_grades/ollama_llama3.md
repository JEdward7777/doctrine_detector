# Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The directive Jesus gave to his apostles regarding the good news is encapsulated in the Great Commission found in Matthew 28:18-20. 

**Jesus commanded his apostles to:**

* **Go** to all nations.
* **Teach** them to observe all things he commanded.
* **Preach** the gospel of salvation, offering forgiveness of sins through his name.
* **Baptize** them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

This directive highlights two key aspects of sharing the good news: **teaching** and **preaching**. 

**Teaching** involves:

* Explaining the teachings of Jesus in a clear and understandable way.
* Demonstrating Christian values through actions and lifestyles.

**Preaching** involves:

* Communicating the saving message of Jesus Christ to others.
* Sharing the joy and peace that come through faith in him.

Therefore, the good news is not merely about disseminating information, but also about transforming lives through the power of the Holy Spirit.

The response generally shows a good understanding of the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith, as demonstrated by its focus on Jesus' directive to share the Good News with all nations (Matthew 28:18-20). The response also highlights two key aspects of sharing the Good News: teaching and preaching. Additionally, it emphasizes that the Good News is not just about disseminating information, but also about transforming lives through the power of the Holy Spirit.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or illustrations to support its points. For instance, while it mentions "explaining the teachings of Jesus in a clear and understandable way" as part of teaching, it would have been helpful to provide some concrete examples of how this might look in practice. Similarly, while it mentions that preaching involves sharing the joy and peace that come through faith in Jesus Christ, it would have been beneficial to provide some practical suggestions for how Christians can effectively share these aspects of their faith with others.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of evangelism and provides some useful insights into its practice. With some additional detail and illustration, it could be even more effective at inspiring and motivating readers to participate in this crucial aspect of Christian witness.
