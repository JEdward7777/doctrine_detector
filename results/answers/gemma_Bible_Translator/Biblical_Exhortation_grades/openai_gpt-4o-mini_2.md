# Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The directive Jesus gave to his apostles regarding the good news is encapsulated in the Great Commission found in Matthew 28:18-20. 

**Jesus commanded his apostles to:**

* **Go** to all nations.
* **Teach** them to observe all things he commanded.
* **Preach** the gospel of salvation, offering forgiveness of sins through his name.
* **Baptize** them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

This directive highlights two key aspects of sharing the good news: **teaching** and **preaching**. 

**Teaching** involves:

* Explaining the teachings of Jesus in a clear and understandable way.
* Demonstrating Christian values through actions and lifestyles.

**Preaching** involves:

* Communicating the saving message of Jesus Christ to others.
* Sharing the joy and peace that come through faith in him.

Therefore, the good news is not merely about disseminating information, but also about transforming lives through the power of the Holy Spirit.
