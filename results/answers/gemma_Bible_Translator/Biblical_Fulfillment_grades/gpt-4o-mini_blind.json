  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively highlights the references to Jesus as \"King of the Jews\" in the Bible and connects them to Old Testament prophecies, specifically Messianic prophecies, Davidic lineage, and the concept of the Suffering Servant. The student accurately presents key scriptures and demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications. The inclusion of the challenges and interpretations section adds depth to the analysis. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful response. Great job!"
