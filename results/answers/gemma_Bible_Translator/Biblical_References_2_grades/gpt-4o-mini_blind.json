  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid list of Bible verses that illustrate the concept of God's majesty. The verses chosen effectively convey the themes of God's glory, power, sovereignty, and greatness. One improvement could be to provide a bit more contextual explanation for each verse to enhance the depth of understanding for the reader. Additionally, ensuring that all references tie back clearly to the concept of God's majesty would make the response even stronger. Overall, a thorough and doctrinally sound effort."
