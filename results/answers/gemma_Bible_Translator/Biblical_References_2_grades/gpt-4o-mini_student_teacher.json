  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided several Bible verses that illustrate the concept of God's majesty, which is commendable. However, the concern was to connect scripture with an understanding of God's majestic nature. While the verses chosen do highlight aspects of God's majesty, the reference answer provided by the teacher offers a more focused selection of verses that specifically emphasize God's majesty in a more direct manner. The student could improve their response by including verses that more explicitly convey the idea of God's majestic nature as showcased in the reference answer."
