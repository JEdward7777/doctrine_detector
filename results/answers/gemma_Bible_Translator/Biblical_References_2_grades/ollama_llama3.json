The provided references mostly focus on describing God's power and greatness, but do not explicitly address how these qualities contribute to His majesty.\n\nThe given answer mentions a few Bible passages that touch on the concept of God's majesty, such as Daniel 4:36, which describes God's dominion over all kingdoms. However, it lacks a deeper exploration of what this means for our understanding of God's majestic nature.\n\nTo improve, the response could delve more deeply into how these scriptures illustrate God's majesty and what implications this has for our understanding of Him."
