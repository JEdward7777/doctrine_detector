  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a strong selection of Bible verses that effectively illustrate God's majestic nature by highlighting aspects such as His creation, dominion, sovereignty, and eternal word. The verses chosen are relevant and support the concept of God's majesty well. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more explanation or interpretation of each verse to further deepen the connection between the scriptures and the understanding of God's majestic nature."
