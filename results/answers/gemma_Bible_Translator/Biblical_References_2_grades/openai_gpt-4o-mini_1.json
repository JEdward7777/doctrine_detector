  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a strong foundation by presenting multiple Bible verses that effectively illustrate the concept of God's majesty. Each verse is clearly explained in relation to God's majestic nature, highlighting aspects such as His glory, dominion, sovereignty, and eternal greatness. The verses chosen demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of God's majestic character. However, there was a missed opportunity to directly address the initial set of Bible references mentioned in the answer. Overall, the response effectively connects scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature."
