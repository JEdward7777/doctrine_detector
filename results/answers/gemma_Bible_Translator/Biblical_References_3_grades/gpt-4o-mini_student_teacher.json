However, the student missed the key references provided by the teacher, which include Daniel 7:14 and the usage of 'son of man' in Ezekiel. Integrating these key references would have strengthened the answer and provided a more holistic view of how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.'"
