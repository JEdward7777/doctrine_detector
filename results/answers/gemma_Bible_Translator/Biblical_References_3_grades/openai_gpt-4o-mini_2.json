It effectively uses various passages to showcase the prophetic nature of Jesus as the Son of Man, demonstrating a strong understanding of how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role. The inclusion of specific verses and their relevance to Christ's life and ministry enhances the analysis. Great job in incorporating a Christian worldview perspective into the evaluation."
