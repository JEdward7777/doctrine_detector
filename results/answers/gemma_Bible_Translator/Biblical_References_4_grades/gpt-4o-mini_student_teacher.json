  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-structured and detailed response with appropriate examples from the Bible that illustrate the use of \"Lord\" in the context of God. The explanations are clear and emphasize the authority and reverence associated with acknowledging God as \"Lord.\" However, the student missed referencing specific biblical passages mentioned in the teacher's answer, which could have further strengthened their response. Overall, a strong effort with room for improvement in aligning more closely with the given reference."
