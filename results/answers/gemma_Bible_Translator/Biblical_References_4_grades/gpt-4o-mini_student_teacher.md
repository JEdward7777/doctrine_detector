## Examples of Biblical Passages Illustrating the Use of "Lord" in the Context of God:

**1. Psalms 23:**

"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want..."

This psalm highlights the intimate and caring relationship between God as "Lord" and his people. 

**2. Ephesians 4:5:**

"One Lord, one faith, one baptism..."

This verse emphasizes the singularity and supremacy of Jesus Christ as the one true "Lord."

**3. Matthew 26:39:**

"Then he went a little further, knelt down, and prayed, 'Lord, take this cup from me...'"

This example showcases the respectful and submissive dependence on God as "Lord" in prayer.

**4. Revelation 1:4:**

"Grace to you who are in Christ Jesus, and to all who are called by his name, for you are called at the 'Lord's' command..."

This verse demonstrates the authoritative power and dominion of Jesus Christ as the "Lord."

**5. 1 Corinthians 8:6:**

"There is one God and one 'Lord' over all..."

This verse emphasizes the uniqueness and supremacy of God as the ultimate "Lord."

**Additional Points:**

* In the Bible, "Lord" often carries the sense of divine authority, majesty, and sovereignty.
* "Lord" is frequently used as a title for Jesus Christ, reflecting his divinity and uniqueness.
* The use of "Lord" can also express a deep sense of reverence, awe, and dependence on God.

**Considerations:**

* Bible translations may render "Lord" differently, using terms like "Lord," "God," or "Master."
* The context and surrounding verses are important for understanding the precise meaning of "Lord" in each passage.
