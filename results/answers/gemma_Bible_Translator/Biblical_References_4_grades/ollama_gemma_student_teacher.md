## Examples of Biblical Passages Illustrating the Use of "Lord" in the Context of God:

**1. Psalms 23:**

"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want..."

"One Lord, one faith, one baptism..."

This verse emphasizes the singularity and supremacy of Jesus Christ as the one true "Lord."

**3. Matthew 26:39:**

"Then he went a little further, knelt down, and prayed, 'Lord, take this cup from me...'"

This example showcases the respectful and submissive dependence on God as "Lord" in prayer.

**4. Revelation 1:4:**

"Grace to you who are in Christ Jesus, and to all who are called by his name, for you are called at the 'Lord's' command..."
