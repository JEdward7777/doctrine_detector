## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**1 Corinthians 5:7-8** connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings on the Lord's Supper and purity in worship.

**1 Corinthians 5:7-8:**

"Therefore let us examine ourselves to see whether we are in the faith; and let us cleanse ourselves from any contamination of the flesh. As obedient children of God, we must not participate in the unholy practices of the pagans, for I am afraid that even the title of 'Christian' will be misused by those who observe such things."

**Interpretation:**

* This passage highlights the importance of purity in Christian worship and practices.
* It connects the symbolism of unleavened bread in the Lord's Supper to the need for spiritual purity.
* The apostle Paul warns against participating in pagan practices that involve leaven, as this would be a compromise of Christian beliefs.

**Therefore, this scripture establishes a connection between the concept of unleavened bread and Christian teachings on purity and the sanctity of worship.**

Comment: The student has correctly identified 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 as the New Testament scripture connecting the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings, particularly in the context of purity in worship. The interpretation provided demonstrates a good understanding of the passage's significance in emphasizing spiritual purity and the avoidance of pagan practices. However, the response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the cultural context of the Corinthian church and the historical significance of unleavened bread in the Jewish tradition, which would provide a deeper layer of understanding to the connection between the concept of unleavened bread and Christian teachings.
