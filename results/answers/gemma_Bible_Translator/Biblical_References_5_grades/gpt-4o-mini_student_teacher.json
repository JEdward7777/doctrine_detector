  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 80.\n\nThe student correctly identified 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 as the relevant passage connecting the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings, specifically in reference to the Lord's Supper and purity in worship. The interpretation provided highlights the importance of purity in Christian practices and makes a solid connection between the symbolism of unleavened bread and spiritual purity.\n\nHowever, the student's explanation could have been strengthened by directly referencing the removal of sin from the church in verse 6 of 1 Corinthians 5, which is a key aspect of the biblical text in relation to unleavened bread and Christian life. By incorporating this aspect into their interpretation, the student could have more closely aligned with the teacher's specific concern of identifying biblical texts that provide insight into Christian practices."
