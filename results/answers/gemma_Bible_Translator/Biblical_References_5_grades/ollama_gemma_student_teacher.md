## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**1 Corinthians 5:7-8** connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings on the Lord's Supper and purity in worship.

**1 Corinthians 5:7-8:**

"Therefore let us examine ourselves to see whether we are in the faith; and let us cleanse ourselves from any contamination of the flesh. As obedient children of God, we must not participate in the unholy practices of the pagans, for I am afraid that even the title of 'Christian' will be misused by those who observe such things."

**Interpretation:**

* This passage highlights the importance of purity in Christian worship and practices.
