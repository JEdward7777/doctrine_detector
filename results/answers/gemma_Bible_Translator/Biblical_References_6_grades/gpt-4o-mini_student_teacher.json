The references to the empty tomb, Jesus' resurrection appearances, Paul's testimony, early church writings, and passages from Psalms and Prophets effectively support the concept of resurrection in Christian faith. However, the student could have included some of the specific verses mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher to enhance the completeness of the response."
