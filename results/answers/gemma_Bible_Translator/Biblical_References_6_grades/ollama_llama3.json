  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of resurrection in Christian theology, providing a comprehensive list of relevant Bible verses that support the idea of Jesus' physical resurrection from the dead. The inclusion of passages from various books of the New Testament, including Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Paul's epistles, shows a good grasp of the biblical narrative surrounding resurrection.\n\nThe response also highlights the importance of resurrection as a central doctrine in Christian faith, emphasizing its connection to God's power and sovereignty over life and death. The mention of early Church writings, such as 1 Clement and 2 Clement, adds depth and historical context to the discussion.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more analysis and reflection on the significance of the verses cited. While the list is comprehensive, it would be helpful to see some commentary on how these passages relate to each other and to the broader Christian understanding of resurrection.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a strong commitment to grounding beliefs in Scripture, which aligns with the concern mentioned earlier."
