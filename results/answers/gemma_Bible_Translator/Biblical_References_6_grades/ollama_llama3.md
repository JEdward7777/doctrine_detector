**1. The Empty Tomb:**

* Matthew 28:1-10
* Mark 16:1-8

These verses describe the various occasions Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, proving his physical presence.

**3. Paul's Testimony:**

* 1 Corinthians 15:3-4

Paul, a prominent early Christian, testifies to his personal encounter with the risen Christ and the central importance of resurrection in Christian faith.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of resurrection in Christian theology, providing a comprehensive list of relevant Bible verses that support the idea of Jesus' physical resurrection from the dead. The inclusion of passages from various books of the New Testament, including Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Paul's epistles, shows a good grasp of the biblical narrative surrounding resurrection.

The response also highlights the importance of resurrection as a central doctrine in Christian faith, emphasizing its connection to God's power and sovereignty over life and death. The mention of early Church writings, such as 1 Clement and 2 Clement, adds depth and historical context to the discussion.

However, the response could be improved by providing more analysis and reflection on the significance of the verses cited. While the list is comprehensive, it would be helpful to see some commentary on how these passages relate to each other and to the broader Christian understanding of resurrection.

Overall, this response demonstrates a strong commitment to grounding beliefs in Scripture, which aligns with the concern mentioned earlier.
