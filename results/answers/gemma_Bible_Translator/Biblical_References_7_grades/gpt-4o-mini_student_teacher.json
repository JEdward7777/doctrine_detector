  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a good selection of Bible references highlighting the significance of the Sabbath in Christian faith. However, the answer could be improved by including additional key references like Exodus 31:14, Mark 2:27, and Isaiah 56:6-7, as suggested in the teacher's reference answer. These references specifically address the command to observe the Sabbath and its purpose in the Christian faith, providing a more comprehensive and focused answer."
