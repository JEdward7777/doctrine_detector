  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student has provided a well-researched and comprehensive list of Bible references that highlight the significance of the Sabbath. The references are relevant and support the concern of identifying scriptural backing for the Sabbath observance in Christian faith. However, the student could have included more analysis or interpretation of the references to enhance the overall quality of the response."
