Comment: The response provided a solid foundation by citing relevant Bible references highlighting the significance of the Sabbath observance within the Christian faith. The inclusion of additional references like Exodus 31:14, Mark 2:27, and Isaiah 56:6-7 would have further enriched the argument, but the references cited effectively support the importance of Sabbath observance based on a Christian worldview.
