  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses related to ransom and redemption and has effectively explained how they contribute to the understanding of redemption. They have correctly highlighted the key aspects of redemption as a costly, deliberate, and substitutionary act for the benefit of others, and tied it to Christ's ultimate sacrifice. The student also goes beyond the given verses to include additional theological considerations, showing a deeper engagement with the topic. However, their answer could benefit from incorporating the specific verses referenced by the teacher to fully align with the concern of exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption."
