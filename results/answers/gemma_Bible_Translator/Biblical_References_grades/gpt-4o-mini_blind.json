  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept of covenant faithfulness both in the Old and New Testaments. They have provided appropriate Bible verses to support their points and highlighted key concepts like God's faithfulness, human faithfulness, grace, and obedience. The analysis of covenant faithfulness as a relationship with God and how it is not about legalistic obedience is well articulated. The only area for improvement would be to include a bit more depth or explanation in some of the key concepts to further enhance the response."
