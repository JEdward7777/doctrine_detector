They also highlighted key concepts related to covenant faithfulness and provided additional considerations. However, the student missed specific references (Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18) that were mentioned by the teacher as crucial examples of covenant faithfulness in the Bible. Encouraging the student to ensure they include all specific references provided in the question for a more comprehensive answer."
