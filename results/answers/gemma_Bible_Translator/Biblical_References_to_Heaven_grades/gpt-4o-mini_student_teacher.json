  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses that offer insight into the concept of heaven. They have covered general concepts, the nature of heaven, experiences in heaven, and key themes associated with heaven. The inclusion of additional notes on interpretation and the importance of context shows a deeper reflection on the topic. However, the student could improve by incorporating some of the key verses mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher to further enhance their understanding of the concept of heaven."
