  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. They correctly identified key passages in both the Old and New Testaments that reference the Festival of Weeks/Pentecost and explained their significance effectively. The additional references provided further enriched the answer. However, the student missed mentioning 2 Chronicles in their response, as stated in the reference answer from the teacher."
