**Old Testament:**

* **Numbers 28:16-31:** Describes the establishment of the Festival of Weeks as a seven-week celebration following the harvest of barley.
* **Deuteronomy 16:9-10:** Explains the significance of the Festival of Weeks as a time of rejoicing and offering sacrifices to God.

**New Testament:**

* **Acts 2:** Describes the first Pentecost celebration after Jesus' ascension, where the Holy Spirit descended and empowered the early church.
* **1 Corinthians 15:29:** References the resurrection of Jesus on the eighth day after Pentecost.
* **Revelation 21:24:** Mentions the eternal celebration of Pentecost in heaven.

**Additional references:**

* **Psalm 65:3:** Hints at the connection between the Festival of Weeks and the outpouring of God's blessing.
