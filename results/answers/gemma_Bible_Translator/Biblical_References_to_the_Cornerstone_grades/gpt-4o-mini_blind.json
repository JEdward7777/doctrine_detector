  "grade_comment": "Grade: 87\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses referencing Jesus as the cornerstone and has accurately conveyed various aspects of His role in Christianity. The explanation of Jesus' role as the cornerstone is well summarized and supported by the selected verses. However, there is room for improvement in terms of connecting each verse more directly to the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of Jesus as the cornerstone could enhance the answer further."
