  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained list of Bible verses referencing Jesus as the cornerstone and effectively conveyed His role in the believer's faith. The response showcases a deep understanding of the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in Christian theology. However, the student missed including Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22 specifically referenced in the teacher's answer, which slightly detracts from the overall accuracy of the response. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong grasp of the topic and effectively connected the verses to Jesus' foundational role in the Christian faith."
