The additional insights further enhance the understanding of God's greatness and significance. The only slight drawback is the limited inclusion of the verses provided in the response. Otherwise, the response effectively addresses the concern raised, guiding Christians to appreciate the depth of God's sovereignty as portrayed in Scripture."
