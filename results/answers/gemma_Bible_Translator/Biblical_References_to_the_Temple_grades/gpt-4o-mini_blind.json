  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComments: The student provided an adequate list of scriptures that refer to the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" from both the Old and New Testaments. However, there could be more depth added to the explanation of the significance and symbolism of the temple as the dwelling place of God's presence. Additionally, the student could have included scriptures like 1 Kings 6:1 or 2 Chronicles 3:1 for more comprehensive coverage."
