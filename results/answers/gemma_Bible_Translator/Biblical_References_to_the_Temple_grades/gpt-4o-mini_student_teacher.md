## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Several scriptures in the Bible refer to the temple as the "house of Yahweh":

**Old Testament:**

* **Psalm 133:** "The Lord is good; his faithfulness endures forever. He will bless his house and his dwelling place."
* **Psalm 21:6:** "My lips will glorify the Lord. His praise will be heard in his house and throughout his halls."
* **Nehemiah 1:9:** "We are servants to the Lord our God, and we are fulfilling his commands. He has given us strength and enabled us to build his house."
* **Haggai 2:7:** "Remember the former days, when you prayed to the Lord in this place? I indeed recall them and now I am restoring it."

**New Testament:**

* **Hebrews 3:10:** "But Christ is faithful as a son over God, and he will uphold his house forever."

These scriptures highlight the temple as a physical structure where God's presence resided and where worship and prayer took place.

Grade: 80

Comment: 
The student provided relevant scriptures from both the Old and New Testament that mention the temple as the "house of Yahweh," showing a good understanding of the concept. However, the reference answer includes specific verses that directly address the temple as the "house of Yahweh." Encouraging the student to include these key verses would enhance the completeness of the response.
