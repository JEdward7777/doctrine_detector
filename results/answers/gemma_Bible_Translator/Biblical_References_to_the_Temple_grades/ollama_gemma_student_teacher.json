  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student has provided a comprehensive and accurate compilation of scriptures that refer to the temple as the \"house of Yahweh.\" They correctly identified both Old and New Testament passages, offering relevant verses from both testaments. The student's interpretation of the scriptures clearly highlights the physical structure of the temple and its significance as a place where God's presence resided and worship occurred. While the response lacks additional analysis or theological interpretation, it effectively addresses the concern by identifying key scriptures related to the concept of the temple as God's house."
