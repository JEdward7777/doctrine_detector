  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of identifying key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house, particularly in the Old Testament. The provided scriptures (Psalm 133, Psalm 21:6, Nehemiah 1:9, and Haggai 2:7) effectively demonstrate how the temple was considered the \"house of Yahweh\" where God's presence resided and where worship and prayer took place.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have also included relevant New Testament scriptures that discuss the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\", such as Hebrews 3:10. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to provide more context or explanation about why these specific scriptures are important for understanding the concept of the temple as God's house.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some useful biblical references to support its claims, but could be improved by including more comprehensive coverage of both Old and New Testament scriptures."
