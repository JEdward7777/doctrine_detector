## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Several scriptures in the Bible refer to the temple as the "house of Yahweh":

**Old Testament:**

* **Psalm 133:** "The Lord is good; his faithfulness endures forever. He will bless his house and his dwelling place."
* **Psalm 21:6:** "My lips will glorify the Lord. His praise will be heard in his house and throughout his halls."
* **Nehemiah 1:9:** "We are servants to the Lord our God, and we are fulfilling his commands. He has given us strength and enabled us to build his house."
* **Haggai 2:7:** "Remember the former days, when you prayed to the Lord in this place? I indeed recall them and now I am restoring it."

**New Testament:**

* **Hebrews 3:10:** "But Christ is faithful as a son over God, and he will uphold his house forever."

These scriptures highlight the temple as a physical structure where God's presence resided and where worship and prayer took place.
