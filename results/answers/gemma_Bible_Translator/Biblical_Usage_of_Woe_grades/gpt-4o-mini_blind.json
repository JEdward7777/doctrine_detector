The references provided are relevant and support the interpretation well. The analysis of 'woe' in relation to human sin, material wealth, religious hypocrisy, and divine judgment is doctrinally sound. The note on interpreting the Bible within its historical and literary context is a valuable addition. Great job overall!"
