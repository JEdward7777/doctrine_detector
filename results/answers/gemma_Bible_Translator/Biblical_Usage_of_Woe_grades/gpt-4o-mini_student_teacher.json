  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples of 'woe' in the Bible and successfully connected them to themes of human sinfulness, materialism, religious hypocrisy, and divine judgment. The interpretation of 'woe' and its implications for God's judgment were well explained. However, the student missed including references from Ezekiel and Habakkuk as provided in the reference answer. Incorporating these additional examples would have further strengthened the answer and led to a higher grade."
