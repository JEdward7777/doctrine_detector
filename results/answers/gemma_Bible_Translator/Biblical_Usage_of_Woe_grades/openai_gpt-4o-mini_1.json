  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of 'woe' in the Bible, citing relevant examples and interpretations. It effectively connects the theme of divine judgment to human sinfulness, materialism, religious hypocrisy, and global wickedness. The response also acknowledges the importance of interpreting the Bible within its historical and literary context. The only critique would be to provide more direct analysis of the severity of divine judgment expressed in the selected passages."
