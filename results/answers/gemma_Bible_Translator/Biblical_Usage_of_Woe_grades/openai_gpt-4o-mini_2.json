  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough examination of the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. The examples given demonstrate a clear understanding of how 'woe' is used to emphasize severe judgment upon those who sin or lead others astray. The interpretation and explanation provided align well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the consequences of human sin, materialism, religious hypocrisy, and divine judgment. The response effectively communicates the gravity of God's judgment in the context of the Bible."
