  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the figurative uses of the term \"Zion\" in the Bible. The explanations are well-supported with relevant biblical references and demonstrate a good understanding of the concept. However, to improve the grade, the student could further elaborate on the theological significance and deeper spiritual implications of each figurative use of Zion. Additionally, incorporating more Old Testament references along with New Testament ones would provide a more balanced perspective. Overall, a solid effort with room for further depth and insight."
