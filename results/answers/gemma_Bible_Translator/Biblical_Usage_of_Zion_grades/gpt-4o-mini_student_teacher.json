  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful exploration of the figurative uses of the term \"Zion\" in the Bible, demonstrating a solid understanding of its spiritual and symbolic implications in Christian theology. The student effectively elaborated on various dimensions such as spiritual triumphalism, God's people, spiritual mountain, purity, holiness, and God's reign, aligning well with the broader spiritual meanings of 'Zion' in Christian belief. However, the reference answer from the teacher brings a deeper nuance by emphasizing how 'Zion' is not just limited to Jerusalem but extends to Israel, God's spiritual kingdom, and the future heavenly Jerusalem, which the student did not explicitly address. This slight oversight is the reason for a slightly lower grade."
