  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 50.\n\nWhile it is important to respect Christian theological beliefs, in this case, the student could have provided a general historical or archaeological perspective on the materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times without going against Christian beliefs. Even without explicit biblical references, historical context could have been drawn upon. By not providing any information at all, the student missed an opportunity to enhance their understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship."
