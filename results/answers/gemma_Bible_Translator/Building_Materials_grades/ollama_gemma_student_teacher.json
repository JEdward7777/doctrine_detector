  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the limitations of their knowledge base within the context of Christian theology. However, they could have elaborated on the importance of interpreting biblical practices within their historical and cultural contexts, even if the construction of altars is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible. The reference answer provides additional information that could have been included in the student's response to enhance its comprehensiveness."
