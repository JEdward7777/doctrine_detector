However, the concern raised regarding deepening understanding of biblical practices and reverence in worship is valid, and the original response fell short in addressing this aspect through a Christian worldview perspective. Although the response acknowledged the lack of explicit biblical mention of altar construction, it could have emphasized how knowledge of altars could enhance Christians' appreciation of Old Testament practices and the significance of worship rituals in biblical times."
