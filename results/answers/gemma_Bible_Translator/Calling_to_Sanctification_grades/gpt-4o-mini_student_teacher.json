  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer to the question, incorporating specific Bible verses that emphasize the importance of personal sanctification. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview, highlighting the essential elements of obedience to God's Word, submission to the Holy Spirit, growth in Christlikeness, ongoing transformation, and the daily pursuit of holiness. The only area for improvement would be to directly state the command to believers regarding their personal sanctification, as mentioned in the reference answer, to fully address the question."
