  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides some good biblical support for the importance of personal responsibility in sanctification, particularly in the first point \"Obedience to God's Word\" where it quotes Romans 12:2 and 1 Peter 1:15 emphasizing the need for believers to be transformed and sanctified themselves. The second point \"Submission to the Holy Spirit\" also highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification, which is crucial for ongoing transformation.\n\nHowever, the response could have emphasized more strongly the importance of personal responsibility throughout all five points, rather than just mentioning it briefly in the first point. Additionally, while the quotes provided are relevant, they could have been applied more explicitly to the concept of personal responsibility in sanctification.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could have further developed the theme of personal responsibility by providing more explicit examples and biblical support throughout all five points, rather than just mentioning it briefly."
