Grade: 95

Comment: The response clearly embraces the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process, aligning with Christian teachings on the believer's role in pursuing holiness. The elaboration provided with scriptural references effectively emphasizes the commands for Christians to persevere in personal sanctification through obedience, submission to the Holy Spirit, growth in Christlikeness, ongoing transformation, and daily pursuit of holiness. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly mention the need for believers to actively engage in these practices as part of their personal responsibility in sanctification.
