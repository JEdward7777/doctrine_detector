It effectively addresses the concern regarding the nature of faith and authority in Jesus' ministry, drawing theological implications and highlighting the significance of genuine faith in experiencing God's power. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps include a bit more scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a strong and well-articulated response."
