The student effectively ties in key theological themes such as the humanity and divinity of Jesus, the power of His sacrifice, the universality of salvation, and God's judgment and mercy. The inclusion of different interpretations of the centurion's reaction adds depth to the analysis. The suggestions on what Christians can learn from the centurion's example are also insightful. Overall, a solid response that demonstrates a good understanding of the implications of the centurion's reaction in Christian theology."
