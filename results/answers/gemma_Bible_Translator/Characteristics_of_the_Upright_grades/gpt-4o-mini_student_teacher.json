  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained list of qualities that define an 'upright' person in the biblical context. The examples given from biblical characters help to illustrate these qualities effectively. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes obedience to God's laws, moral purity, and living a God-pleasing life as the key defining qualities of an 'upright' person. Integrating these core principles more prominently in the response would strengthen the alignment with the Christian worldview."
