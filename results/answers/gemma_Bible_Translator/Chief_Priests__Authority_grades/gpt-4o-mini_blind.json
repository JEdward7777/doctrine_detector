  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the relationship between the chief priests and the ordinary priests in terms of authority within a Christian worldview. The student effectively highlights the hierarchical structure, differences in status, mutual dependence, and provides relevant scriptural references to support their points. The only aspect that could have enhanced the response further would be a deeper engagement with Christian theological concepts related to priesthood and leadership within the context of the Old Testament. Overall, a strong and informative answer."
