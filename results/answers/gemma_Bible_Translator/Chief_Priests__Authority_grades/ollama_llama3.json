The supporting biblical references (Exodus 40:14 and Exodus 28:38-39) add credibility to the argument.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more nuance and detail about the nature of this hierarchical structure. For example, it would have been helpful to explore how this structure was influenced by biblical teachings or cultural norms of the time.\n\nAdditionally, while the response does acknowledge the high priest's greater authority, it could have benefited from a deeper analysis of what this meant in practice, particularly in terms of decision-making and governance within the Temple."
