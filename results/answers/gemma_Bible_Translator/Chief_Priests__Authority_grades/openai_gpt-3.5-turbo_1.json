  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and accurate depiction of the hierarchical structure and relationship between the chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Israel. It effectively expands on the roles, responsibilities, status differences, and mutual dependence within the priesthood. The inclusion of scriptural references further supports the explanation from a Christian worldview perspective. However, the response could have further emphasized the spiritual significance and biblical principles underlying the leadership structure to enhance the Christian perspective."
