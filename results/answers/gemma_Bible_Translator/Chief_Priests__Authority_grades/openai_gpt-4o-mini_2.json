The answer effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the roles, responsibilities, differences in status, mutual dependence, and scriptural references related to this structure. The inclusion of scriptural references adds a Christian worldview perspective to the analysis. Overall, the response demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic and presents the information clearly and comprehensively."
