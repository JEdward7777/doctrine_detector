  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the term 'Christ' in the New Testament, highlighting key aspects such as its connection to Messianic prophecies, early church usage, and development of theological understanding. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by focusing more on the deepened understanding of Jesus's identity and purpose through the significance of the title 'Christ', as specified in the concern. Emphasizing how the title 'Christ' emphasizes Jesus's divine appointment as the Savior would have aligned better with the Christian worldview."
