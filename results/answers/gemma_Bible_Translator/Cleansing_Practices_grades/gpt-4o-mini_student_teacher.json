  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and thoughtful response to the question, offering practical and relevant suggestions for modern Christians to reflect the concept of ritual cleanliness from the Old Testament. The emphasis on purity of heart, observance of ritual practices, maintaining physical cleanliness, and purity in daily life align well with the concern of enhancing spiritual growth and accountability. The student also considers important factors such as the cultural context of Old Testament rituals and the need to avoid legalism. The only recommendation would be to more directly tie the practices suggested to the concept of repentance, confession, and spiritual discipline as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer."
