## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response effectively incorporates the concern of incorporating ancient teachings into contemporary faith practice, and it does so in a way that is thoughtful and biblically grounded. The writer provides specific examples of modern practices that can be used to symbolize and seek a state of moral and spiritual cleanliness, such as repentance, confession, and spiritual discipline.

The response also acknowledges the importance of understanding the cultural and historical context of ancient rituals, and it encourages readers to study Old Testament passages on ritual cleanliness to gain a deeper understanding of their significance. This suggests that the writer is aware of the need to adapt ancient teachings to modern contexts, and they are willing to do the necessary work to make this happen.

The one area where the response falls short is in its lack of concrete examples or practical suggestions for how individuals can put these principles into practice. While the writer provides some general ideas, such as engaging in contemplative practices or consulting with theologians, it would be helpful to see more specific and actionable steps that readers can take.

Overall, however, this response is well-written, thoughtful, and biblically grounded, and it effectively addresses the concern of incorporating ancient teachings into contemporary faith practice.
