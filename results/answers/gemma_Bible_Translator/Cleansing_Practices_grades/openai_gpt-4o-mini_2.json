It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of incorporating ancient teachings for spiritual growth and accountability in contemporary faith practices. The suggestions for further study and consultation with theologians show a commitment to deepening understanding and application. The only area for potential improvement could be further connecting these practices explicitly to Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of spiritual cleanliness for Christians."
