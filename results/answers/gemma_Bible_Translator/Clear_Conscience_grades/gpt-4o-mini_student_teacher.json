  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of what it means to have a clear conscience in the context of Christian teachings, emphasizing alignment with God's Word, integrity, accountability, and peace. However, the answer strays from the core biblical concept of having a clear conscience as being free from hidden sin and in obedience to God. While the student's points are valuable in understanding the broader implications of a clear conscience, the lack of focus on the fundamental aspect of sin and obedience lowers the grade."
