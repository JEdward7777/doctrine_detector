  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical figures along with specific scenarios demonstrating compassion. They also included relevant biblical principles related to compassion. However, the student missed including examples like Daniel's refusal to defile himself and Hosea's love for an unfaithful spouse as mentioned in the reference answer. Incorporating these additional examples would have strengthened the overall response."
