  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 and effectively applies them to the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. They offer insightful reflections on the importance of love, forgiveness, and God's compassion in response to wrongdoing. However, the student's answer could be improved by connecting more directly with the reference answer provided by the teacher, demonstrating a deeper integration with the Christian perspective on punishment and condemnation."
