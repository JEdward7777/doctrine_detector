## [Answer](../Condemnation_and_Punishment.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
## Matthew 12:7

**Context:**

> "You have heard it said, 'Do not murder,' but I tell you, anyone who insults his brother or sister is guilty of murder."

**Implications for punishment:**

* This verse emphasizes the importance of love and forgiveness in our relationships with others.
* It suggests that verbal insults, which can deeply wound others, carry significant spiritual consequences.
* While physical punishment may be warranted in certain situations, it should never be the primary response to conflict or wrongdoing.


## Psalms 34:22

**Context:**

> "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."

**Implications for punishment:**

* This verse highlights God's compassion and care for those who are suffering.
* It emphasizes that punishment should never be seen as God's primary means of retribution.
* Rather, God's love and forgiveness are always available to those who repent and seek his grace.


**Harmonizing the two passages:**

These two passages teach us that:

* **Punishment is not the ultimate goal of justice.** God's ultimate desire is to save and redeem people, not to punish them.
* **True justice involves both punishment and forgiveness.** Justice demands that wrongdoing be addressed, but it also requires that forgiveness be offered to those who repent.
* **Christian responses to punishment should always prioritize love and forgiveness.** We are called to love others as Christ loved us, even when they have wronged us.

**Therefore, our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation should be nuanced and balanced. While punishment may be necessary in certain circumstances, it should never be seen as the ultimate solution. Ultimately, God's love and forgiveness are the most powerful tools for bringing about justice and reconciliation.**
