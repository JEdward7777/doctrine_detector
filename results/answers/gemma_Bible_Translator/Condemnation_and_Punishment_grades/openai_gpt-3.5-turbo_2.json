  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the given passages in light of the concern about balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. It effectively integrates the teachings of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 to emphasize the importance of love, forgiveness, and redemption in the context of punishment. The harmonization of these passages reflects a Christian worldview that values both justice and mercy, ultimately highlighting the transformative power of God's love and forgiveness in addressing wrongdoing. The only room for improvement would be to further elaborate on specific examples or practical applications of how this balanced perspective on punishment can be lived out in daily life."
