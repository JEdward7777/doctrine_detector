  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the theological implications of confession and belief in salvation, grounded in Paul's writings. It effectively highlights the significance of confessing Jesus as Lord in relation to recognizing His deity, submitting to His authority, and accepting His sacrifice for sin. The response appropriately emphasizes the importance of salvation being a gift of grace received through faith in Christ, not based on works. Well-done in addressing the concern with a solid Christian perspective."
