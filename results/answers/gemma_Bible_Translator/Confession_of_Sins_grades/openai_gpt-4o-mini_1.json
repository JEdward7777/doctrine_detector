It also aligns well with the Christian worldview by referencing relevant Bible verses and providing practical steps for living a life pleasing to God. The only minor improvement could be to directly quote a Bible verse about the importance of confessing sin for forgiveness to further reinforce the connection between acknowledging sin and receiving God's forgiveness."
