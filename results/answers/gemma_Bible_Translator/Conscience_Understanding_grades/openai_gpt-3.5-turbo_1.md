## Biblical Definition of Conscience

The Bible offers several insights into the concept of conscience. It's primarily seen as:

**1. An internal judgment:**

* "For we know that the judgment of God is upon the secrets of our hearts: for we shall all stand before the throne of judgment to give an account for ourselves." (Romans 2:16)
* "But I will keep under my skin for your sakes: for I know that in the judgment of God the secrets of the heart will be revealed." (1 Corinthians 4:5)

**2. A moral faculty:**

* "Whoever rejects conscience is without excuse." (Romans 2:15)
* "If anyone does not obey the law of the land, the law of God is written in his heart." (Romans 2:13)

**3. A spiritual awareness:**

* "Be clear in your conscience, and do not be ashamed." (2 Timothy 1:13)
* "For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should grow in the work of faith and love." (Ephesians 6:10)


## Function in Christian Beliefs

Within Christian beliefs, conscience is understood as:

* **A gift from God:** Our conscience is not simply an innate human trait, but a divine endowment. 
* **A tool for discerning right and wrong:** It guides us in understanding God's law and applying it to our lives.
* **A test of faith:** True faith involves aligning our actions with our convictions of right and wrong, as revealed by our conscience. 
* **A basis for accountability:** Our actions will be judged by God based on the integrity of our conscience.

Therefore, cultivating and nurturing a strong conscience is seen as an essential aspect of Christian living.
