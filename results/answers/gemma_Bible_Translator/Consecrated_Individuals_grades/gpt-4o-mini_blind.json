  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This is a well-organized and informative response that provides a good overview of individuals consecrated to God in the Bible. The student accurately references various passages and examples. One minor improvement could be to focus more on explaining the spiritual significance and purpose of consecration in each case, linking it back to God's sovereignty and plan. Overall, a solid and well-researched answer."
