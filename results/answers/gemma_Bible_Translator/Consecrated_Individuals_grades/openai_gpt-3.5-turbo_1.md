Several individuals mentioned in the Bible were consecrated to God in various ways. Here are a few examples:

**1. The Levitical Priests:**
* God consecrated the Levites from the tribe of Levi to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple as priests (Exodus 30:22-28, Leviticus 10:7-8).
* Their ordination involved ritual purification and the anointing of priests with oil (Exodus 29:7).

**2. The Prophets:**
* Certain prophets were consecrated to God for specific tasks. 
* For example, Samuel was consecrated as a prophet before he became a judge and military leader (1 Samuel 1-3).
* Others, like Elijah and Elisha, were called by God and underwent specific training and preparation.

**3. King David:**
* David was consecrated to God as the anointed king of Israel (1 Samuel 16:1-13).
* His ordination involved symbolic acts like the sacrifice of two young goats (1 Samuel 16:3-4).

**4. The Apostles:**
* While not explicitly consecrated in the Bible, the apostles were set apart by the Holy Spirit for the specific task of spreading the Gospel (Acts 1:8).
* Their commissioning involved prayer and the laying on of hands (Acts 1:5).

**5. Others:**
* Various other individuals in the Bible were consecrated to God in unique ways. 
* For example, the Widow of Sarep (2 Kings 4) was consecrated to caring for the prophet Elisha.
* The four horsemen of the Apocalypse (Revelation 6) were consecrated to perform specific tasks during the end times.

It's important to note that the concept of ordination or consecration varies across different traditions and interpretations of the Bible.
