  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how consecration prepares individuals or things for God's service, covering various aspects such as setting apart, purification, alignment with God's standards, enhancing spiritual significance, and preparation for God's glory. The biblical examples provided further support the points made. However, the student could focus more on the aspect of cleansing and making things acceptable for service to God, as highlighted in the reference answer. This additional emphasis would have further strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective. Overall, a well-developed and insightful answer."
