## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The biblical account of the Ark of the Covenant does not provide extensive details regarding the specific items contained within it. However, traditional interpretations suggest that the ark held:

* **The Tabernacle furniture:** This would include the golden altar, the lampstand, the table of shewbread, and the curtain of the tent of meeting.
* **Sacrificial materials:** These would likely include various types of grain and animal sacrifices.
* **The covenant covenant:** This would include the two tablets of the Law, representing God's covenant with his people.
* **Other sacred objects:** Some interpretations also suggest the inclusion of items like the jar of manna and the pot of incense.

It's important to note that these interpretations are not explicitly stated in the biblical text, but are inferences drawn from the broader context and traditions surrounding the Ark.
