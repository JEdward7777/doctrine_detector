The acknowledgment that these interpretations are not explicitly stated in the biblical text is also commendable. However, it's important to emphasize the centrality of the two tablets of the Law as the primary contents representing God's covenant, which could have been highlighted further for doctrinal correctness. Additionally, the response could have benefited from referencing specific biblical passages or sources that mention these items for a more comprehensive answer."
