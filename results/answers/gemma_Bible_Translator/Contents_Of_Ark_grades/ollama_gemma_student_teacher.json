  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the potential contents of the Ark of the Covenant. They correctly point out the lack of explicit textual information and rely on traditional interpretations and broader context to suggest possible items. Their inclusion of the two tablets of the Law and the jar of manna aligns with the reference answer, while the mention of Aaron's staff adds an additional element not included in the official response. While the answer lacks the pinpoint accuracy of the reference response, it offers a broader and more comprehensive analysis."
