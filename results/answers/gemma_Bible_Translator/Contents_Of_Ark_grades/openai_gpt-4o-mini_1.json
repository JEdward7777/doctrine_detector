  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 90. The response provides additional insights into possible contents of the Ark of the Covenant beyond the specific items mentioned in the initial answer. The explanation aligns well with the concern of learning about the reminders of God's covenant with the Israelites and offers a broader perspective on this topic. The response acknowledges that these interpretations are not explicitly stated in the biblical text, which shows humility and awareness of potential limitations in understanding. Overall, it enriches the discussion with relevant details and reinforces the theme of God's covenant with His people in the biblical context."
