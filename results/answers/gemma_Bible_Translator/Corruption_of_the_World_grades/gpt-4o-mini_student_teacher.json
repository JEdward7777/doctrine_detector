  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and detailed response outlining various ways Christians can identify corrupt influences in the world around them. The suggestions cover a wide range of areas like cultural influences, social media, politics, economics, education, personal experiences, and seeking spiritual guidance. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused on directly comparing behaviors and attitudes to biblical teachings, as highlighted in the reference answer. Some suggestions may also benefit from more explicitly linking back to the concern of remaining vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living."
