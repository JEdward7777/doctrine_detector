The suggestions for examining various aspects of culture, media, politics, economics, education, artifacts, traditions, personal beliefs, and seeking spiritual guidance are detailed and practical. The only improvement could be to emphasize the importance of prayer and reliance on God's guidance even more throughout the process."
