  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, supported by relevant Biblical references. The distinctions between the two types of covenants were clearly explained. The explanation of the conditional covenants, such as the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Law, was doctrinally sound. However, the portrayal of the Covenant of Grace as conditional based on accepting Jesus Christ as Lord could be further clarified to emphasize God's free gift of salvation through faith alone. Similarly, while the Unconditional Covenants were generally well-presented, emphasizing the covenantal aspect of these relationships with God could enhance the theological depth of the response."
