  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, showing a good understanding of the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants from a Christian worldview. They correctly identified examples of both types of covenants and supported their points with relevant biblical references. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of obedience in conditional covenants and the gracious nature of God's unconditional covenants, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
