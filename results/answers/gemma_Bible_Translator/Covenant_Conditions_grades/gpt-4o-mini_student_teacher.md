## Question [Covenant Conditions](../../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)
What are some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible?

## Correct Answer
An example of an unconditional covenant is God's promise to never destroy the earth again with a flood. In contrast, conditional covenants require obedience from the people, such as the covenant at Sinai where God said, 'If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant...'

## Stated Concern
Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

## [Answer](../Covenant_Conditions.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
## Conditional Covens:

**1. The Covenant of Works:**

- God promised Adam and subsequent generations blessing and life if they obeyed God's laws perfectly.
- This covenant was conditional on perfect obedience, which humanity could not fulfill.
- Hebrews 9:23 says this covenant was "set aside" because it was based on human merit rather than God's grace.

**2. The Conditional Covenant of Law:**

- God gave the Ten Commandments and other laws to Moses as a way of restoring the Israelites to him after their idolatry.
- This covenant required strict adherence to the law for blessing and forgiveness.
- However, Jesus fulfilled this covenant by offering himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin.

**3. The Conditional Covenant of Grace:**

- God promises salvation and eternal life to those who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
- This covenant requires faith in Jesus, which is a gift from God.
- Romans 10:9 states that "salvation is not based on works, but on faith in Jesus Christ."


## Unconditional Covens:

**1. The Covenant of Creation:**

- God created the world out of nothing, demonstrating his unlimited power and sovereignty.
- This covenant is unconditional, as God's creation reflects his character and purposes.

**2. The Covenant of Redemption:**

- God promised to redeem the world from sin through the birth of Jesus Christ.
- This covenant is unconditional, as it is based on God's love for humanity, not on any merit or actions of people.

**3. The New Covenant:**

- God promises a new covenant in the hearts of believers, where his Spirit writes his laws on their hearts.
- This covenant is unconditional, as it is available to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord.

**Key Principles:**

- The Bible teaches both conditional and unconditional covenants.
- Conditional covenants are often temporary and lead to transgression, while unconditional covenants are permanent and restorative.
- God's love and mercy are always unconditional, while our response to him can be conditional.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, showing a good understanding of the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants from a Christian worldview. They correctly identified examples of both types of covenants and supported their points with relevant biblical references. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of obedience in conditional covenants and the gracious nature of God's unconditional covenants, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer.
