## Question [Covenant Conditions](../../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)

## Conditional Covens:

**1. The Covenant of Works:**

- God promised Adam and subsequent generations blessing and life if they obeyed God's laws perfectly.
- This covenant was conditional on perfect obedience, which humanity could not fulfill.
- Hebrews 9:23 says this covenant was "set aside" because it was based on human merit rather than God's grace.

**2. The Conditional Covenant of Law:**

- God gave the Ten Commandments and other laws to Moses as a way of restoring the Israelites to him after their idolatry.
- This covenant required strict adherence to the law for blessing and forgiveness.
- However, Jesus fulfilled this covenant by offering himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin.

**3. The Conditional Covenant of Grace:**

- God promises salvation and eternal life to those who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
- This covenant requires faith in Jesus, which is a gift from God.
- Romans 10:9 states that "salvation is not based on works, but on faith in Jesus Christ."


## Unconditional Covens:

**1. The Covenant of Creation:**

- God created the world out of nothing, demonstrating his unlimited power and sovereignty.
- This covenant is unconditional, as God's creation reflects his character and purposes.

**2. The Covenant of Redemption:**

- God promised to redeem the world from sin through the birth of Jesus Christ.
- This covenant is unconditional, as it is based on God's love for humanity, not on any merit or actions of people.

**3. The New Covenant:**

- God promises a new covenant in the hearts of believers, where his Spirit writes his laws on their hearts.
- This covenant is unconditional, as it is available to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord.

**Key Principles:**

- The Bible teaches both conditional and unconditional covenants.
- Conditional covenants are often temporary and lead to transgression, while unconditional covenants are permanent and restorative.
- God's love and mercy are always unconditional, while our response to him can be conditional.
