# Question [Covenant Conditions](../../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)
What are some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible?

# Correct Answer
An example of an unconditional covenant is God's promise to never destroy the earth again with a flood. In contrast, conditional covenants require obedience from the people, such as the covenant at Sinai where God said, 'If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant...'

# Stated Concern
Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

## Conditional Covens:

**1. The Covenant of Works:**

- God promised Adam and subsequent generations blessing and life if they obeyed God's laws perfectly.
- This covenant was conditional on perfect obedience, which humanity could not fulfill.
- Hebrews 9:23 says this covenant was "set aside" because it was based on human merit rather than God's grace.

**2. The Conditional Covenant of Law:**

- God gave the Ten Commandments and other laws to Moses as a way of restoring the Israelites to him after their idolatry.
- This covenant required strict adherence to the law for blessing and forgiveness.
- However, Jesus fulfilled this covenant by offering himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin.

**3. The Conditional Covenant of Grace:**

- God promises salvation and eternal life to those who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
- This covenant requires faith in Jesus, which is a gift from God.
- Romans 10:9 states that "salvation is not based on works, but on faith in Jesus Christ."


## Unconditional Covens:

**1. The Covenant of Creation:**

- God created the world out of nothing, demonstrating his unlimited power and sovereignty.
- This covenant is unconditional, as God's creation reflects his character and purposes.

**2. The Covenant of Redemption:**

- God promised to redeem the world from sin through the birth of Jesus Christ.
- This covenant is unconditional, as it is based on God's love for humanity, not on any merit or actions of people.

**3. The New Covenant:**

- God promises a new covenant in the hearts of believers, where his Spirit writes his laws on their hearts.
- This covenant is unconditional, as it is available to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord.

**Key Principles:**

- The Bible teaches both conditional and unconditional covenants.
- Conditional covenants are often temporary and lead to transgression, while unconditional covenants are permanent and restorative.
- God's love and mercy are always unconditional, while our response to him can be conditional.

I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a clear and detailed overview of different types of covenants in the Bible, including conditional and unconditional ones. It also correctly identifies God's love and mercy as always being unconditional, while human responses to him can be conditional. The explanation is well-organized and easy to follow.

However, the response does not explicitly address the concern of understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants, which was specified. While it mentions that conditional covenants require obedience and that unconditional covenants are permanent and restorative, it could have delved deeper into how these dynamics play out in different contexts.

The example provided at the beginning is not directly addressed in the response, but it does fit with the broader discussion of conditional and unconditional covenants. To take the concern more seriously, the response could have explored the implications of God's promise to never destroy the earth again with a flood for understanding his promises and expectations in other contexts.

Overall, while the response is strong in its presentation of biblical concepts, it could be even stronger by explicitly addressing the concern and exploring the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.
