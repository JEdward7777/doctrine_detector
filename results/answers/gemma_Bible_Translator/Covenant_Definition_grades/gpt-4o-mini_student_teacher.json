  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful explanation of the Biblical definition of a covenant, including key components, examples, principles, and implications. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the nature of covenants in biblical contexts. The answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, but the student could further enhance their response by connecting each biblical example of a covenant to specific passages or stories in the Bible to strengthen their argument from a Christian perspective."
