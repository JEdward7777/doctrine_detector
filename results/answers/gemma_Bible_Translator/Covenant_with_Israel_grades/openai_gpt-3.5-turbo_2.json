It recognizes the importance of God's promises and relationship with His chosen people through the covenant, connecting it to the broader biblical narrative and the fulfillment in Jesus Christ. However, the specific concern about the Israelites being God's chosen people could have been directly addressed within the explanation of the covenant's nature to further emphasize this key aspect of the relationship."
