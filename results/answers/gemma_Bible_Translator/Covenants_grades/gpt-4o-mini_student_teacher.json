  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-organized answer that effectively explains how the promises made in biblical covenants demonstrate God's commitment to His people. They have discussed key covenants such as the Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and New Covenants, highlighting the themes of faithfulness, grace, and love. The student also appropriately addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of God's promises throughout Scripture. However, the answer could be strengthened by more specifically referencing the continuity across generations as seen in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
