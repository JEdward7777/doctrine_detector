The application of this biblical concept to believers is clear and relevant, stressing the need to live in obedience out of love and gratitude for God's grace. The additional consideration of curses as a means of restoration rather than just punishment aligns well with a Christian worldview focused on redemption and reconciliation through Jesus Christ."
