  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the significance of the snake's curse in Genesis 3:14, connecting it effectively to sin and redemption within Christian theology. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the broader theological implications and effectively ties the curse to the need for redemption through Christ. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the teacher's specific answer to show a clearer alignment with the concern provided."
