The answer effectively connects the curse to the symbolism of Satan, the reflection of human sin, the hope in redemption through Christ, the demonstration of God's justice and mercy, and the ultimate victory over sin and death. The explanation is well-supported and demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian theology. Great job overall!"
