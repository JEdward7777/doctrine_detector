The points made align well with biblical teachings on humility, sacrifice, commitment, obedience, carrying the burden of sin, endurance, suffering, and living for others. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the centrality of Christ's atoning sacrifice on the cross in enabling believers to take up their crosses daily and follow Him."
