It aligns well with the concern of emphasizing the call to discipleship and the personal cost of following Christ by emphasizing humility, sacrifice, commitment, obedience, carrying the burden of sin, endurance, suffering, and living for others. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate example of taking up the cross, although it is subtly implied throughout the response."
