  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the promise of David's throne lasting forever in Christian theology. They supported their response with relevant biblical references, interpretations, and implications, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic. However, the answer could have been improved by directly stating that the promise's fulfillment is realized through Jesus' eternal kingship, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful response."
