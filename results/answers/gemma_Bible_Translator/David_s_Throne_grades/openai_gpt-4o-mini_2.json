It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus as the ultimate descendant of David. The interpretation is supported by relevant biblical references, and the significance section clearly articulates the theological implications of this promise. The understanding section successfully highlights the spiritual dimensions of this promise beyond its historical context. Overall, this response demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
