They effectively addressed the specific concern by explaining the significance and implications of this concept for believers, incorporating both future events and present spiritual realities. The incorporation of biblical references further strengthens their answer. Overall, a well-thought-out and thorough response, only slightly deviating from the reference answer with additional depth."
