It not only addresses the future aspect of Christ's Second Coming and judgment but also highlights the present spiritual reality of the Holy Spirit's transformative power in believers' lives. The biblical references support the interpretation well. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include some additional verses that highlight the urgency and importance of being prepared for the \"day of the Lord\" as a call to action for believers."
