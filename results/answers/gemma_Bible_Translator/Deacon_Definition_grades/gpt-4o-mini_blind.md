Comment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the primary role of a deacon in the local church, supported by relevant biblical references. The student effectively outlines the practical and spiritual responsibilities of deacons, emphasizing the importance of serving with humility, love, and faithfulness. However, to enhance the response, the student could have expounded further on the biblical significance of deacons serving as servants of the church under the authority of the elders. Additionally, reinforcing the aspect of deacons being servant-leaders who demonstrate Christ-like character in all aspects of their service would have strengthened the answer.
