  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer outlining the practical and spiritual responsibilities of a deacon in the local church. They made good connections to biblical references and emphasized the importance of serving others in embodying the love of Christ. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the direct biblical role of servanthood in the church, as the teacher's reference answer highlights the practical aspect of helping with needs like food or money."
