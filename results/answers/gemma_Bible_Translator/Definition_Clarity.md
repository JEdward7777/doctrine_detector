## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**In the Christian context, adultery is defined as any sexual act outside of a marriage between a man and a woman who are legally and biblically married to each other.**

**Scripture clearly condemns adultery as a serious sin that violates God's laws and undermines the covenant relationship between God and his people.**

**Relevant biblical passages:**

* **Matthew 5:27-28:** "You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
* **1 Corinthians 6:18:** "Flee from sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, sexual or otherwise."
* **Hebrews 13:4:** "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral."

**Therefore, adultery encompasses:**

* Any sexual act outside of marriage
* Any consensual sexual act between a married person and someone who is not their spouse
* Any sexual act between two people who are not legally or biblically married to each other

**Note:** The Christian understanding of adultery is based on biblical teachings and may vary slightly across different denominations or cultures.
