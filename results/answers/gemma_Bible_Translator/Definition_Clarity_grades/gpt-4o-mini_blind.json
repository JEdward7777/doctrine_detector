It is supported by relevant biblical passages and clearly articulates the seriousness of adultery as a sin. The inclusion of various scenarios that fall under the umbrella of adultery demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. The mention of potential variations in interpretations across denominations is also a thoughtful addition. Great job!"
