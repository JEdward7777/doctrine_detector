  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of the Christian definition of adultery according to Scripture, citing relevant biblical passages to support their points. The answer effectively highlights the seriousness of adultery as a sin that goes against God's laws and undermines the sanctity of marriage. The only minor critique is the inclusion of additional details beyond the reference answer, which, while enhancing the depth of explanation, slightly deviates from the concise definition provided by the teacher."
