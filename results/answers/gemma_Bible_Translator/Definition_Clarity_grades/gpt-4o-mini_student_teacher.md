Understanding the Biblical definition and implications of adultery.

## [Answer](../Definition_Clarity.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**In the Christian context, adultery is defined as any sexual act outside of a marriage between a man and a woman who are legally and biblically married to each other.**

**Scripture clearly condemns adultery as a serious sin that violates God's laws and undermines the covenant relationship between God and his people.**

**Relevant biblical passages:**

* **Matthew 5:27-28:** "You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
* **1 Corinthians 6:18:** "Flee from sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, sexual or otherwise."
* **Hebrews 13:4:** "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral."

**Therefore, adultery encompasses:**

* Any sexual act outside of marriage
* Any consensual sexual act between a married person and someone who is not their spouse
* Any sexual act between two people who are not legally or biblically married to each other

**Note:** The Christian understanding of adultery is based on biblical teachings and may vary slightly across different denominations or cultures.

Grade: 90

Comment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of the Christian definition of adultery according to Scripture, citing relevant biblical passages to support their points. The answer effectively highlights the seriousness of adultery as a sin that goes against God's laws and undermines the sanctity of marriage. The only minor critique is the inclusion of additional details beyond the reference answer, which, while enhancing the depth of explanation, slightly deviates from the concise definition provided by the teacher.
