  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the Christian understanding of adultery, supported by relevant biblical passages. It effectively addresses the concern by clearly outlining the Biblical definition and implications of adultery within a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction in points is for not explicitly mentioning adultery as any sexual act outside of marriage in the initial definition itself, which is included in the full explanation provided. Overall, a very strong response from a Christian perspective."
