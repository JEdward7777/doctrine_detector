The primary role of angels as communicators of God's will, intercessors for humanity, protectors of believers, and preparers of divine interventions is clearly articulated. The explanation aligns well with Christian beliefs about angels, emphasizing their role in God's plan and their significance in fostering faith and understanding of divine protection. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern by illustrating how the understanding of angels can deepen faith and provide assurance of God's guidance and care."
