Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of understanding angels' roles in deepening faith and assuring believers of God's protection and guidance. The only slight room for improvement would be to further connect the detailed biblical definition with how understanding angels' roles can specifically deepen faith and provide assurance, perhaps by including more direct scriptural references on faith and protection."
