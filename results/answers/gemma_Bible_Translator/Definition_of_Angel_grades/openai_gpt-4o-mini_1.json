It not only expands on the primary characteristics of angels but also delves into their roles in delivering God's messages, interceding for humanity, offering protection, and preparing for divine interventions. The response effectively addresses the concern by showcasing how understanding the role of angels can deepen faith and provide assurance of God's presence, protection, and guidance in believers' lives. The only room for improvement would be to incorporate more specific biblical references to reinforce the points made. Overall, an excellent response."
