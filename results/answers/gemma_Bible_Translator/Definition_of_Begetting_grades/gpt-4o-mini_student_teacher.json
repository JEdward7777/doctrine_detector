  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer regarding the term 'beget' in a Biblical context, focusing on both genetic and spiritual aspects. However, the answer did not align with the teacher's reference answer, which stated that 'beget' signifies becoming the father of someone and establishing a paternal relationship. While the student's answer included relevant biblical references and theological implications, it missed the central point of paternal relationship highlighted in the teacher's reference answer."
