  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns closely with the reference answer. They have accurately highlighted key biblical principles and passages related to being a believer in Christ. The only minor deduction is for the additional details provided beyond the reference answer, which while helpful, were not explicitly required in the question. Overall, a strong and thorough response demonstrating a solid understanding of the concept of being a believer in Christ according to the Bible."
