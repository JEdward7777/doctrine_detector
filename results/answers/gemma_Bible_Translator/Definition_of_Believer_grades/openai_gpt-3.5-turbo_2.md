**According to the Bible, a believer is anyone who:**

* **Accepts Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior:** "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8). 
* **Believes in Jesus Christ:** "Whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16). 
* **Commits their life to following Jesus Christ:** "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

**Biblical passages that support this definition:**

* "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).
* "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believed on his name" (John 1:12).
* "He who has faith in him has eternal life" (John 20:31).
* "For by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8).

**Therefore, anyone who:**

* Confesses Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior
* Believes in his sacrifice for sin
* Lives in accordance with his teachings

**is classified as a believer according to the Bible.**
