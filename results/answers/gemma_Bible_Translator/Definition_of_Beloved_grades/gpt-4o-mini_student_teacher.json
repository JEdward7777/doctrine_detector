  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed explanation of the term \"beloved\" in a biblical context, with references to relevant verses and theological significance. The answer effectively addresses the concern of understanding the depth of God's love for Jesus and believers. However, they could strengthen their answer by directly referencing the relationship between God and Jesus as the teacher's reference does."
