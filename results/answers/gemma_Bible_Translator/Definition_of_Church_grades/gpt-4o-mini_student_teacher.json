  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive understanding of the term 'church' in the New Testament by considering its various dimensions such as the local assembly, the visible body of Christ, the spiritual institution, and the kingdom of God. The response reflects a deep understanding of the multifaceted nature of the Church. However, the answer could have further emphasized the central role of believers in Jesus as the core definition of the Church, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
