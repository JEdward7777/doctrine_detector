It correctly emphasizes the importance of the church as a spiritual institution, the visible body of Christ globally, and the Kingdom of God being advanced through the Church. The concern regarding the church's role as more than just a building is effectively addressed by explaining the broader spiritual, mystical, and cosmic significance of the church in Christian theology. Great job in providing a solid biblical perspective on the concept of the church."
