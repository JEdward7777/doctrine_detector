## [Answer](../Definition_of_Confession.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**To confess according to the Bible means:**

**1. Public declaration of sin and reliance on Christ's redemption:**

* "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9)
* "Confession of sin is a vital part of the Christian life. It demonstrates humility before God, reveals our dependence on his grace, and fosters a close relationship with him." (Theopedia)

**2. Affirmation of biblical truth:**

* "Confession must be based on the authority of Scripture. Christians must confess that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, died for our sins, and rose from the dead." (GotQuestions.org)
* "All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness." (2 Timothy 3:16)

**3. Openness to correction and growth:**

* "Confession is not simply a verbal declaration but also a willingness to listen and learn from God's Word and the teaching of others." (Crossway)
* "Humility and openness to correction are essential aspects of genuine confession." (Theopedia)

**4. Genuine repentance and turning away from sin:**

* "Confession must be accompanied by genuine repentance and a turning away from sin. True confession results in changed behavior." (GotQuestions.org)
* "Confession is not simply a mental assent but a heartfelt turning away from sin." (Crossway)

**Biblical examples of confession:**

* Peter's confession of Jesus as the Son of God (Matthew 16:16-17)
* Paul's confession of his sins and reliance on God's grace (Romans 7:18-25)
* The church's confession of their errors and need for forgiveness (Acts 2:38)

90.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 90.

The student provided a comprehensive answer that covers various aspects of confession according to the Bible, including the public declaration of sin and reliance on Christ's redemption, affirmation of biblical truth, openness to correction and growth, genuine repentance, and biblical examples of confession. The answer is well-supported with relevant Bible verses and references from authoritative Christian sources.

The only area for improvement would be to incorporate and directly address the definition given by the teacher, which emphasizes confessing means admitting or asserting that something is true, whether that be about God or one's own sins. By directly connecting the student's detailed points with this core definition, the answer could have been strengthened further.
