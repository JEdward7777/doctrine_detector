  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"evangelist,\" touching on its literal meaning, biblical usage, and figurative meaning in Christian theology. The student demonstrated a clear understanding of the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel. The only minor discrepancy was not directly quoting the reference answer for the literal meaning, but the student's explanation aligns with the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern."
