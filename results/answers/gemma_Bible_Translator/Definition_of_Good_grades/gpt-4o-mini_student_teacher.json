  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive response that effectively contrasts the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil' in relation to daily decision-making. The student's detailed breakdown of the characteristics, sources, natures, and consequences of 'good' and 'evil' aligns well with a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student has drawn clear distinctions between the two concepts and highlighted the importance of aligning with God's will for making moral decisions. The organization of the answer and the use of relevant biblical references are commendable. However, to achieve a perfect score, the student could have directly referenced the teacher's answer for additional support or comparison, and may have elaborated further on the practical implications of understanding 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making scenarios. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
