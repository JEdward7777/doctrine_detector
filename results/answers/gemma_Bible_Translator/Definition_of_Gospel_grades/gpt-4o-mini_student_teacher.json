  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the literal meaning and biblical understanding of the term 'gospel' in Christian faith. They accurately conveyed the core message of salvation through Jesus Christ as the central theme of the gospel and highlighted its significance in offering forgiveness, new life, and eternal life. However, the student's response is slightly more extensive than the reference answer, which is why a minor deduction is made in the grading. Overall, they demonstrated a solid understanding of the definition and significance of the Gospel in Christian faith."
