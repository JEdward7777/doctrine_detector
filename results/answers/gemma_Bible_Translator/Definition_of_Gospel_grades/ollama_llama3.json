The student correctly identifies that the term means \"good news\" and references Jesus' sacrifice on the cross as the central message of salvation.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more depth and breadth in discussing the biblical understanding of the gospel. For instance, the answer only mentions a few key events in Jesus' life (birth, life, death, resurrection) without elaborating on their importance or how they relate to the broader message of salvation.\n\nAdditionally, while the student touches on the significance of the gospel as \"good news\" for people, it would be helpful to explore this concept further and discuss its implications for Christian living and mission. Nevertheless, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the definition and significance of the Gospel in Christian faith."
