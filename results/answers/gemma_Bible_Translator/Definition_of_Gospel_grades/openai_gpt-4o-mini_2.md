## [Answer](../Definition_of_Gospel.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
## Literal Meaning of 'Gospel':

The Greek word 'gospel' (evangelion) literally means **"good news"** or **"glad tidings."** It emphasizes the positive message of salvation and redemption offered through Jesus Christ.

## Biblical Understanding:

Within the Bible, the 'gospel' refers to the central message of Christianity: **the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ.** This message includes:

* **His birth** as the Son of God
* **His life** as the perfect sacrifice for sin
* **His death** on the cross as the payment for sin
* **His resurrection** from the dead as the victory over sin and death
* **His ascension** to heaven as the triumphant King

The 'gospel' is not merely historical information. It is a powerful message of hope and transformation that offers:

* **Forgiveness of sins:** Jesus' sacrifice covers the penalty for our sins.
* **New life:** Through faith in Jesus, we receive the power to overcome sin and live for God.
* **Eternal life:** Jesus' resurrection guarantees our own resurrection and entrance into heaven.

The 'gospel' is central to Christian faith and practice. It is the foundation of Christian theology and the driving force behind Christian mission and outreach.
