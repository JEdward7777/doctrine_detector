  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer, highlighting the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in relation to God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and believers. However, the answer went beyond the specific concern of understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture. The teacher's reference answer focused primarily on God as the 'Holy One,' which is the key aspect to consider in this context. The student's response, while informative, could have been more focused on this central theme."
