They provide clear and concise explanations of its application to God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and believers. The inclusion of relevant biblical references reinforces the credibility of the response. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific significance of the \"Holy One of Israel\" in the Old Testament and how it relates to the broader concept of God's holiness. Additionally, the student could have elaborated on the implications of God's holiness for human morality and ethics."
