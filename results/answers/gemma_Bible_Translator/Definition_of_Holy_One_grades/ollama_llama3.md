I'd give this response a score of 85.

The main strength of this response is its clear acknowledgment of the term "Holy One" referring to God, particularly in the context of Old Testament Israel and Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The writer's focus on God's holiness and His unique role in scripture aligns well with the concern about understanding God's holiness.

However, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, the response could delve deeper into the significance of the term "Holy One" beyond just its reference to God. For instance, it could explore how this term reveals God's character, His relationship with humanity, and His role in redemption. Secondly, while the writer mentions Jesus' holiness, they don't explicitly state how Jesus' holiness is rooted in His life, death, and resurrection.

Overall, I believe the response demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical context and significance of the term "Holy One," but could benefit from further development and nuance.
