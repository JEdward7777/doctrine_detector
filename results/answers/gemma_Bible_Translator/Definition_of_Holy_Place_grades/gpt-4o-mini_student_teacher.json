  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the significance of the 'holy place' in the context of the tabernacle or temple, covering various aspects such as separation from the profane, representation of God's holiness, atonement and prayer, deity's throne room, representation of the spiritual realm, access to God, and encounter with God. The Biblical references provided are also a strong point. However, the student's answer lacks focus on the specific details mentioned in the reference answer, particularly the presence of the altar of incense and the table with the bread of the presence, which are key elements of the 'holy place' in the tabernacle or temple. The student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing these elements to align more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
