The biblical examples and key verses further strengthen the explanation. The response aligns well with the concern of understanding the biblical definition of repentance for fostering genuine spiritual growth. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate a deeper theological reflection on the significance of Christ's sacrifice in the process of repentance."
