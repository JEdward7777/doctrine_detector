It correctly highlights that saints are believers in Christ who are sanctified by the Holy Spirit, those who have been made holy through Christ's work, and form a community of faithful individuals. The Biblical references and clarification on the term not being used for physically deceased believers are excellent additions that strengthen the response. Great job overall!"
