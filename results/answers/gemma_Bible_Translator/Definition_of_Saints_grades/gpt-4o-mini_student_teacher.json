They accurately highlighted the biblical understanding of saints as believers in Christ who have been sanctified through His sacrifice. The inclusion of relevant biblical references and the clarification that 'saints' refer to living believers being transformed by the Holy Spirit were commendable. However, the answer could be improved by directly stating that the term 'saints' literally means 'holy ones' in line with the given reference answer."
