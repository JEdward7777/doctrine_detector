It correctly emphasizes that saints are believers in Jesus who are sanctified by the Holy Spirit and set apart for God. The inclusion of biblical references and clarification on the term's usage further strengthens the response. This demonstrates a sound understanding of the biblical definition of saints and effectively distinguishes between cultural and scriptural interpretations. Great job!"
