## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**In the context of the New Testament, the term 'saints' (Greek: 'hagios') refers to:**

**1. Believers in Christ:**

* The New Testament teaches that all who believe in Jesus Christ are sanctified by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:29-30).
* This means they are set apart for God and declared righteous through Christ's sacrifice.

**2. Those who have been made holy:**

* The term 'saints' also refers to those who have been purified and made holy in their lives.
* This holiness is not due to their own merit or works, but because of Christ's work on the cross.

**3. A community of believers:**

* The New Testament describes the believers as a "holy nation" (1 Peter 2:9) and a "people of God" (1 Timothy 6:16).
* This community is united in their faith in Christ and in their commitment to living holy lives.

**Biblical References:**

* "Blessed are the saints: for they are God's people" (Matthew 5:12)
* "Therefore, holy brethren, share the sufferings of Christ, so that you may also be glorified with him" (1 Peter 4:13)
* "To the saints and faithful servants of Jesus Christ" (Revelation 1:6)

**It is important to note:**

* The term 'saints' is not used in the New Testament to refer to those who are physically dead.
* It refers to believers who are alive and are being transformed by the Holy Spirit into the image of Christ.
