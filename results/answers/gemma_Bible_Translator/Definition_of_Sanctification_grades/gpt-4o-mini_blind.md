**Sanctification** is a multifaceted process that involves both God's action and our response.

**Divine Sanctification:**

* God's work of grace in the hearts of believers.
* Begins at salvation and continues throughout our lives.
* God progressively transforms us into the image of Christ.
* This transformation involves:
    * Renewing our minds (Rom. 12:2)
    * Transforming our wills (2 Cor. 10:5)
    * Conforming our actions to God's will (Gal. 5:18)

**Human Sanctification:**

* Our response to God's sanctifying grace.
* Involves:
    * Willingly cooperating with God's work in our lives.
    * Obedience to God's commands.
    * Growing in love for God and others.
    * Bearing fruit that demonstrates our salvation (Gal. 5:22-23).

**Biblical References:**

* **1 Thessalonians 5:23:** "May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
* **Hebrews 13:12:** "Therefore, let us pursue holiness, and the God who is faithful will provide what you need."
* **2 Corinthians 3:18:** "But we are all being changed into something new; we are being transformed into the image of Christ."

**Key Concepts:**

* **Sanctification is progressive:** We are gradually transformed into the image of Christ.
