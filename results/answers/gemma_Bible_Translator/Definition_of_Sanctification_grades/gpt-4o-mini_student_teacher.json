They correctly highlight the roles of God's grace and our response in sanctification, supported by relevant biblical references. The inclusion of key concepts further enhances the clarity of their explanation. However, the response could have been improved by directly referencing the basic definition of sanctification as \"to set apart or to make holy,\" as stated in the reference answer. This would have further solidified the foundational understanding before delving into the multifaceted process."
