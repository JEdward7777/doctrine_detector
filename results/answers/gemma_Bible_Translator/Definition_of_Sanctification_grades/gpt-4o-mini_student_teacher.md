**Sanctification** is a multifaceted process that involves both God's action and our response.

**Divine Sanctification:**

* God's work of grace in the hearts of believers.
* Begins at salvation and continues throughout our lives.
* God progressively transforms us into the image of Christ.
* This transformation involves:
    * Renewing our minds (Rom. 12:2)
    * Transforming our wills (2 Cor. 10:5)
    * Conforming our actions to God's will (Gal. 5:18)

**Human Sanctification:**

* Our response to God's sanctifying grace.
* Involves:
    * Willingly cooperating with God's work in our lives.
    * Obedience to God's commands.
    * Growing in love for God and others.
    * Bearing fruit that demonstrates our salvation (Gal. 5:22-23).

**Biblical References:**

* **1 Thessalonians 5:23:** "May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
* **Hebrews 13:12:** "Therefore, let us pursue holiness, and the God who is faithful will provide what you need."
* **2 Corinthians 3:18:** "But we are all being changed into something new; we are being transformed into the image of Christ."

**Key Concepts:**

* **Sanctification is a journey:** It is an ongoing process that continues throughout our lives.
* **Sanctification is relational:** It involves both God's action and our response.
* **Sanctification is progressive:** We are gradually transformed into the image of Christ.
* **Sanctification is for God's glory:** Our transformation reflects God's character and brings him glory.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student's response provides a comprehensive understanding of sanctification according to the Bible by incorporating both divine and human aspects of the process. They correctly highlight the roles of God's grace and our response in sanctification, supported by relevant biblical references. The inclusion of key concepts further enhances the clarity of their explanation. However, the response could have been improved by directly referencing the basic definition of sanctification as "to set apart or to make holy," as stated in the reference answer. This would have further solidified the foundational understanding before delving into the multifaceted process.
