  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately defines sanctification as \"the process of being made holy\" which aligns with the biblical concept of setting apart or making something/human holy. The addition of biblical references and key concepts further supports the understanding of sanctification.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have more explicitly connected the concept of sanctification to the Christian worldview and its implications for daily life. For example, it would be beneficial to explore how sanctification is not just a one-time event but an ongoing process that requires human cooperation and obedience to God's commands.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical definition of sanctification and provides additional context through biblical references and key concepts."
