## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Sanctification** is a multifaceted process that involves both God's action and our response.

**Divine Sanctification:**

* God's work of grace in the hearts of believers.
* Begins at salvation and continues throughout our lives.
* God progressively transforms us into the image of Christ.
* This transformation involves:
    * Renewing our minds (Rom. 12:2)
    * Transforming our wills (2 Cor. 10:5)
    * Conforming our actions to God's will (Gal. 5:18)

**Human Sanctification:**

* Our response to God's sanctifying grace.
* Involves:
    * Willingly cooperating with God's work in our lives.
    * Obedience to God's commands.
    * Growing in love for God and others.
    * Bearing fruit that demonstrates our salvation (Gal. 5:22-23).

**Biblical References:**

* **1 Thessalonians 5:23:** "May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
* **Hebrews 13:12:** "Therefore, let us pursue holiness, and the God who is faithful will provide what you need."
* **2 Corinthians 3:18:** "But we are all being changed into something new; we are being transformed into the image of Christ."

**Key Concepts:**

* **Sanctification is a journey:** It is an ongoing process that continues throughout our lives.
* **Sanctification is relational:** It involves both God's action and our response.
* **Sanctification is progressive:** We are gradually transformed into the image of Christ.
* **Sanctification is for God's glory:** Our transformation reflects God's character and brings him glory.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response accurately defines sanctification as "the process of being made holy" which aligns with the biblical concept of setting apart or making something/human holy. The addition of biblical references and key concepts further supports the understanding of sanctification.

However, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have more explicitly connected the concept of sanctification to the Christian worldview and its implications for daily life. For example, it would be beneficial to explore how sanctification is not just a one-time event but an ongoing process that requires human cooperation and obedience to God's commands.

Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical definition of sanctification and provides additional context through biblical references and key concepts.
