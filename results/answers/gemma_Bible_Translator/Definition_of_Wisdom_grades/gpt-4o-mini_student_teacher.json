  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 95. \n\nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical definition of wisdom by providing detailed explanations supported by relevant Bible verses. The student addresses both the spiritual and practical aspects of wisdom, highlights key characteristics, provides implications for Christians, and offers examples of biblical wisdom. The answer is well-structured and reflects a deep insight into the topic.\n\nThe only minor improvement would be to include a direct reference to the concern mentioned, which emphasizes the importance of understanding biblical wisdom for aligning decisions with God's will. Overall, the student's answer is thorough and aligns well with a Christian worldview on wisdom."
