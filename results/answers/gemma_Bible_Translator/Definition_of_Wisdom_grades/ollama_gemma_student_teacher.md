**Biblical Definition of Wisdom:**

Biblical wisdom encompasses two primary aspects:

**1. Understanding and Applying God's Word:**

* Wisdom begins with fearing and loving the Lord (Proverbs 1:7).
* Understanding God's character, principles, and commands is foundational (Psalm 119:105).
* Applying God's Word in practical situations demonstrates wisdom (James 1:22-25).

**2. Practical Understanding and Application:**

* Wisdom involves discerning right and wrong, discerning what is best in specific situations (Proverbs 3:13-18).
* It includes practical skills and knowledge for daily life (1 Corinthians 2:6).
* Wisdom manifests in thoughtful deliberation, sound decisions, and responsible actions (Ecclesiastes 9:18).

**Key Characteristics of Biblical Wisdom:**

* **Fear of the Lord:** A deep reverence and love for God is the starting point of wisdom.
* **Humility:** Wisdom recognizes that true knowledge comes from God and acknowledges the limits of human understanding.
* **Integrity:** Wisdom avoids deception and embraces honesty and righteousness.
* **Compassion:** Wisdom understands the needs of others and seeks to help them.
* **Practicality:** Wisdom applies knowledge and skills to real-life situations.

**Implications for Christians:**

* To be wise Christians, we must immerse ourselves in God's Word and apply its principles to our lives.
* We must humbly seek guidance from others who possess wisdom and experience.
* We must practice discerning between right and wrong and making informed decisions.
* We must demonstrate compassion and care for others.

**Examples of Biblical Wisdom:**

* The proverbs of Solomon (Proverbs)

Biblical wisdom is not merely intellectual knowledge but a practical application of God's Word and love in everyday life. By cultivating wisdom, Christians can live lives that honor God, make wise decisions, and demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit.
