However, the reference answer from the teacher simplifies the definition by focusing on the core belief of trusting Jesus as the Son of God for salvation. While the student's answer provides valuable insights, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing the foundational importance of faith in Jesus for salvation, aligning it more closely with the reference answer."
