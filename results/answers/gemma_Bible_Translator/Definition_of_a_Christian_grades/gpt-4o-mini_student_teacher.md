**Biblical Definition of a Christian:**

The New Testament offers several definitions of a "Christian," each emphasizing different aspects of the faith.

**1. Follower of Jesus Christ:**

* "Christian" is primarily used in the New Testament to describe those who follow the teachings and example of Jesus Christ (Acts 11:26, 26:26).
* This definition highlights the central belief of Christianity: salvation through faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God.

**2. Believer in Christ:**

* Paul uses "Christian" to describe those who believe in Christ as the Son of God (1 Corinthians 4:9).
* This definition emphasizes the importance of faith in receiving salvation.

**3. One United in Christ:**

* The Apostle John describes Christians as "those who have been baptized into Christ" (1 John 5:13).
* This definition highlights the communal aspect of Christianity, where believers are united in their faith in Christ.

**4. Witnesses of Christ:**

* Early Christians were called "Christians" because they were witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus Christ (Acts 1:32).
* This definition emphasizes the role of Christians as proclaimers of the gospel.

**5. Those Obedient to Christ:**

* In 1 Peter 1:1, Peter refers to Christians as "elect according to the foreknowledge of God, and beloved in Christ."
* This definition emphasizes the importance of obedience to Christ's teachings as part of the Christian life.

**Therefore, a biblical Christian is:**

* A follower of Jesus Christ
* A believer in Christ's deity
* A member of the Christian community
* A witness to Christ's resurrection
* Obedient to Christ's teachings

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer outlining various aspects of the biblical definition of a Christian, covering important dimensions such as following Jesus, belief in Christ's deity, unity in Christ, witnessing to the resurrection, and obedience to Christ's teachings. However, the reference answer from the teacher simplifies the definition by focusing on the core belief of trusting Jesus as the Son of God for salvation. While the student's answer provides valuable insights, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing the foundational importance of faith in Jesus for salvation, aligning it more closely with the reference answer.
