The New Testament offers several definitions of a "Christian," each emphasizing different aspects of the faith.

**1. Follower of Jesus Christ:**

* "Christian" is primarily used in the New Testament to describe those who follow the teachings and example of Jesus Christ (Acts 11:26, 26:26).
* This definition highlights the central belief of Christianity: salvation through faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God.

**2. Believer in Christ:**

* Paul uses "Christian" to describe those who believe in Christ as the Son of God (1 Corinthians 4:9).
* This definition emphasizes the importance of faith in receiving salvation.

**3. One United in Christ:**

* The Apostle John describes Christians as "those who have been baptized into Christ" (1 John 5:13).
* This definition highlights the communal aspect of Christianity, where believers are united in their faith in Christ.

**4. Witnesses of Christ:**

* Early Christians were called "Christians" because they were witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus Christ (Acts 1:32).
* This definition emphasizes the role of Christians as proclaimers of the gospel.

**5. Those Obedient to Christ:**

* In 1 Peter 1:1, Peter refers to Christians as "elect according to the foreknowledge of God, and beloved in Christ."
