The student has incorporated key elements such as the demonstration of God's power, validation of faith, meeting human needs, and displaying God's love in relation to miracles. The student also accurately highlights the implications of miracles for Christian faith. The only area for improvement is to simplify the language and structure of the response for better clarity and effectiveness in conveying the message."
