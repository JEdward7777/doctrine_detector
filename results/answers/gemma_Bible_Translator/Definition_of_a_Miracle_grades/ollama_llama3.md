* **Divine power:** The miracles showcase God's unlimited power and ability to intervene in human affairs.

The biblical miracles have profound implications for Christian faith:

* **Faith in God's power:** They demonstrate that God is not limited by human understanding or natural laws.
* **Confidence in God's promises:** The miracles confirm God's faithfulness and trustworthiness in fulfilling his promises.
* **Hope for the future:** The resurrection of Jesus Christ, the ultimate miracle, offers believers hope and assurance of eternal life.
