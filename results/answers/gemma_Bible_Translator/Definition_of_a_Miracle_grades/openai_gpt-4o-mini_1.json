It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding miracles can deepen faith and acknowledgment of God's power. The detailed discussion on biblical perspectives, relationship to God's authority, implications for Christian faith, and the conclusion all align well with the given answer and concern. The only minor improvement could be further elaboration on the impact of miracles on individual believers' lives."
