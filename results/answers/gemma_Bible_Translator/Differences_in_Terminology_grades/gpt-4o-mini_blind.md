Grade: 90

Comment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the key differences between the terms 'exhort,' 'encourage,' and 'admonish,' considering aspects like motivation, tone, focus, and context. The inclusion of examples from Christian scripture enhances the explanation and demonstrates understanding of how these terms are used in a theological context. The response could be further improved by connecting the definitions more explicitly to Christian doctrine and emphasizing the spiritual significance of each term within a Christian worldview.
