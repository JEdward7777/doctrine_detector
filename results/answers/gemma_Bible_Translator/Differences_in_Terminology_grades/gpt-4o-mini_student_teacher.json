  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the key differences between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" from a Christian perspective. The student's response not only defines the terms but also highlights the nuances in motivation, tone, focus, and context, supported by relevant biblical examples. The only minor concern is that while the student has elaborated on the appropriateness of each term, they could have connected it more explicitly to scriptural references and the teachings of Jesus Christ, which would have further strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
