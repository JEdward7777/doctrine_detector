## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the response does provide some general definitions for each term, it lacks depth and clarity in its explanation of the key differences between "exhort," "encourage," and "admonish." The definitions provided are also not entirely accurate, as "exhort" is not simply about encouraging someone to do what is right, but rather has a more formal and authoritative connotation.

The concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture is only partially addressed in this response. The examples provided from Scripture are helpful, but they could be further explained and contextualized to illustrate how each term is used in different situations.

Overall, while this response provides some useful information, it does not thoroughly address the concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture.
