It effectively addresses the concern by referencing specific biblical examples and highlighting the nuanced distinctions in motivation, tone, focus, and context for each term. The added scripture references further support the explanation, demonstrating a solid understanding of how these concepts are used in the context of Scripture. Great job overall!"
