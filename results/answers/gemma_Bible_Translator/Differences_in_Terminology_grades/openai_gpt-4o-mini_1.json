  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the provided definitions of \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" by delving into the nuances of their motivations, tones, focuses, and contexts, all while anchoring them within relevant biblical examples. It successfully addresses the concern by elucidating the distinct applications of each form of encouragement according to scripture. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to strengthen the connection between the provided definitions and their scriptural basis even further for greater depth and clarity."
