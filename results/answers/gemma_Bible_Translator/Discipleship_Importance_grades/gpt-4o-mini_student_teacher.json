  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer, touching on various aspects of the significance of the twelve apostles in Christian faith. They covered the apostles' role as eyewitnesses, possession of spiritual gifts, faithfulness to Jesus, diverse backgrounds, and willingness to sacrifice. The references to Biblical passages enhanced the response, grounding it in Scripture. The only area of improvement could be directly linking the chosen apostles' unique call to spread Jesus' teachings with the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament as mentioned in the reference answer."
