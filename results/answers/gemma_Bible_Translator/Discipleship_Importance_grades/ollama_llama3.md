85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a clear and concise explanation of why Jesus chose the twelve apostles, highlighting their unique qualities as eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection, as well as their diverse backgrounds and personalities. The inclusion of specific biblical references adds credibility and depth to the discussion.

However, I would deduct points because the response does not fully capture the significance of the apostles in establishing the foundation of the early Church. While it mentions that they were chosen for their unique call to spread Jesus' teachings, it could delve deeper into how this call led to the establishment of the Church and the apostles' role in shaping its theology and practices.

The response also does not explicitly address the concern about understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. While it touches on their roles as eyewitnesses and spreaders of Jesus' teachings, it could provide more explicit connections to the biblical text and the early Christian community.

Overall, while the response provides a good foundation for understanding the significance of the apostles, it could be strengthened by further exploration of their role in establishing the Church and their theological contributions.
