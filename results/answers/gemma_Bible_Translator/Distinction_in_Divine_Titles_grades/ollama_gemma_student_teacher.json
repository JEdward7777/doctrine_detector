They correctly identify the unique identity of Yahweh and the general nature of LORD, highlighting how such a translation would blur the distinction between the two. Additionally, the student emphasizes the importance of clarity and precision in biblical theology, arguing that the translation would undermine understanding of God's character and significance."
