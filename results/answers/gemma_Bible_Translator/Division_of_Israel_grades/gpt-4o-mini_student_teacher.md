Grade: 50

Comment: The student correctly identified a major event in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign, which is the Babylonian Captivity. However, the student's answer did not address the specific concern regarding the division of the Israelites into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. This overlooks the significance of this division both historically and spiritually in Israel's history.
