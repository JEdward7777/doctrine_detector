**Comment:**

The student's answer correctly identifies the Babylonian Captivity as the major event that occurred in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign. It also briefly explains the cause of the exile, linking it to Israel's sins and disobedience to God. 

However, the answer lacks additional elaboration on the spiritual significance of the division of the Israelites, which was the specified concern in the prompt. The student's answer would be stronger if it addressed this aspect of the question.
