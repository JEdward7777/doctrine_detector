Grade: 70

Comment: The response addresses the concern by briefly mentioning the division of Israel following King Solomon's reign. However, it could have provided more detail on the historical and spiritual significance of this division, such as the consequences of the division on Israel's relationship with God and how it set the stage for future events like the Babylonian Captivity. More depth and analysis would have greatly improved the response.
