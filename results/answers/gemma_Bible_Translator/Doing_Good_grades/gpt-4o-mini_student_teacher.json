  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported response that aligns closely with the Christian worldview. They emphasized obedience to God's commandments, transformation of lives, witnessing Christ's love, building God's Kingdom, and personal growth, all of which are key aspects of living out one's faith through good deeds. The Biblical examples cited further strengthen their argument. While the student's answer went beyond the reference answer in depth and detail, their understanding and application of Christian principles in relation to doing good to others are commendable."
