  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that aligns closely with the reference answer. They have effectively highlighted key biblical passages, emphasized responsible stewardship, the partnership with God, and the ethical considerations of exercising dominion over the earth. The discussion on the limits of dominion and the importance of ethical responsibility demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on humanity's role in caring for the earth. Great job overall!"
