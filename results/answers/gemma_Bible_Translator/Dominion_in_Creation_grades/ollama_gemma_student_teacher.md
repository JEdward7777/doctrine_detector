## Humanity's Role in Dominion over the Earth:

The Bible teaches a multifaceted view of humanity's role in having dominion over the earth. 

**1) Mandate of Dominion:**

* Genesis 1:26-28 describes God granting humanity dominion over the earth and its resources. 
* This dominion is not seen as an absolute control, but as responsible stewardship and care for the creation.

**2) Responsible Stewardship:**

* The Bible emphasizes responsible use of resources and care for the environment. 
* Concepts like the Sabbath (Genesis 2:1-3) and principles of ecological responsibility emerge from this stewardship perspective.

**3) Partnership with God:**

* Human dominion is not independent of God's sovereignty. 
* The Bible teaches that God is ultimately in control of the earth and its resources. 
* We are partners with God in caring for and maintaining the health of the planet.

**4) Limits on Dominion:**

* The Bible also recognizes limits on human dominion. 
* Concepts like the "dominion of violence" (Genesis 9:22-23) are seen as fallen and destructive. 
* Human activities must not prioritize control over justice, peace, and ecological balance.

**5) Ethical Responsibility:**

* Our dominion should be guided by ethical principles like justice, love, and mercy. 
* We are responsible for using resources in ways that benefit the whole creation, not just ourselves.


**Key Bible Verses:**

* Genesis 1:26-28
* Genesis 2:1-3
* Romans 8:19-21
* Colossians 1:16

**Conclusion:**

The Bible teaches a balanced view of humanity's role in having dominion over the earth. We are responsible stewards, partners with God, and must exercise our influence ethically and responsibly for the benefit of the entire creation.
