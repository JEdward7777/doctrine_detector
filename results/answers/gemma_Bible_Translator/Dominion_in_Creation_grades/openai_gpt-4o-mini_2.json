The inclusion of key Bible verses and clear points on responsible stewardship, partnership with God, limits on dominion, and ethical responsibility demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic. The response could be further enhanced by connecting each point directly to the concern raised to strengthen the coherence of the argument."
