  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of different perspectives and relevant biblical passages concerning the duration of 'the last days'. It effectively acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the exact timeframe while emphasizing the importance of spiritual preparedness and faithfulness. The doctrinal accuracy and depth of analysis are commendable, although there could be a bit more emphasis on the imminence of Christ's return and the call to readiness. Great job overall."
