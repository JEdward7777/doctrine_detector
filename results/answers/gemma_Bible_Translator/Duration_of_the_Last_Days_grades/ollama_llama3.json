  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern about uncertainty affecting how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. The author acknowledges that the exact duration of the \"last days\" is not explicitly stated in the Bible, but instead provides thoughtful biblical references and interpretations to shed light on the nature and significance of this period. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of faithfulness and readiness for Christ's return, which aligns with the concern.\n\nWhile the response could be strengthened by providing more explicit connections between the uncertainty of the \"last days\" and Christian living, it does a good job of presenting various perspectives and biblical insights to inform readers. Overall, this is a thoughtful and well-structured response that addresses the concern in a meaningful way."
