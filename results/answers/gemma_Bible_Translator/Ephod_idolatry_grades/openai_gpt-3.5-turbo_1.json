The application section offers practical steps for Christians to avoid idolatry and maintain spiritual purity. The conclusion effectively ties the lesson back to the importance of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively applies it to the given concern."
