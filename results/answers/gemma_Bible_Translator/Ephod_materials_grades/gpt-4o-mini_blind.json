However, they could have further elaborated by mentioning that the ephod was made of precious and intricately woven materials according to Exodus 28:6-8, such as gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen. Adding this detail would have demonstrated a deeper understanding of the topic from a theological perspective."
