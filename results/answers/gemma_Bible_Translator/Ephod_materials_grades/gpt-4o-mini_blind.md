Grade: 70

Comment: The student correctly acknowledges the lack of detailed information in the biblical text regarding the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod. However, they could have further elaborated by mentioning that the ephod was made of precious and intricately woven materials according to Exodus 28:6-8, such as gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen. Adding this detail would have demonstrated a deeper understanding of the topic from a theological perspective.
