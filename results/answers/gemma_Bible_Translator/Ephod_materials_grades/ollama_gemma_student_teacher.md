## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** The student correctly acknowledges the lack of explicit textual information regarding the materials used in the ephod's construction. However, they could have explored other relevant sources, such as ancient Egyptian textile traditions or scholarly interpretations of the biblical text, to provide a more comprehensive response from a theological perspective.
