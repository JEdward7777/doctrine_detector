The explanation is well-supported with scriptural references and demonstrates a strong understanding of the ephod's role as a symbol of covenant, intercession, God's presence, and divine glory. The connection to the high priest's mediation role and the reminder of God's faithfulness is well articulated. The response could be strengthened by including additional Old Testament references that specifically mention the ephod and its significance. Overall, a solid and well-rounded answer."
