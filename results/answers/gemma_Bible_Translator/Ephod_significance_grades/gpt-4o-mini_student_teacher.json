They highlighted various key aspects such as representation of the covenant, intercession and mediation, reminder of God's presence, manifestation of divine glory, and symbol of God's faithfulness. The student effectively tied these aspects back to the role of the high priest as a mediator and intercessor. However, the student missed mentioning the inclusion of the Urim and Thummim in the ephod, which was a crucial aspect mentioned in the reference answer."
