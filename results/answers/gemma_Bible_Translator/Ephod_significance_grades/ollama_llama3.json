The given answer only touches on the role of the high priest as mediator and the use of Urim and Thummim, whereas this response goes beyond that to discuss the representation of the covenant, intercession, reminder of God's presence, manifestation of divine glory, and symbol of God's faithfulness. While it doesn't fully address the concern of understanding Old Testament priesthood and worship practices, it does provide some insight into these areas.\n\nThe response is well-organized, using clear headings to divide the discussion into five key points. The language is also descriptive and engaging, helping to bring the significance of the ephod to life for the reader. However, it could be improved by more explicitly connecting the discussion of the ephod's significance to the concern of understanding Old Testament priesthood and worship practices."
