**God the Father:**

* Known for his love, mercy, and justice.

**God the Son (Jesus Christ):**

* Became incarnate to save humanity from sin and death.
* Offers forgiveness, redemption, and eternal life.

**God the Holy Spirit:**

* The third person of the Trinity.
* Comforter, guide, and advocate for believers.
* Responsible for regeneration, growth in faith, and empowering believers.

**Interdependence and Co-equality:**

* The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are eternally united in love and purpose.
* Each person possesses divine attributes and functions, but they are not independent of each other.
* Their essence is one, even though they have distinct personalities and roles.
