However, the answer lacks emphasis on the essential Christian theological concept that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are of one essence, which is crucial in clarifying the nature of the Trinity in Christian theology. A stronger emphasis on the oneness of essence among the three persons of the Trinity would have aligned the response more closely with the core Christian doctrine."
