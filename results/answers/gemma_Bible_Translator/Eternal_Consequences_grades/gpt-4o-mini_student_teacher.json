  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer from a biblical perspective regarding the eternal consequences for those described as \"perishing.\" The response effectively conveyed the seriousness of eternal separation from God and included relevant biblical references. The student also addressed important considerations such as free will, compassion, and contextual understanding. The only slight adjustment needed is to align the conclusion more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, an excellent understanding and application of Christian worldview principles."
