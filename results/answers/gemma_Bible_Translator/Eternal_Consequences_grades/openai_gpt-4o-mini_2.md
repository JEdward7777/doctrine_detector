# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Biblical Perspective:**

The Bible teaches that those who are "perishing" face eternal separation from God in judgment. This separation is due to their persistent rejection of God's love and salvation through Jesus Christ.

**Eternal Consequences:**

* **Separation from God:** Those who perish are separated from God's presence, fellowship, and blessing.
* **Judgment and Punishment:** God's justice demands punishment for sin, and those who persist in their sins will face eternal judgment.
* **Eternal Torment:** Some passages suggest that those who perish may experience physical and emotional torment in eternity.
* **Loss of Relationship with God:** The eternal separation from God means that they will lose their relationship with him, including their fellowship and inheritance.

**Biblical References:**

* "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the Son of God." - John 3:16
* "He who rejects the Son does not have the Father." - John 5:10
* "Whoever is not saved by the grace of God through faith in Christ Jesus is lost." - Ephesians 2:8-9

**Considerations:**

* **Free Will:** The Bible emphasizes that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works.
* **Compassion:** God is compassionate and desires none to perish. He offers salvation to all who will accept it.
* **Contextual Understanding:** The concept of "perishing" may have different nuances in different contexts.

**Conclusion:**

The eternal consequences for those who are described as "perishing" are severe and irreversible. It is crucial for individuals to accept God's love and salvation through Jesus Christ to avoid these consequences.
