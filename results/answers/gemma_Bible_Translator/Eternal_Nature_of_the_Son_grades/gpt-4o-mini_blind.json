  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and detailed explanation highlighting the distinctions between the Son of God and human sons in terms of existence and eternal nature. The answer is supported by relevant biblical references, which is commendable. However, to strengthen the response, further elaboration on the significance of the Son of God's eternal nature in relation to his role in salvation could have been included. Additionally, integrating a more in-depth theological reflection on the eternal generation of the Son and his unique relationship with the Father would have enhanced the depth of the answer."
