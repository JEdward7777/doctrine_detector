  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thorough response that effectively addresses the concern of emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God. The student clearly articulates the unique nature of the Son of God's existence and eternal life, referencing relevant biblical passages to support their claims. The addition of the reference to Jesus' role in creation further strengthens the response and aligns with the Christian worldview."
