## [Answer](../Eternal_Nature_of_the_Son.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The Son of God distinguishes himself from human sons in two fundamental ways:**

**1. Nature of Existence:**

* The Son of God exists in a unique relationship with the Father, being eternally begotten of the Father. This means he shares the Father's essence and nature. 
* Human sons are conceived by their earthly parents through biological processes. 
* The Son of God's existence transcends human understanding of generation and reproduction.


**2. Eternal Nature:**

* The Son of God is described as eternally existing with the Father. His life is not limited to a human lifespan but extends beyond time itself. 
* Human sons are mortal and eventually experience death. 
* The Son of God's eternal nature reflects his divine essence and his role as the eternal Son of God.


**Biblical References:**

* "For in him [Jesus] the fullness of deity dwells bodily" (Colossians 2:9).
* "I am the Son of God" (Matthew 26:70).
* "No one has ever seen God; but the Son, who is closest to the Father, has made him known" (John 1:18).

**Therefore, the Son of God stands apart from human sons in his divine nature, eternal existence, and unique relationship with the Father.**
