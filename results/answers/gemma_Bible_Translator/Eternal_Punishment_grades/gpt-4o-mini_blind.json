  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a strong theological understanding of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice. They correctly emphasize the justice of God in punishing sin, the importance of protecting the innocent, and the necessity of upholding God's character of justice and holiness. The inclusion of justice as a means of redemption and preparation for the new creation is commendable. However, it would be beneficial for the student to further emphasize God's holiness and the seriousness of sin in relation to eternal punishment. Additionally, connecting the concept of justice in hell to the overarching narrative of God's redemptive plan could strengthen the response. Overall, a solid explanation with room for deeper theological reflection."
