  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-structured explanation of how eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice from various angles. They address the concerns about divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences effectively. However, the student's answer could have been more focused on the Christian-specific belief that belief in Jesus' sacrifice is the key determinant for eternal punishment in hell. This key aspect could have been highlighted more clearly to align closely with the teacher's reference answer."
