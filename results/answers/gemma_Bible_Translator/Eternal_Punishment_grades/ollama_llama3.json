  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern about divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences, providing a comprehensive explanation of why eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice. The writer provides five points that demonstrate how eternal punishment serves as a means of justice for sin, protects the innocent, demonstrates God's character, enables redemption, and prepares for the new creation.\n\nThe response also clarifies that the concept of eternal punishment is not intended to be vengeful or cruel, but rather a just and loving response to the reality of sin. This nuance adds depth and balance to the discussion, acknowledging both the severity of God's justice and His desire for redemption and reconciliation.\n\nOne area for improvement could be to provide more explicit biblical support for each point, as the current response relies primarily on general theological principles rather than specific scriptural passages. Nevertheless, the overall quality of the response is high, and it effectively addresses the concern about divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences."
