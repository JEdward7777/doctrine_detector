The student demonstrated a good understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and presented thoughtful insights on the relationship between Jesus' words and the practice of celibacy. The student appropriately highlighted the voluntary nature of celibacy and the focus on spiritual development rather than coercion or punishment. Overall, a strong response with only minor areas for improvement."
