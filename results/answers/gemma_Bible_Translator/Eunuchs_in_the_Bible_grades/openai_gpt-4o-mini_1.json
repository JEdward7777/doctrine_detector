The explanation aligns with a Christian worldview by highlighting the importance of personal choice in celibacy and the focus on spiritual development. However, it could have been strengthened by delving deeper into the biblical perspective on celibacy and referencing more specific biblical passages that support the idea of celibacy as a valid choice for the Kingdom of Heaven."
