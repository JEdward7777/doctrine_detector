  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of what it means to exalt God in daily life, covering various aspects such as recognizing God's supremacy, gratitude, authenticity, obedience, dependence on God, and glorifying God in everyday actions. While the student's answer goes beyond the reference answer by delving into specific actions and attitudes that demonstrate exalting God, it may have slightly missed the simplicity of the reference answer which emphasized praising and honoring God through worship, prayer, and living according to His will. The additional depth and examples in the student's response are commendable, but could have been more concise to align closely with the essence of exalting God."
