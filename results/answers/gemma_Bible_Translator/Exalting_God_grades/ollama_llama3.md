I would give this response a grade of 85.

While the response provides a general definition of exalting God, it does not fully capture the depth and breadth of the concept as outlined in the original answer. The concern about understanding the importance of exalting God above all else is somewhat addressed in the response, but could be further developed.

The response does touch on various aspects of exalting God, such as worship, prayer, and obedience to His will. However, it could benefit from more specific examples or illustrations to demonstrate how these actions manifest in everyday life. Additionally, the response could delve deeper into the implications of exalting God above all else, exploring what this might look like in different contexts and situations.

Overall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the concept of exalting God, but could be further developed and nuanced to more fully address the concern and provide practical applications.
