They provide a clear explanation of the moral lessons embedded in the parable and its relevance today, aligning well with Christian theological truths. However, the response would be improved by directly addressing the concern by detailing how the parable's teachings on humility and repentance are relevant in contemporary society and how individuals can apply these lessons in their daily lives."
