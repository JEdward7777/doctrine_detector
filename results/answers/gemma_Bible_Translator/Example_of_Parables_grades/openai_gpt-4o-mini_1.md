## An Example: The Pharisee and the Tax Collector

**Parable:**

"Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing far off, prayed, 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, adulterers, or even like that tax collector there!' And the tax collector, beating his chest, prayed, 'God, be merciful to me, for I am a sinner.'" (Luke 18:9-14)

**Significance:**

This parable highlights the difference between humility and self-righteousness. The Pharisee, who considered himself morally superior, boasted about his righteousness while the tax collector, aware of his sins, humbled himself before God.

**The Lesson:**

- Humility before God is essential for prayer and salvation.
- True righteousness comes from acknowledging our sinfulness and accepting God's grace.
- God delights in the humble and accepts only sincere repentance.

**Christian Theological Truth:**

This parable teaches a crucial aspect of Christian theology: the need for humility and repentance before God. It aligns with the teachings of Jesus Christ, who emphasized the importance of humility and compassion in His ministry and teachings.

**Honest Answer:**

The parable demonstrates the importance of honest self-reflection and humility in our relationship with God. It encourages us to examine our hearts and acknowledge any areas of sin or pride. This honesty is essential for genuine faith and transformation in Christ.
