There are several instances in the New Testament where demon possession is described, such as in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Thus, a more accurate response would have acknowledged the presence of demon possession in the biblical texts while also addressing the diversity of beliefs among Christian denominations regarding this topic."
