  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a solid list of examples from the Bible demonstrating the concept of guilt, supported by relevant scripture references. The connections between each example and the feeling of guilt or remorse were accurately presented. The inclusion of the Ten Commandments as a source of guilt and punishment was a good addition to the response, tying in the concept of guilt to God's laws. Overall, a well-structured and thorough answer with strong biblical support. Great job!"
