  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided multiple examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt and connected them well to disobedience, sin, and violation of God's laws. However, the student missed including an example that directly addresses the concern of justice and innocence as Pilate declaring Jesus innocent despite the accusations. It is important to recognize the need for divine judgment in understanding guilt in the biblical context, and this example would have strengthened the overall response."
