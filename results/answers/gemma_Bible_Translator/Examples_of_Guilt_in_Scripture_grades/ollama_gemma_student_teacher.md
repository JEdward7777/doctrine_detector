## Examples from the Bible demonstrating the concept of guilt:

**1. The Fall of Man:**

* Genesis 3:24 describes the state of humanity after Adam and Eve disobeyed God: "And they knew that they were naked." This implies a sense of shame and guilt for their transgression.

**2. David's Sin with Bathsheba:**

* Psalm 32:3-4 reveals David's deep remorse for his adultery with Bathsheba: "When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my guilt... I will confess my transgressions to the Lord."

**3. Judas' Betrayal of Jesus:**

* Matthew 27:4-5 shows Judas' regret after betraying Jesus: "He regretted that he had given them up... He went and hanged himself."

**4. Peter's Denial of Jesus:**

* Matthew 26:70-75 demonstrates Peter's immense guilt after denying Jesus three times: "For I cannot endure the shame of all of them."

**5. Paul's Conversion:**

* Acts 23:1-3 describes Paul's initial response to his conversion: "I am a Pharisee, a son of the Pharisees... I punish others for their sins as I myself observed." This reflects Paul's sense of personal responsibility for his past actions.

**6. The Parable of the Prodigal Son:**

* Luke 15:17-18 illustrates the immense guilt felt by the prodigal son when he realizes the extent of his disobedience: "I am no longer worthy to be called your son... I am filled with great sorrow and punishment."

**7. The Ten Commandments:**

* The breaking of any of the Ten Commandments is associated with guilt and punishment (Exodus 32:32).

These examples demonstrate the consistent theme of guilt in the Bible as a natural response to disobedience, sin, and violation of God's laws.
