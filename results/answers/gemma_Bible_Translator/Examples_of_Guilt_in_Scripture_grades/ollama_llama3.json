While it mentions Pilate declaring Jesus innocent despite accusations (Luke 23:4-7) and the robber acknowledging their own guilt compared to Jesus (Luke 23:41), these examples do not specifically illustrate how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, as requested.\n\nThe response could have strengthened its connection to the concern by exploring how the biblical concept of guilt relates to divine judgment. For instance, it could have discussed how guilt serves as a motivator for individuals to seek forgiveness and reconciliation with God, rather than simply acknowledging sin without seeking restoration.\n\nWhile the response does demonstrate some understanding of guilt in the Bible, it falls short of fully addressing the concern about justice and innocence."
