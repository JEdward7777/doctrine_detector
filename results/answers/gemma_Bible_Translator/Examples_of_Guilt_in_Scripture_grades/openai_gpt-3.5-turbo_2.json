  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides comprehensive examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt in various contexts. However, it slightly misses addressing the concern raised about how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, as it focuses more on individual examples without explicitly tying them back to the need for divine judgment. Overall, the response is thorough and well-supported with relevant biblical passages."
