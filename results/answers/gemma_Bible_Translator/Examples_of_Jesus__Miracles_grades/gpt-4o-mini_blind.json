  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of specific miracles performed by Jesus and their significance, showing a good understanding of the doctrinal significance of each miracle. The examples given align well with the biblical accounts and the theological implications of each miracle are accurately explained. Additionally, the response is structured and clearly organized. The only room for improvement would be to include more scriptural references to support the significance of each miracle. Overall, a very strong and well-presented answer."
