  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed list of Jesus' miracles along with their significance, showcasing a strong understanding of their importance in affirming Jesus as the Son of God. The only improvement could be to more directly tie the miracles to the signs of Jesus' divinity and God's kingdom mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a solid and well-supported response."
