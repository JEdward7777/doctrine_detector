  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the relationship between trust and faith in the context of Christian belief. They effectively highlighted the individual characteristics of trust and faith, demonstrated their interconnection, and provided biblical examples to support their points. The student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer by emphasizing the importance of trust in relation to faith. The grade could be higher if the student had directly incorporated the teacher's reference answer into their explanation for a more direct comparison."
