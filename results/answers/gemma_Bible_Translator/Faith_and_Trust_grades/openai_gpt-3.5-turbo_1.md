**Trust:**

* Refers to a firm belief in the reliability and trustworthiness of God's Word and character.
* Involves acknowledging God's power and sovereignty, while resting in his faithfulness and love.
* Trust is a foundational element of prayer, as we confidently approach God with our needs and requests.

**Faith:**

* Is a complete trust in God's salvation plan through Jesus Christ.
* It involves believing in God's promises, such as forgiveness of sins and eternal life.
* Faith is not merely intellectual assent but a deep personal conviction that God is real and loves us.

**The Relationship:**
