The response effectively tackles the concern by highlighting how faith and trust in Jesus should manifest in one's personal life. The only minor improvement would be adding a touch more emphasis on the personal relationship aspect of believing in Jesus, but overall, the response is thorough and well-aligned with a Christian worldview."
