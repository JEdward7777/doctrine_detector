The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life. However, a slightly higher grade could be achieved by further emphasizing the importance of acknowledging Jesus as fully God and fully man, as well as incorporating the significance of His resurrection and the necessity of faith for receiving salvation.
