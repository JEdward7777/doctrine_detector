Grade: 85

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed answer on how true faith in Jesus manifests in a person's life, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The response covers aspects such as repentance, love for God and others, the fruit of the Spirit, witnessing transformation, obedience to God's call, and ongoing growth. However, the concern specifically focused on recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life, and the student's answer does not directly address this aspect. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes that true faith will produce good spiritual fruits or behaviors because the Holy Spirit resides within the individual. The student's response, although thorough, could have been enhanced by directly linking the manifestation of faith to the evidence of good fruits and behaviors in daily life as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer.
