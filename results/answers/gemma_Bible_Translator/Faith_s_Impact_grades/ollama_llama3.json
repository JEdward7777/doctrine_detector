  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response acknowledges that true faith produces good spiritual fruits or behaviors, which aligns with concern about recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life. However, it does not provide as much detail and specific examples as the given answer. The given answer provides a more comprehensive list of manifestations of true faith, including repentance, love for God and others, obedience to God's call, and ongoing growth.\n\nThe response also lacks depth in its explanation of how the Holy Spirit living in an individual produces good spiritual fruits or behaviors. It does not provide any specific examples or biblical references to support this claim.\n\nOverall, while the response is a good start, it could be improved by providing more detail and specific examples of manifestations of true faith in daily life."
