  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively addresses the concerns raised regarding favoritism from a biblical perspective. They incorporate relevant scriptures and Christian principles to support their points and offer practical steps for application. The student's response aligns with Christian teachings on impartiality and love for all, emphasizing the negative impact of favoritism on relationships. However, the student could have more directly tied their answer back to the reference definition of favoritism provided by the teacher to fully align with the given concern."
