  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer, with appropriate biblical references and examples to support their explanation. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on the core aspect of being approved by the person to whom favor is sought. The response touched on important aspects such as obedience, humility, and mutual benefit, but could have been more closely aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
