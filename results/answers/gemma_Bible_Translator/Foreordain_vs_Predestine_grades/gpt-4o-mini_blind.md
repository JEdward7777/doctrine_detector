## [Answer](../Foreordain_vs_Predestine.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
While both terms, "foreordain" and "predestine," express the sovereignty of God in salvation, there are key differences between them.

**Foreordain:**

* Refers to God's predetermined action or purpose in the lives of individuals or events.
* Emphasizes God's action **before** the event or person's existence.
* Usually involves a specific act or calling, such as salvation, ministry, or a specific destiny.

**Predestine:**

* Means that God has chosen certain individuals for salvation before the foundation of the world.
* Focuses on God's electing love for his people.
* Often associated with the idea of "election" or "being chosen" for salvation.

**Relationship:**

While both terms highlight God's sovereignty, they represent different aspects of the same divine decree. Foreordination is the act of choosing, while predestination is the result of that choice - God's electing love for his people.

**Biblical Support:**

Both terms are found in the Bible:

* **Foreordain:** "He foreordained us for glory" (2 Timothy 1:9)
* **Predestine:** "For whom he did foreordain he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son" (Romans 8:29)

**Conclusion:**

Both "foreordain" and "predestine" are essential concepts in understanding God's sovereign work in salvation. While they are related, they represent different aspects of the same divine decree.
