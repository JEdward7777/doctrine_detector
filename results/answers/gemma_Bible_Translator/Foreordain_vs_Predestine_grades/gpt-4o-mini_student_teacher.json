  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of both \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" in the context of Christian teachings. They effectively clarified the relationship between these theological concepts and supported their explanation with relevant biblical references. The analysis was thorough and demonstrated a solid understanding of the subject matter. The only area for improvement would be to directly address the teacher's reference answer in the conclusion for a more explicit comparison. Nonetheless, the response effectively addresses the concern and provides a comprehensive explanation."
