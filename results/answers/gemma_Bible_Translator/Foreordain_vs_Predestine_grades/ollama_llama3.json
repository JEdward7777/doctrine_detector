  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the differences between \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\", providing clear definitions, biblical support, and a thoughtful conclusion that highlights their interconnectedness. The writer effectively clarifies the relationship between these concepts by highlighting the distinction between foreordination as an act and predestination as its result. The use of scripture to illustrate each term also adds depth and authority to the response.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the introduction, which could be strengthened with a more nuanced explanation of how these terms relate to the broader concept of God's sovereignty in salvation. Nevertheless, the writer demonstrates a strong understanding of the subject matter and presents it in a clear, organized, and engaging manner."
