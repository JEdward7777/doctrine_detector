  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough comparison between \"foreordain\" and \"predestine,\" explaining their distinct meanings, biblical support, and relationship within theological concepts. The integration of scriptural references and the clear distinction between the two terms demonstrate a solid understanding of Christian doctrine surrounding divine sovereignty and predestination. The response effectively addresses the concern raised by clarifying the relationship between these similar concepts in a concise and informative manner."
