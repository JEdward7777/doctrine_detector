They effectively highlighted the negative effects of such a mindset on a believer's understanding of grace, fear and anxiety, spiritual growth, and identity. Additionally, the student offered practical and biblically sound solutions for finding freedom, emphasizing God's forgiveness, repentance, grace-based living, self-forgiveness, embracing God's love, and focusing on His promises. Overall, this response aligns well with the Christian worldview and provides solid guidance for believers seeking to address sin in their lives for a deeper relationship with God."
