Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a concise and accurate definition of fulfilled prophecy from a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of alignment with biblical principles, specificity, benefit to God's people, biblical testimony, and consistency with other prophecies. It also references relevant biblical teachings on prophecy. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the role of God in causing the fulfillment of prophecies, in line with the belief in divine providence and sovereignty over history. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention the importance of God's agency in fulfilling prophecies within the response itself.
