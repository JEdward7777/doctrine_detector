  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-rounded perspective on the term \"holy place\" beyond physical structures like the tabernacle or temple. The student effectively connects the concept to spiritual realms, God's presence, corporate worship, interior life, and transformed communities. The biblical references add depth to the explanation. The answer could be strengthened by incorporating more specific biblical examples or principles to support each point, increasing the doctrinal depth of the analysis. Additionally, tying each point directly to specific scriptural passages would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
