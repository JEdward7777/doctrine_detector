**Evangelists are distinguished from other Christians by their primary focus:**

**1. Evangelism:**

* Evangelists prioritize sharing the Gospel message with others.
* Their primary goal is to lead people to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
* They often engage in public outreach, sharing their faith through preaching, teaching, and witnessing.

**2. Focus on Salvation:**

* Evangelists emphasize the need for salvation through Jesus Christ.
* They believe that Jesus' death and resurrection offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life.
* Their teachings center on accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior.

**3. Passion for Souls:**

* Evangelists have a deep concern for the spiritual well-being of others.
* They are motivated by a desire to see people come to know and follow Jesus.
* This passion often leads them to invest considerable time and energy in evangelistic outreach.

**4. Obedience to the Great Commission:**

* Evangelists recognize their responsibility to fulfill the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20), which commands followers of Jesus to make disciples of all nations.
* They actively share their faith with others and encourage them to do the same.

**5. Public Witness:**

* Evangelists often engage in public discussions about their faith.
* They are willing to share their beliefs and defend their faith in a respectful and open manner.

**Other Christians, while also devoted to their faith, may not prioritize these aspects as extensively as evangelists.** Their primary focus may be on personal spiritual growth, fellowship, or serving their communities.
