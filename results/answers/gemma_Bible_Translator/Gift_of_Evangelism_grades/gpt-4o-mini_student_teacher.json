  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-organized response highlighting key distinctions between evangelists and other Christians. However, the answer did not specifically address the concern regarding understanding the spiritual gifts related to evangelism and their role in the church. The reference answer emphasizes the special spiritual gift of evangelism that some Christians possess, which was not explicitly mentioned in the student's response. Moving forward, it would be beneficial for the student to incorporate this aspect into their explanation to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
