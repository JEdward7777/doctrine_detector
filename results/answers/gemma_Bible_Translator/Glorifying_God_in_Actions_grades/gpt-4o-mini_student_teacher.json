  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily lives, touching on obedience, gratitude, serving others, purity, humility, forgiveness, and witnessing through challenges. These points align well with the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness. However, the student's answer could have been more focused on the central theme of sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments to reflect His glory to others, as emphasized in the reference answer."
