  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This answer provides a solid explanation of Jesus' statement emphasizing God's goodness and highlighting the fallen nature of humanity. The theological concepts are well explained and supported by relevant Scriptures. However, the inclusion of more direct references to Jesus' deity and the necessity of salvation through Him could strengthen the argument further. Additionally, connecting the concept of God's goodness to the overarching narrative of salvation history would enhance the depth of the response. Overall, a strong theological understanding is demonstrated, but further development and integration of doctrinal nuances would elevate the answer."
