  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-detailed and comprehensive explanation of Jesus' statement regarding God's goodness and humanity's inherent inability to be truly good. They effectively connected the theological concepts within a Christian worldview. The answer aligned closely with the reference answer, but could have slightly emphasized the idea of God's moral perfection and righteousness as the ultimate standard of goodness a bit more explicitly. Overall, an excellent response demonstrating a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on goodness and God's nature."
