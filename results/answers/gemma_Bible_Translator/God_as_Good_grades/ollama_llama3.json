  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs, as it highlights God's intrinsic goodness and righteousness as the ultimate standard of goodness. It also correctly contrasts human nature with God's character, emphasizing humanity's inability to achieve true goodness on its own merit. The supporting scriptures provided further reinforce this understanding.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more explicit in acknowledging the dependence on God's grace and forgiveness through Christ. While it is implied in the conclusion, a stronger emphasis on this point would strengthen the overall argument. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a clear comprehension of Jesus' statement and its implications for recognizing the source of goodness.\n\nComment: The grade of 90 reflects the response's strengths in recognizing the source of goodness and effectively contrasting human nature with God's character. To achieve a perfect score, the response could be further developed to emphasize more explicitly the dependence on God's grace and forgiveness through Christ."
