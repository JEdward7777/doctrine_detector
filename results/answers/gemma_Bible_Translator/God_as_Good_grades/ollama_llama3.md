## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Jesus' statement, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God,' emphasizes two crucial theological concepts:**

**1. God's Goodness:**

* The statement highlights God's intrinsic goodness and righteousness. 
* Throughout Scripture, God is depicted as the source of all goodness, compassion, and love. 
* His goodness extends to his character, actions, and motivations.

**2. Man's Inability to Be Good:**

* Jesus is contrasting his own goodness with the fallen nature of humanity. 
* Humans are inherently sinful and unable to achieve true goodness on their own merit. 
* Our attempts to be good are often marred by selfishness, pride, and disobedience.

**Interpretation:**

* Jesus' words teach us that true goodness is found in God alone. 
* His goodness is perfectly revealed in his life, death, and resurrection. 
* Through Christ's sacrifice, God offers forgiveness of sins and a new life in him, enabling us to experience true and lasting goodness.

**Supporting Scriptures:**

* "For we know that God is the source of good things. He does not change like shifting shadows." (James 1:17)
* "Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect." (Matthew 5:48)
* "There is no one righteous, not even one." (Romans 3:10)

**Conclusion:**

Jesus' statement emphasizes the fundamental difference between God and humanity. Only God is truly good, while humans are unable to achieve true goodness on their own. This understanding leads to a profound dependence on God's grace and forgiveness through Christ.

90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response does an excellent job of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs, as it highlights God's intrinsic goodness and righteousness as the ultimate standard of goodness. It also correctly contrasts human nature with God's character, emphasizing humanity's inability to achieve true goodness on its own merit. The supporting scriptures provided further reinforce this understanding.

The only area for improvement is that the response could be more explicit in acknowledging the dependence on God's grace and forgiveness through Christ. While it is implied in the conclusion, a stronger emphasis on this point would strengthen the overall argument. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a clear comprehension of Jesus' statement and its implications for recognizing the source of goodness.

Comment: The grade of 90 reflects the response's strengths in recognizing the source of goodness and effectively contrasting human nature with God's character. To achieve a perfect score, the response could be further developed to emphasize more explicitly the dependence on God's grace and forgiveness through Christ.
