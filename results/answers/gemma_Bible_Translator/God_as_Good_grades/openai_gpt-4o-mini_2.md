# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Jesus' statement, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God,' emphasizes two crucial theological concepts:**

**1. God's Goodness:**

* The statement highlights God's intrinsic goodness and righteousness. 
* Throughout Scripture, God is depicted as the source of all goodness, compassion, and love. 
* His goodness extends to his character, actions, and motivations.

**2. Man's Inability to Be Good:**

* Jesus is contrasting his own goodness with the fallen nature of humanity. 
* Humans are inherently sinful and unable to achieve true goodness on their own merit. 
* Our attempts to be good are often marred by selfishness, pride, and disobedience.

**Interpretation:**

* Jesus' words teach us that true goodness is found in God alone. 
* His goodness is perfectly revealed in his life, death, and resurrection. 
* Through Christ's sacrifice, God offers forgiveness of sins and a new life in him, enabling us to experience true and lasting goodness.

**Supporting Scriptures:**

* "For we know that God is the source of good things. He does not change like shifting shadows." (James 1:17)
* "Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect." (Matthew 5:48)
* "There is no one righteous, not even one." (Romans 3:10)

**Conclusion:**

Jesus' statement emphasizes the fundamental difference between God and humanity. Only God is truly good, while humans are unable to achieve true goodness on their own. This understanding leads to a profound dependence on God's grace and forgiveness through Christ.
