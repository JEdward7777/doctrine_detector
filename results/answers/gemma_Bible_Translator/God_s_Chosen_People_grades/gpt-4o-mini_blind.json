  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of a 'remnant' and God's selective grace in both the Old and New Testaments. The biblical support is well-referenced and the interpretation is sound, emphasizing God's sovereignty in salvation. The implications drawn from the concept are practical and in line with Christian teachings. The mention of balancing truths shows an awareness of the full counsel of scripture. The response could further emphasize the importance of responding to God's call and living a life that reflects His grace. Overall, a solid and doctrinally correct analysis."
