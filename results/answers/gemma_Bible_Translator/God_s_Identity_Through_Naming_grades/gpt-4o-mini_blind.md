Comment: This response provides a strong explanation of how the concept of being "called by my name" reflects the believer's relationship with God from a Christian worldview. The student effectively connects the concept to God's sovereign choice in salvation, the idea of a personal relationship with God, the specific purpose God has for believers, empowerment and authenticity in our faith, and the accountability we have as individuals known by God. The inclusion of relevant biblical examples further supports the points made. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a bit more scriptural support throughout the response to strengthen the theological foundation. Overall, a well-written and insightful answer.
