  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how the concept of being \"called by my name\" reflects our relationship with God in various aspects such as God's sovereign choice, personal relationship, specific purpose, empowerment, authenticity, and accountability. The biblical examples and conclusion further support their points. However, the student's answer may have delved too deeply into the implications rather than focusing on the core concept of belonging to God and the personal relationship it signifies, as stated in the teacher's reference answer."
