  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of highlighting the intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity, specifically in the context of His calling. The writer provides clear biblical examples and breaks down the significance of intentionality or purpose in God's calling, emphasizing that it aligns with His divine plan, is selective, empowers individuals, is transformative, and ongoing.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to expand on the connection between God's calling and His sovereignty, as hinted at in point 2. A more explicit explanation of how God's intentional calling relates to His all-knowing, all-powerful nature could strengthen this response further. Nevertheless, this response is well-organized, thoroughly supported by Scripture, and effectively communicates the importance of recognizing the intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity."
