**The significance of intentionality or purpose in God's calling is crucial for understanding Christian theological truth.**

**1. God's calling aligns with his divine purpose:**

* The term "call" emphasizes that God's calling is not merely an event but a deliberate action with a specific purpose.
* God has a grand plan for each individual, and his calling aligns perfectly with that plan.

**2. God's calling is intentional and selective:**

* God's calling is not indiscriminate. He selectively chooses individuals for specific purposes.
* This intentionality demonstrates God's sovereignty and his desire to work in powerful ways through his chosen people.

**3. God's calling empowers individuals:**

* The idea of a "call" implies responsibility and empowerment.
* When God calls someone, he equips them with the necessary gifts and abilities to fulfill their purpose.

**4. God's calling is transformative:**

* God's calling is not merely an external event but an internal transformation.
* Those who are called are transformed into the image of Christ through the Holy Spirit's work.

**5. God's calling is ongoing:**

* The term "call" suggests an ongoing process rather than a one-time event.
* God continues to call individuals throughout history to serve him and advance his kingdom.

**Biblical Examples:**

* In the New Testament, Paul describes himself as "called by God" (1 Corinthians 1:1).
* Jesus said, "Follow me, for I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).
