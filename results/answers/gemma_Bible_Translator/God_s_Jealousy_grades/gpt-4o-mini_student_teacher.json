  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 95.\n\nThe student provides a thorough explanation of the concept of God's jealousy, grounding it in biblical context and theological understanding. They address key points such as the motivation behind God's jealousy, its implications for believers, and the various interpretations found in scripture. The response effectively highlights the importance of understanding God's jealousy in relation to His character and desire for spiritual fidelity.\n\nWhile the answer is comprehensive and well-structured, the student could strengthen their response by incorporating more direct references to scripture to support their points. This would further enhance the biblical foundation of their explanation."
