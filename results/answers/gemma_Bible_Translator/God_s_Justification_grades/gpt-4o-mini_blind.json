The student effectively references key biblical passages and accurately outlines the process and implications of justification. The emphasis on grace, faith, and the work of Jesus Christ in the process of justification is commendable. Additionally, the inclusion of how justification impacts believers' lives and the importance of gratitude and humility before God is well articulated. Overall, a very strong answer."
