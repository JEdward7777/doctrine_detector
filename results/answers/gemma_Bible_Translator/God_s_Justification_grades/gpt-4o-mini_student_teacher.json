  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained response on the Christian doctrine of justification. They have effectively outlined the biblical basis, process, key aspects, and implications of justification in a clear and informative manner. The inclusion of key passages from the Bible strengthens their answer. The only area for improvement is to directly link their description back to the importance of justification in salvation, as per the specified concern."
