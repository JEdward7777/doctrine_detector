  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. The student has provided a thorough explanation of the term \"Almighty\" by discussing both omnipotence and sovereignty as attributes of God. They have correctly highlighted the unlimited power and supreme rulership of God in alignment with the Christian worldview. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of understanding God's omnipotence in relation to faith and worship, as mentioned in the specified concern. Overall, it is a well-articulated response that demonstrates a sound understanding of the topic."
