## [Answer](../God_s_Power.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Almighty" signifies an attribute of God that encompasses two key aspects: **omnipotence and sovereignty.**

**Omnipotence:**

* Means God has **unlimited power** to do absolutely anything that aligns with His character and purpose. 
* This includes creating and sustaining the universe, rescuing people from sin and death, and answering prayer. 
* The believer can find comfort in knowing that God's power is more than sufficient for any situation.

**Sovereignty:**

* Means God is the **supreme ruler and owner of everything** in heaven and on earth. 
* This includes all events, circumstances, and people. 
* God's sovereignty ensures that His purposes will ultimately be fulfilled, even when things seem difficult or beyond human control.

Therefore, the term "Almighty" reveals that God is not merely powerful, but that He is also the ultimate authority and ruler. This understanding should inspire believers to trust in His power and sovereignty, knowing that He is always working for their good.
