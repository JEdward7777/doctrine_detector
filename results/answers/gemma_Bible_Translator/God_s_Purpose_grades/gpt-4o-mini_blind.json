The emphasis on humility, prayer, and seeking God's guidance through His Word is commendable. However, to enhance the answer, the student could have included more specific examples of how to apply these principles in discerning God's plans and emphasized the role of the Holy Spirit in the process. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound response."
