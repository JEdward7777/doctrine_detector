  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response provides some good insights on discerning God's plan, mentioning prayer, reading the Bible, seeking counsel from mature Christians, and observing circumstances. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its application of biblical principles.\n\nWhile the concern about spiritual uncertainty is addressed to some extent, the response could benefit from a more detailed exploration of how to overcome this uncertainty. For example, the importance of understanding God's character and promises, as well as seeking balance and wisdom, are not explicitly mentioned.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a basic understanding of Christian principles but could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples and biblical support for its claims."
