These align well with the Christian worldview of relying on God's guidance and seeking wisdom from others. However, considering the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose, the response could have emphasized the importance of Scripture as the ultimate authority and seeking God's character and promises for clarity and direction in times of uncertainty."
