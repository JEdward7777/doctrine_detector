  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 85. \n\nWhile the student provided a well-researched and comprehensive answer detailing various passages where God introduces Himself through His name in the Bible, and discussed the significance of God's name in terms of identity, authority, intimacy, and accessibility, they did not focus specifically on the name 'Yahweh' as emphasized in the reference answer. \n\nThe reference answer underlines the importance of the name 'Yahweh' in revealing God's identity and His covenant relationship with His people. While the student included various passages and interpretations, a more focused discussion on the significance of the name 'Yahweh' would have aligned more closely with the specific concern provided."
