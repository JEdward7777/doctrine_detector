## [Answer](../God_s_Revelation.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**God introduces Himself using His name in the Bible through various passages:**

**1. Exodus 3:14:** "I am the Lord your God." This is the first time God reveals His name to Moses and the Israelites.

**2. Isaiah 40:25:** "I am the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth." This passage emphasizes God's sovereignty and creativity.

**3. John 1:1-2:** "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning." This passage reveals that Jesus Christ is the Word and is eternally associated with God.

**4. Revelation 1:8:** "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end." This passage highlights God's eternal nature.

**5. Various Psalms:** Many Psalms contain references to God's name, such as Psalm 8:1 "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want." and Psalm 23:1 "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."

**The significance of God's name:**

* **Divine identity:** God's name reveals His unique identity and attributes.
* **Divine authority:** God's name represents His power and sovereignty.
* **Divine intimacy:** God's name is a expression of His love and grace.
* **Divine accessibility:** God's name invites us to approach Him in prayer and worship.

**Biblical interpretations:**

* **The tetragrammaton:** The four-letter name of God in Hebrew (Yahweh) is considered too sacred to be spoken by humans.
* **Jesus' name:** Jesus Christ is often referred to as the "name above every name" (Philippians 2:9-11).

**Conclusion:**

God's introduction of Himself using His name in the Bible is a profound revelation of His character and purpose. His name is a source of identity, authority, intimacy, and accessibility to believers.
