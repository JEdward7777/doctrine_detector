**God's Role in the Process of a Person Being Born Again:**

The new birth in Christianity is a transformative work of the Holy Spirit, initiated and completed by God.

**1. God Initiates the Process:**

* John 3:5 teaches that "no one can be born again until he first sees the Son." This implies that God sovereignly draws individuals to himself.
* God's love for the world compels him to send his Son to save us (John 3:16).

**2. God Provides the Necessary Power:**

* The Holy Spirit is the "Spirit of rebirth" (John 3:5). He convicts people of their sin, reveals the need for salvation through Christ, and empowers them to believe.
* The Holy Spirit works alongside the Word of God to bring about spiritual regeneration.

**3. God Completes the Process:**

* The new birth is not merely an intellectual assent but a complete transformation of the heart and life.
* God himself effects the change, writing the law of his love on the hearts of believers (2 Corinthians 3:3).

**Biblical References:**

* John 3:3-5, 16
* 2 Corinthians 3:3
* Ephesians 2:8-9

**Process of New Birth:**

1. Conviction of sin
2. Belief in Jesus Christ
3. Regeneration by the Holy Spirit
4. Transformation of the heart and life

**Conclusion:**

The new birth is a miraculous work of God's grace, initiated, empowered, and completed by the Holy Spirit. Christians believe that through faith in Jesus Christ, God gives new life to those who were once spiritually dead.
