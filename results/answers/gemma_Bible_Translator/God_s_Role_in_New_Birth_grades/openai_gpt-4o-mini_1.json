The biblical references are appropriately used to support the theological points made, and the explanation is thorough and scripturally grounded. The emphasis on God's sovereignty and grace in salvation aligns well with the specified concern. The response could have further elaborated on the concept of faith as a response to God's grace in the process of new birth, but overall, it provides a solid Christian perspective on the topic."
