  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-structured answer discussing various biblical passages, theological interpretations, and Christian beliefs regarding God's punishment during the Day of Yahweh. However, the answer could have been strengthened by focusing more on the specific concern of recognizing the nature of God's judgment and the consequences for disbelief. Additionally, the provided reference answer from the teacher emphasizes the aspect of God's wrath being poured out upon unbelievers, which was not explicitly highlighted in the student's response."
