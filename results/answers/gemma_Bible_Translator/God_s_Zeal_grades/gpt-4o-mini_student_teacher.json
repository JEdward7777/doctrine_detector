  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85 \n\nComment: The student provided a well-developed and comprehensive analysis of how the term \"zeal of the Lord\" reflects God's actions towards His people, utilizing relevant biblical examples, theological insights, and practical applications. The student effectively connected God's zeal with His love, justice, and protective care for His people. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern of deepening believers' trust in God's commitment to their well-being, as specified in the reference answer. Overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept but could have been more aligned with the concern provided."
