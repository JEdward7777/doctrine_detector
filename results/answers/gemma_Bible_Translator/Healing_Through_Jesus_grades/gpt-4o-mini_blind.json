  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals according to the Bible. The student accurately highlights Jesus' compassion, authority, use of prayer, engagement in spiritual warfare, and focus on restoration and reconciliation. The theological significance section effectively connects Jesus' actions to deeper spiritual truths. However, there could have been more emphasis on the importance of faith in the healing process and a clearer distinction between the use of olive oil and birch branches as symbolic tools in exorcisms with biblical backing. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
