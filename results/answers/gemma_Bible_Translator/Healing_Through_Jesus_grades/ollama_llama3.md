I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response correctly acknowledges Jesus' authority over evil spirits, which addresses the concern about recognizing Jesus' power over demons. However, it only mentions one aspect of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals, namely commanding the demons to come out. It does not provide a comprehensive understanding of Jesus' methods, such as his compassion and empathy for those afflicted, his requirement of faith from those being healed, or his engagement in spiritual warfare.

The response also lacks biblical references and theological significance, which are important components of a well-rounded discussion on this topic. Overall, while the response does touch on an important aspect of Jesus' ministry, it does not demonstrate a thorough understanding of the subject matter.
