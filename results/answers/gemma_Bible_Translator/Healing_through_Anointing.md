## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The practice of anointing is not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament as a means of healing.** However, the biblical accounts of Jesus and his disciples suggest that prayer and faith play a central role in healing.

**Biblical references to anointing:**

* In the Old Testament, anointing with oil was a ritual used to symbolize divine ordination or blessing (e.g., 1 Samuel 16:13).
* In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the "anointed one" (Messiah) because he received God's blessing and power (e.g., Acts 10:38).

**Healing in the New Testament:**

* The New Testament records numerous instances of Jesus healing people of various ailments (e.g., Mark 1:32-34).
* The apostles and early Christians also performed healing miracles (e.g., Acts 4:33).
* Healing is often mentioned as a result of prayer and faith (e.g., James 5:14-15).

**Therefore, while anointing is not explicitly mentioned as a means of healing in the New Testament, prayer, faith, and the power of God are believed to be essential for healing in Christian faith.**
