The explanation of anointing in both the Old and New Testaments was clear and relevant. However, the statement that anointing is not explicitly mentioned as a means of healing in the New Testament is not entirely accurate - James 5:14-15 does specifically mention anointing with oil in the context of healing. The student could have also delved deeper into the significance of anointing in the context of healing miracles performed by Jesus and the apostles. A more thorough exploration of biblical examples and theology surrounding anointing in healing would have strengthened the response."
