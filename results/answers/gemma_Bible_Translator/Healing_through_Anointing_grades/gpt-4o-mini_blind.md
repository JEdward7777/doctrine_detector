## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The practice of anointing is not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament as a means of healing.** However, the biblical accounts of Jesus and his disciples suggest that prayer and faith play a central role in healing.

**Biblical references to anointing:**

* In the Old Testament, anointing with oil was a ritual used to symbolize divine ordination or blessing (e.g., 1 Samuel 16:13).
* In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the "anointed one" (Messiah) because he received God's blessing and power (e.g., Acts 10:38).

**Healing in the New Testament:**

* The New Testament records numerous instances of Jesus healing people of various ailments (e.g., Mark 1:32-34).
* The apostles and early Christians also performed healing miracles (e.g., Acts 4:33).
* Healing is often mentioned as a result of prayer and faith (e.g., James 5:14-15).

**Therefore, while anointing is not explicitly mentioned as a means of healing in the New Testament, prayer, faith, and the power of God are believed to be essential for healing in Christian faith.**

Comment: The student provided a solid overview of the relationship between anointing and healing in the New Testament. The explanation of anointing in both the Old and New Testaments was clear and relevant. However, the statement that anointing is not explicitly mentioned as a means of healing in the New Testament is not entirely accurate - James 5:14-15 does specifically mention anointing with oil in the context of healing. The student could have also delved deeper into the significance of anointing in the context of healing miracles performed by Jesus and the apostles. A more thorough exploration of biblical examples and theology surrounding anointing in healing would have strengthened the response.
