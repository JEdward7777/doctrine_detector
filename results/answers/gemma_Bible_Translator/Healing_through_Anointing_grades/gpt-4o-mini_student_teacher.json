  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and informative answer linking anointing, healing, and Christian practice. However, they missed the key point that anointing with oil for seeking healing is explicitly mentioned in the New Testament. This explicit connection is essential in understanding the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice. The student did well in discussing the broader aspects related to healing in the New Testament and the importance of prayer, faith, and the power of God, but they should have directly addressed the role of anointing in seeking healing according to the reference answer given by the teacher."
