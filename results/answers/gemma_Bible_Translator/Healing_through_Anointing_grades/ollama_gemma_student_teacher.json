However, it could benefit from further elaboration on the practical application of anointing in Christian practice, specifically addressing how it was used for physical healing in early Christianity. Additionally, the student's answer could have provided more direct engagement with the given concern by explicitly acknowledging the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice."
