# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The practice of anointing is not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament as a means of healing.** However, the biblical accounts of Jesus and his disciples suggest that prayer and faith play a central role in healing.

**Biblical references to anointing:**

* In the Old Testament, anointing with oil was a ritual used to symbolize divine ordination or blessing (e.g., 1 Samuel 16:13).
* In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the "anointed one" (Messiah) because he received God's blessing and power (e.g., Acts 10:38).

**Healing in the New Testament:**

* The New Testament records numerous instances of Jesus healing people of various ailments (e.g., Mark 1:32-34).
* The apostles and early Christians also performed healing miracles (e.g., Acts 4:33).
* Healing is often mentioned as a result of prayer and faith (e.g., James 5:14-15).

**Therefore, while anointing is not explicitly mentioned as a means of healing in the New Testament, prayer, faith, and the power of God are believed to be essential for healing in Christian faith.**

Comment: The response provided a good overview of the biblical references to anointing and healing in the New Testament while emphasizing prayer, faith, and God's power as essential components. However, the response did not directly address the concern of recognizing the specific role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice. There could have been a clearer connection made between the biblical references to anointing and the practice of anointing for seeking healing in Christian tradition.
