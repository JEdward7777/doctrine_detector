It correctly points out that anointing is not explicitly mentioned as a means of healing in the New Testament but highlights the importance of prayer, faith, and God's power in the healing process. However, the response could have further emphasized the symbolic and spiritual significance of anointing in seeking God's intervention and healing power in alignment with Christian practice."
