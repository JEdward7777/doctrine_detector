## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Only two individuals were ever permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Moses**

* God specifically commanded Moses to approach the ark and consult with it during times of crisis and decision-making (Exodus 24:1-4).

**2. The High Priest**

* In the later prophetic periods, the High Priest was permitted to approach the ark once a year on the Day of Atonement to perform sacrifices and prayers (Leviticus 16:1-3). 

**Neither the common people nor any other individual was permitted to approach the ark without incurring severe punishment.** The proximity of the ark was associated with immense power and glory, and access was strictly limited to those whom God had specifically designated.
