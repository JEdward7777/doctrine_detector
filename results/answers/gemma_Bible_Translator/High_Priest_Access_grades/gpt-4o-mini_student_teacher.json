However, the student included Moses as one of the individuals allowed to approach the ark, which was not accurate according to the Christian biblical narrative. Moses was not granted permission to approach the ark; rather, he interacted with God directly in other contexts. It is crucial to differentiate between Moses' interactions with God and the specific role of the high priest in approaching the ark."
