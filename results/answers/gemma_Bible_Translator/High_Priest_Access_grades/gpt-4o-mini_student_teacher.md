## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Only two individuals were ever permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Moses**

* God specifically commanded Moses to approach the ark and consult with it during times of crisis and decision-making (Exodus 24:1-4).

**2. The High Priest**

* In the later prophetic periods, the High Priest was permitted to approach the ark once a year on the Day of Atonement to perform sacrifices and prayers (Leviticus 16:1-3). 

**Neither the common people nor any other individual was permitted to approach the ark without incurring severe punishment.** The proximity of the ark was associated with immense power and glory, and access was strictly limited to those whom God had specifically designated.

Comment: The student provided a well-detailed response outlining the two individuals permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant, which aligns with the reference answer given by the teacher. However, the student included Moses as one of the individuals allowed to approach the ark, which was not accurate according to the Christian biblical narrative. Moses was not granted permission to approach the ark; rather, he interacted with God directly in other contexts. It is crucial to differentiate between Moses' interactions with God and the specific role of the high priest in approaching the ark.
