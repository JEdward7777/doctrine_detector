## Question [High Priest Access](../../../questions/High_Priest_Access.md)
Who was allowed to approach the ark of the covenant and under what circumstances?

## Correct Answer
Only the high priest could approach the ark, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant.

## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Only two individuals were ever permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Moses**

* God specifically commanded Moses to approach the ark and consult with it during times of crisis and decision-making (Exodus 24:1-4).

**2. The High Priest**

* In the later prophetic periods, the High Priest was permitted to approach the ark once a year on the Day of Atonement to perform sacrifices and prayers (Leviticus 16:1-3). 

**Neither the common people nor any other individual was permitted to approach the ark without incurring severe punishment.** The proximity of the ark was associated with immense power and glory, and access was strictly limited to those whom God had specifically designated.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response attempts to address the concern of recognizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant, but falls short in several areas. Firstly, it only mentions the High Priest's annual approach to the ark on the Day of Atonement, neglecting Moses' significant role as a mediator between God and the people (as highlighted in Exodus 24:1-4). Secondly, the response does not fully acknowledge the significance of Moses' relationship with God and his role as a leader in Israelite history. While it's accurate that only the High Priest could approach the ark annually on the Day of Atonement, the response would benefit from further elaboration on the High Priest's role in atoning for sin and maintaining covenantal relationships.

To achieve a higher grade, the response could have explored Moses' interactions with God more thoroughly, highlighting his unique position as a mediator between God and the people. Additionally, the response could have provided more context about the High Priest's role and significance within Israelite worship and the covenantal relationship.
