Recognizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant.

## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Only two individuals were ever permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Moses**

* God specifically commanded Moses to approach the ark and consult with it during times of crisis and decision-making (Exodus 24:1-4).

**2. The High Priest**

* In the later prophetic periods, the High Priest was permitted to approach the ark once a year on the Day of Atonement to perform sacrifices and prayers (Leviticus 16:1-3). 

**Neither the common people nor any other individual was permitted to approach the ark without incurring severe punishment.** The proximity of the ark was associated with immense power and glory, and access was strictly limited to those whom God had specifically designated.

Comment: The response accurately identifies the role of the high priest as the only individual permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant, specifically on the Day of Atonement. It acknowledges the significance of the High Priest in the Israelites' relationship with God and the covenant by highlighting the importance of the annual sacrifice and prayers conducted by the High Priest in this context. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian perspective on the exclusivity of access to the Ark and recognizes the significance of the High Priest in mediating the relationship between the people and God.
