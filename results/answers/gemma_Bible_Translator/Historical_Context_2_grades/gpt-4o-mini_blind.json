  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the significance of eating unleavened bread during the Israelites' escape from Egypt. The answer correctly highlights the symbolic nature of the unleavened bread in commemorating the haste of their departure and the liberation from slavery. However, to improve the grade, the student could have further elaborated on the deeper spiritual symbolism of leaven in the Bible, such as its association with sin and corruption, and how the removal of leaven during Passover reflects purity and redemption through Christ."
