## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a fulfillment of the symbolic sacrifices described in the Old Testament. The consumption of unleavened bread was intended to commemorate the hasty departure from Egypt and symbolized the absence of time for their bread to rise. This event is recounted in the book of Exodus (12:1-14).

The Bible teaches that God instructed the Israelites to abstain from leavened bread during the Passover celebration to commemorate the liberation from Egyptian slavery. Unleavened bread symbolizes the haste with which the Israelites fled Egypt, leaving no time for their bread to rise.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the significance of eating unleavened bread during the Israelites' escape from Egypt. The answer correctly highlights the symbolic nature of the unleavened bread in commemorating the haste of their departure and the liberation from slavery. However, to improve the grade, the student could have further elaborated on the deeper spiritual symbolism of leaven in the Bible, such as its association with sin and corruption, and how the removal of leaven during Passover reflects purity and redemption through Christ.
