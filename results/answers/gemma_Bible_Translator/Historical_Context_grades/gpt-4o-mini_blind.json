  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough overview of biblical events that illustrate the concept of \"remnant\" as seen in Isaiah and Amos. The student effectively connects these events to God's faithfulness, sovereignty, and the continuation of his covenant with a faithful people. The inclusion of relevant biblical passages enhances the answer's credibility. However, to improve, the student could further emphasize the significance of the remnant in God's redemptive plan and clarify the theological implications of the remnant in relation to salvation history."
