  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer by discussing various biblical events illustrating the concept of remnant and including relevant biblical passages. However, there is a lack of focus on the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises as specifically mentioned in the concern. The answer could have been improved by directly addressing the historical context and emphasizing the connection between God's promises and the preservation of a remnant throughout biblical events."
