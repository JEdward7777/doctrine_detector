The response effectively connects the concept of remnant to God's faithfulness to his covenant throughout history. The incorporation of both Old and New Testament examples enhances the depth of the answer. Just a minor suggestion would be to delve a bit more into the historical context of the events mentioned to further solidify the understanding of God's promises in relation to the remnant."
