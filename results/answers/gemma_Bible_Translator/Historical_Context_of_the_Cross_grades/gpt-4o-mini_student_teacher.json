  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: \nThe student provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of Roman crucifixion on early Christianity, highlighting key points such as confirming Christ's humanity, emphasizing his sacrifice, and illustrating divine power through resurrection. However, the student could improve their answer by more directly addressing the concern of the transformation of the symbol of death into one of life and hope central to the Christian message. The teacher's reference answer succinctly captures this transformation aspect, which the student's response could have emphasized more clearly."
