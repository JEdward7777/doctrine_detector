  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and well-structured approach to introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit in contexts unfamiliar with the Trinity. It correctly emphasizes the Spirit's role in salvation and sanctification, showcases the Spirit's work in believers, suggests using analogies and metaphors to aid understanding, advises on contextual adaptation, highlights the Spirit's fruit, shares personal experiences, and stresses the unity of the Trinity. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the biblical foundation for each point made. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
