However, it could be improved by incorporating more detailed explanations and examples as outlined in the suggested criteria, especially in terms of emphasizing the Spirit's role in salvation, describing the Spirit's work in believers, utilizing analogies and metaphors, focusing on the Spirit's fruit, sharing personal experiences, and emphasizing the unity of the Trinity.
