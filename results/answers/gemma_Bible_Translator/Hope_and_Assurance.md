**Biblical References:**

* "Hope deferred makes the heart sick" (Proverbs 13:12)
* "For in hope we are saved, but hope that is seen is not hope" (Romans 8:24)
* "There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1)

**Significance of Having No Hope:**

Having no hope according to biblical references suggests that:

**1. True faith rests on God's unwavering love and promises:**
- True hope is not based on our own accomplishments or future prospects.
- It is rooted in the belief that God loves us unconditionally and has a plan for our good.

**2. Hope that is seen is not true hope:**
- External or visible manifestations of hope can be deceptive.
- Genuine hope is an internal conviction that rests on God's character and promises.

**3. Freedom from condemnation:**
- In Christ Jesus, we are forgiven of our sins and declared righteous.
- There is no condemnation or judgment for those who are in Christ.

**4. Dependence on God's faithfulness:**
- Hope is built on the promise that God is faithful to his word and his promises.
- When we trust in God's faithfulness, we can be confident that he will fulfill his promises.

**5. A foundation for perseverance:**
- Without hope, it is easy to give up or despair.
- But when we have hope in God's promises, we can persevere through trials and temptations.

**Conclusion:**

The absence of hope in biblical references highlights the need for faith in God's unwavering love and promises. True hope is an internal conviction that rests on God's character and faithfulness, and it provides a foundation for freedom from condemnation, perseverance, and a life of faith.
