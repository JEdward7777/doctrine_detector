  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-structured answer discussing the various contexts in which the term 'hosts' is used in scripture, including angelic hosts, spiritual hosts, and human hosts. They support their explanations with relevant biblical passages and provide insight into the broader theological implications of the term. The inclusion of considerations for interpreting the term in Christian theology and the emphasis on key themes in biblical passages related to 'hosts' demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. Great job overall!"
