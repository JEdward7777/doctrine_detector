  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term 'hosts' in scripture, including references to angels, spiritual beings, and celestial bodies. It demonstrates a good understanding of the broad scope of the term. In relation to the concern about how understanding spiritual warfare and divine authority impacts prayer and spiritual battles, the response could have delved deeper into the practical implications for believers in terms of how this knowledge should influence their prayer life and engagement in spiritual battles. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
