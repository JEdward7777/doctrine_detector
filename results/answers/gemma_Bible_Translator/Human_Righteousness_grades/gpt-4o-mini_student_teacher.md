## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**A person is declared righteous according to the Christian faith through faith in Jesus Christ.**

The Bible teaches that human beings are sinful and fall short of God's perfect standards (Romans 3:23). However, God, in His great love for us, provided a way for us to be reconciled to Him.

**Here's how it works:**

* **Jesus Christ died on the cross as the perfect sacrifice for our sins.** His death paid the penalty for our wrongdoing.
* **He rose from the dead on the third day, demonstrating His victory over sin and death.**
* **Through faith in Jesus Christ, we are credited with His righteousness.** This means that God sees us as being clean and acceptable in His sight, because of what Jesus has done for us.

**The Bible teaches this clearly:**

* "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith – and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God – not by works so that no one can boast." (Ephesians 2:8)
* "Therefore, as believers, we are justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law." (Romans 3:26)

**To be declared righteous:**

1. Acknowledge your need for forgiveness of sin.
2. Believe in Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and Lord.
3. Repent of your sins and turn to God.
4. Receive the gift of righteousness through faith.

**Once you are declared righteous:**

* You are forgiven of your sins and have peace with God.
* You have been given new life in Christ.
* You are empowered to live a life that pleases God.

**Remember:**

* Justification is a gift from God, received by faith in Jesus Christ.
* It is not based on anything you do, but solely on what Christ has done for you.
