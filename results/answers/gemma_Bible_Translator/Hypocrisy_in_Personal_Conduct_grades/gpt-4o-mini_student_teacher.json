  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer, covering various aspects such as examining beliefs, transparency, consistency in actions, humility, ethical considerations, and prayer. However, the answer could have been more focused on the central theme of aligning actions with beliefs to avoid hypocrisy. While the provided steps are valuable, they could have been more explicitly tied back to the concept of ensuring alignment to prevent hypocrisy. The answer could have also included a stronger emphasis on personal reflection and reliance on God, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher."
