  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a solid and well-supported explanation of the concept of God calling individuals by name. The student effectively incorporates doctrinal truths related to election and redemption, supported by relevant biblical references. The emphasis on the personal nature of God's call and the significance of salvation through Jesus Christ is commendable. The response could further benefit from elaborating on the role of faith and response in accepting God's call, but overall, it is well-founded in Christian doctrine."
