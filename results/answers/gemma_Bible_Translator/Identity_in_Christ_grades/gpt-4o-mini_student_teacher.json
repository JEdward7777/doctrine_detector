  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer, delving into the concepts of election and redemption in relation to God's call to individuals. The biblical references provided also strengthen the answer. However, the student's answer could have been improved by focusing more on the personal aspect of God knowing each individual by name and the significance of that in understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ."
