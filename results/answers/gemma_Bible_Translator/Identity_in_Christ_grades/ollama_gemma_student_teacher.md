## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**When God says, 'I have called you by name,' He is referencing two key concepts:**

**1. Election:**

* God's call is a sovereign act of grace. He chooses individuals for salvation not based on their merit or works, but solely because of His love for them.
* This call is specific and personal, as God knows each individual by name and calls them specifically to Himself.

**2. Redemption:**

* God's call to each person is to be redeemed from sin and its consequences.
* He offers salvation through Jesus Christ, who died on the cross as a perfect sacrifice for our sins.
* This redemption is confirmed by God's spoken word, which is addressed to each individual who is called by name.

**Biblical References:**

* **Isaiah 43:1:** "But now, thus says the Lord: 'I am he who comforts you; I will take you by the hand and lead you in the way you should go; I will walk with you.'"
* **Jeremiah 31:3:** "I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing love."
* **John 10:27:** "My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me."

**Understanding the Significance:**

* The call of God is a profound privilege and a source of great joy.
* It reminds us that God is intimately involved in our lives and has a specific purpose for each individual.
* The call to salvation is not just an intellectual assent, but a deep and personal transformation of the heart and life.

**Conclusion:**

When God says, "I have called you by name," He is expressing His unconditional love and sovereignty in salvation. This call is both specific and redemptive, offering hope and purpose to all who respond to His voice.
