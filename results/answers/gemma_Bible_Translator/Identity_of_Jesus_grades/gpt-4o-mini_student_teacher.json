  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of Jesus's name and His role as Savior. They effectively highlighted the connection between the name 'Jesus' and its meaning in Hebrew, as well as its fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. Additionally, they accurately linked the name 'Jesus' to His divine nature as the Son of God and His redemptive mission. The student's answer aligned well with the reference answer from a Christian worldview, but included additional details that enhanced their explanation. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
