  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of the influence of the Sadducees and Pharisees on Jesus' crucifixion, highlighting key theological and historical factors. The response effectively connects the actions of the religious leaders to broader themes of compromise, selective interpretation of Scripture, and religious intolerance. The implications drawn from the events are insightful and relevant for contemporary faith. However, the response could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the selfishness and hypocrisy of the Sadducees and Pharisees, as stated in the reference answer. Incorporating this perspective more prominently would strengthen the overall argument and alignment with the Christian worldview."
