**According to the Bible, eternal life is a gift from God that is received through faith in Jesus Christ.**

**Here are the key steps to inherit eternal life:**

**1. Recognize your sinfulness:**
- All have sinned and fall short of God's glory (Romans 3:23).
- Sin separates us from God (Isaiah 59:2).

**2. Believe in Jesus Christ:**
- Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior (John 3:16).
- Belief in him involves acknowledging his deity, his sacrifice for our sins, and his resurrection from the dead (Romans 10:9-10).

**3. Repent of your sins:**
- Repentance involves turning away from sin and embracing God's forgiveness (Acts 2:38).
- It is a conscious decision to follow God's laws and live a life that pleases him.

**4. Receive the Holy Spirit:**
- The Holy Spirit is a gift from God that empowers believers (John 14:26).
- He helps us to understand the Bible, to live a Christ-like life, and to grow in our faith.

**5. Remain faithful:**
- Faith is not just a one-time event but a continuing journey (Hebrews 10:23).
- Staying faithful involves clinging to God's promises, obeying his commands, and living in accordance with his will.

**The Bible emphasizes that eternal life is a gift from God, not something that can be earned or achieved by our own merit.** It is through faith in Jesus Christ that we receive this incredible blessing.

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer citing relevant Bible verses and outlining key steps to inherit eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the answer could have explicitly referenced the specific interaction with the expert in Jewish law as cited in the teacher's reference answer. This connection would have further highlighted the importance of following Jesus' teachings in understanding the path to salvation and eternal life.
