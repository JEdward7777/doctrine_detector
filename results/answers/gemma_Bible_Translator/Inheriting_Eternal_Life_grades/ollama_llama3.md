## [Answer](../Inheriting_Eternal_Life.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**According to the Bible, eternal life is a gift from God that is received through faith in Jesus Christ.**

**Here are the key steps to inherit eternal life:**

**1. Recognize your sinfulness:**
- All have sinned and fall short of God's glory (Romans 3:23).
- Sin separates us from God (Isaiah 59:2).

**2. Believe in Jesus Christ:**
- Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior (John 3:16).
- Belief in him involves acknowledging his deity, his sacrifice for our sins, and his resurrection from the dead (Romans 10:9-10).

**3. Repent of your sins:**
- Repentance involves turning away from sin and embracing God's forgiveness (Acts 2:38).
- It is a conscious decision to follow God's laws and live a life that pleases him.

**4. Receive the Holy Spirit:**
- The Holy Spirit is a gift from God that empowers believers (John 14:26).
- He helps us to understand the Bible, to live a Christ-like life, and to grow in our faith.

**5. Remain faithful:**
- Faith is not just a one-time event but a continuing journey (Hebrews 10:23).
- Staying faithful involves clinging to God's promises, obeying his commands, and living in accordance with his will.

**The Bible emphasizes that eternal life is a gift from God, not something that can be earned or achieved by our own merit.** It is through faith in Jesus Christ that we receive this incredible blessing.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

This response thoroughly addresses the concern of clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. It provides a clear and concise outline of the steps necessary to inherit eternal life, referencing various biblical passages that support these points. The emphasis on faith in Jesus Christ as the means of receiving eternal life is also consistent with Jesus' teachings.

The only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect the response's explanation of the path to salvation back to the passage about the expert in Jewish law seeking guidance from Jesus (Matthew 19:16-22). While the question does mention "eternal life," the response could strengthen its connection to Jesus' teachings by explicitly referencing his words and actions as presented in the Bible.
