It effectively covers the steps of recognizing sinfulness, believing in Jesus Christ, repenting of sins, receiving the Holy Spirit, and remaining faithful. The emphasis on eternal life as a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ is biblically sound and relevant to the concern raised. Well-done!"
