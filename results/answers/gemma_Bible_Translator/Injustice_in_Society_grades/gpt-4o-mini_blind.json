  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment:\nThis is a well thought out and comprehensive response addressing various forms of injustice prevalent in today's world and suggesting appropriate responses for Christians to undertake. The student has correctly identified key examples of injustice from a Christian worldview perspective and has provided sound biblical principles for how Christians should respond. The inclusion of advocating for restorative justice, promoting cultural transformation, and emphasizing the importance of humility and grace are commendable. However, to enhance the grade, the response could strengthen the emphasis on the transformative power of the Gospel message in addressing injustice and further emphasize the foundational role of prayer, reliance on Scripture, and the centrality of Christ in pursuing justice."
