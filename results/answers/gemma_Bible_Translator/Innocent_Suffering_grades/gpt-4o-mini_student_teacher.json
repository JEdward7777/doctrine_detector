  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively explains the concept of \"innocent blood\" in the Bible and its implications for the value of life. They integrated relevant biblical passages and discussed key themes such as the sanctity of life, justice, accountability, compassion, and forgiveness. The response also appropriately addresses the concern of deeper discussions on justice, righteousness, and moral implications. One minor suggestion would be to directly connect the concept of innocent blood to the injustice of wrongful death as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
