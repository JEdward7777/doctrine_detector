  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized response addressing various aspects of how our responses to God can impact His will for our lives from a Christian perspective. The points made are cohesive and align well with Christian principles. However, the student's answer could be improved by directly connecting these points to how they specifically influence God's will for our lives, as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the Christian worldview in their response."
