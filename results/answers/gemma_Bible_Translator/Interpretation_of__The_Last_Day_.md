* "And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the days of the Son of man: Except that the deluge was by water, but this shall be by fire." (Luke 17:26-27)
* "Blessed and holy is he that shall endure unto the end: for when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory." (Matthew 25:34)

**Meaning:**

* **Judgment:** The "last day" is not merely an end to human history, but a time of divine judgment upon the wicked and unrepentant.
