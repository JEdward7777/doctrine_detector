  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and doctrinally sound explanation of the concept of the \"last day\" in Christian teaching, supported by relevant biblical references. The student effectively captures the significance of this event in terms of judgment, resurrection, and the ushering in of a new creation. The inclusion of different Christian perspectives adds depth to the explanation. Overall, a well-written and informative response that aligns well with Christian teachings."
