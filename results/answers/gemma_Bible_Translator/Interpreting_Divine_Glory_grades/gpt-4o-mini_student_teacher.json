  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of 'Divine Glory' in the context of worship, touching on important aspects such as glorifying God's character, acknowledging His power, reflecting His character in believers, responding to His grace, and the transformative effect of divine glory on the congregation. The biblical examples and conclusion tie the elements together effectively. However, the student's answer could be improved by aligning the definition of 'Divine Glory' more closely with the teacher's reference answer, emphasizing the magnificent and radiant nature of God revealed in His presence throughout their response."
