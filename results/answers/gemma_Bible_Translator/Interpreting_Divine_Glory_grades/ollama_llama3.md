90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response accurately captures the concept of "divine glory" as referring to God's magnificent and radiant nature, deserving of worship and adoration. The concern about recognizing God's glory in worship practices is also acknowledged, emphasizing its importance for expressing reverence and awe towards Him.

The only aspect that keeps it from being a perfect score (100) is the lack of depth and biblical support in some parts of the response. For instance, while it mentions the importance of recognizing God's glory, it does not explicitly state how this recognition can be achieved or what specific actions or attitudes are necessary for true worship.

However, the response makes up for this deficiency by providing clear and concise examples from Scripture (Psalm 29:2, 1 Peter 4:17, Revelation 4:10) that illustrate the concept of divine glory. This adds a level of authority and credibility to the response, making it more effective in conveying its message.

Overall, I would give this response a grade of 90 for its clear and accurate explanation of "divine glory" and its relevant biblical examples, with room for further development and expansion on the importance of recognizing God's glory in worship practices.
