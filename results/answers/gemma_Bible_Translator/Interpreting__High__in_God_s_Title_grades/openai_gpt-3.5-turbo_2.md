**Interpretation of 'High' in 'Most High':**

When interpreting the term "high" in the title "Most High" in the context of God's nature, we must consider the following:

**1. Theological Context:**

- The title "Most High" is found throughout Scripture and is a translation of the Hebrew term "tzedek" and the Greek term "hyperios."
- These terms convey the idea of supreme excellence, greatness, and sovereignty.

**2. Literal vs. Metaphorical:**

- The term "high" can have both literal and metaphorical meanings.
- In the context of God, it is primarily a metaphorical reference to God's transcendence and majesty.

**3. God's Transcendence:**

- God is beyond human comprehension and limitations.
- He exists in a realm that is infinitely higher than anything created by human beings.
- His glory and power extend far beyond our earthly understanding.

**4. God's Sovereignty:**

- God is the ultimate ruler and sovereign over all creation.
- His authority and dominion extend over every domain of existence.

**Therefore, when interpreting the term "high" in "Most High," we should understand it as:**

- A representation of God's supreme excellence and greatness.
- A reflection of his transcendence and sovereignty.
- A symbolic expression of God's utter dependency on nothing and his ultimate rule over all things.

**Additional Considerations:**

- The term "high" should not be interpreted literally as physical elevation or material elevation.
- The emphasis is on God's spiritual and theological transcendence.
- This title underscores the awe-inspiring and majestic nature of God.
