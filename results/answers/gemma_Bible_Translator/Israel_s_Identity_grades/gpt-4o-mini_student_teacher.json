  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the significance of the name 'Israel' in biblical context. They discussed the biblical origin, significance, biblical context, and Christian interpretation effectively. However, their answer did not directly address the specific concern of understanding the significance of biblical names and their meanings, as the reference answer focused on the meaning 'He struggles with God.' Hence, there is room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with the concern provided."
