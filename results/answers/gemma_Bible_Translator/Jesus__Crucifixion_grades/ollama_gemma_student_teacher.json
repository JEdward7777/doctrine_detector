  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the available information. While they acknowledge the lack of explicit biblical evidence regarding the significance of the wine and myrrh, they suggest possible interpretations. They also rightly emphasize the importance of relying on literal text and theological consensus for reliable guidance. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the symbolic or spiritual significance of the offer, considering the Christian worldview."
