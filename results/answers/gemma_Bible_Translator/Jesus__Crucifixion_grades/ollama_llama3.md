# Question [Jesus’ Crucifixion](../../../questions/Jesus__Crucifixion.md)
What does the offer of wine mixed with myrrh indicate about Jesus' experience on the cross?

# Correct Answer
The offer of wine mixed with myrrh was meant to ease Jesus' pain and suffering, yet he refused it, reflecting his full acceptance of his sacrificial role.

# Stated Concern
Reflecting on Jesus' refusal can lead to deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The offer of wine mixed with myrrh is not explicitly addressed in the Bible, and there is no consensus among scholars regarding its significance. Some interpretations suggest it may have been a traditional remedy to alleviate pain, while others propose it may symbolize the mixing of physical and spiritual healing in Jesus' sacrifice. However, it is important to rely on the literal text of Scripture and interpretations supported by theological consensus for reliable guidance on Christian theological truth.</end_of_turn>

I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response does not directly address the concern about reflecting on Jesus' refusal, but it does indirectly relate to it by mentioning Jesus' acceptance of his sacrificial role. The main issue with the response is that it primarily focuses on the wine and myrrh, without explicitly connecting it to Jesus' suffering or commitment to his mission.

The strength of this response lies in its acknowledgment of the lack of explicit biblical guidance and its emphasis on relying on theological consensus for Christian truth. However, it could be improved by more directly addressing the concern and exploring the deeper implications of Jesus' refusal.

To reach a higher grade, the response could have engaged more deeply with the concern and explored how Jesus' refusal of the wine mixed with myrrh reflects his commitment to his mission and ultimate sacrifice.
