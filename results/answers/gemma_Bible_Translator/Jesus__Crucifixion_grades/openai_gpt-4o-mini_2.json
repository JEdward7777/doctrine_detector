The concern about reflecting on Jesus' refusal leading to deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission is integrated effectively into the response. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the importance of Jesus' sacrifice for Christian salvation, emphasizing the theological significance from a Christian worldview."
