**Jesus' statement, "I am the Resurrection and the Life," reveals two key aspects of his divine nature:**

**1. The Resurrection:**

* This refers to Jesus' physical resurrection from the dead after his crucifixion.
* His resurrection demonstrates God's power over death and offers eternal life to all who believe in him.
* The resurrection validates Jesus' claim to be the Son of God and the promised Messiah.

**2. The Life:**

* This speaks to Jesus being the source of eternal life for all who believe in him.
* He offers spiritual life to the soul, which transcends physical death.
* Jesus is the fulfillment of God's promise of life abundant (John 10:10).

**Biblical references supporting this statement:**

* **John 11:25:** "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live."
* **Revelation 20:6:** "Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power."

**Theological interpretation:**

* Jesus' resurrection and life-giving power are central to Christianity.
* His sacrifice and resurrection offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to all who believe in him.
* He is the ultimate expression of God's love and grace.

**In summary, Jesus' statement "I am the Resurrection and the Life" means that he is the source of both physical resurrection and spiritual life for all who believe in him.**
