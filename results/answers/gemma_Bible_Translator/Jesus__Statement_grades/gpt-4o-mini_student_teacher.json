  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of Jesus' statement, \"I am the Resurrection and the Life,\" within a Christian worldview. They effectively explain the dual nature of Jesus as the source of physical resurrection and eternal life, supported by relevant biblical references. The theological interpretation provided is clear and aligns well with Christian beliefs. However, the student could further enhance their answer by explicitly emphasizing Jesus as the sole source of resurrection and life through his divinity, mirroring the reference answer more closely."
