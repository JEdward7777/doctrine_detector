The response also provides supporting biblical references and a theological interpretation that reinforces Jesus' role as the source of both physical resurrection and spiritual life for all who believe in him.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement. While the response does clarify Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, it could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation. For example, it would have been helpful to explore the implications of Jesus' statement on his divinity and humanity, as well as the significance of His sacrifice and resurrection in the broader context of Christian theology. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the passage and provides a clear and concise summary of Jesus' role in resurrection."
