  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" by delving into the dual aspects of his divine nature as the source of physical resurrection and eternal life. The biblical references and theological interpretation support a Christian worldview well. The response could have further emphasized Jesus' unique role as the Son of God and the Messiah to strengthen the theological understanding. Overall, it effectively addresses the concern by clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection within a Christian perspective."
