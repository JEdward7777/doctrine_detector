30.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: The student's response is inaccurate from a Christian perspective. In the Bible, Jesus frequently used the word "amen" to emphasize the truth and importance of His teachings. It is used as a strong affirmation and certainty in the statements He made. This response seems to lack knowledge of the biblical context and teachings regarding the use of "amen" by Jesus. More understanding and research on this topic is needed.
