## Question [Jesus' Teachings](../../../questions/Jesus__Teachings.md)
How did Jesus use the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings?

## Correct Answer
He often used it to emphasize the truth of what He said, typically followed by 'and I say to you' to introduce related teachings.

Recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)

40.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student correctly challenges the accuracy of the question, but they fail to provide a Christian worldview perspective on recognizing the authority of Jesus' teachings in Scripture. They missed the opportunity to acknowledge how Jesus, as the Son of God, spoke with divine authority, and how His use of "amen" affirmed the truth and significance of His teachings.
