## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** While the student correctly points out that there is no evidence to suggest Jesus used the term "amen" in the way suggested by the question, they did not engage with the broader concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. The response could have elaborated on how Jesus' use of "amen" emphasized the significance and authority of his teachings within the context of Scripture.
