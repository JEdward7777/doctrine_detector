  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture by correcting a potentially inaccurate premise. The initial statement acknowledges that the original premise may not be accurate, which demonstrates an understanding of the importance of biblical accuracy. Additionally, the response provides a clear and concise alternative explanation of Jesus' use of the term \"amen,\" highlighting its role in emphasizing the truth of His teachings. The only aspect that prevents this response from receiving a perfect score is the lack of explicit acknowledgment of Jesus' authority as the source of His teachings."
