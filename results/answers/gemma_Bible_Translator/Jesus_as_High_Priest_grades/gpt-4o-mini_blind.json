The biblical references are utilized effectively to support the points made. The student effectively communicates the implications of Jesus' priesthood for human sacrifices and provides a clear conclusion. One area for improvement could be to include a brief mention of the concept of atonement and how Jesus' sacrifice differs from the Old Testament sacrificial system, to further enhance the understanding of the significance of Christ's priesthood."
