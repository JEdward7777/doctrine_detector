  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thorough explanation of Jesus' role in the priesthood, using relevant biblical references to support their points. They effectively conveyed the significance of Jesus as the ultimate and perfect priest, rendering the sacrifices made by human priests redundant. The only area for improvement could be to include a more concise and direct response to the question without unnecessary elaboration."
