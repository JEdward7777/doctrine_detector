## Question [Jesus as High Priest](../../../questions/Jesus_as_High_Priest.md)
How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

## Correct Answer
Jesus is referred to as our 'great high priest' who intercedes for us in God's presence and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, meaning that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.

## Jesus and the Priesthood

In Christianity, Jesus Christ fulfills the ultimate priesthood, as the writer of Hebrews states:

**"He is able to save forever those who draw near to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them." (Hebrews 7:25)**

This means that Jesus himself is our mediator and priest before God. His sacrifice on the cross covers the sins of all who believe in him, and his ongoing intercession ensures forgiveness and access to God. 

Therefore, the sacrifices made by human priests become redundant and unnecessary. Their function is fulfilled in Christ, who offers himself as the ultimate and perfect sacrifice for sin.

**Biblical references supporting this:**

* **Hebrews 8:1-2:** "But Jesus has been appointed by God as a high priest forever, by a decree that cannot be revoked. Therefore, he is able to save forever those who draw near to God through him."
* **1 Timothy 2:5:** "There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."
* **Colossians 1:18:** "He is the head of the Church, his body, of which he is the Savior, by the power of his resurrection from the dead."

**Implications:**

* The traditional priesthood as practiced in some Christian denominations is not necessary for salvation.
* The focus of Christian worship should be on celebrating and experiencing the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
* Believers are called to approach God directly through Christ, who intercedes for them and offers forgiveness for sins.

**Conclusion:**

Jesus Christ is the ultimate and perfect priest, and his sacrifice is the only sacrifice that can cover the sins of humanity. The sacrifices of human priests are obsolete in light of Christ's sacrifice.

95.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

The response provides a clear and concise explanation of Jesus' role as our great high priest, interceding for us in God's presence and offering himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. The text quotes relevant biblical passages that support Jesus' fulfillment of the priesthood, including Hebrews 7:25, which is specifically mentioned in the concern.

The response also effectively highlights the implications of Jesus' priesthood, including the obsolescence of human priestly sacrifices and the direct access to God through Christ's intercession. The conclusion reiterates the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and its superiority over human priestly offerings.

One area for improvement could be a more explicit connection between Jesus' role in the priesthood and his teachings or actions throughout the Gospels, as this would further solidify the significance of his priesthood in Christian understanding.
