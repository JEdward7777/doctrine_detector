## Jesus and the Priesthood

In Christianity, Jesus Christ fulfills the ultimate priesthood, as the writer of Hebrews states:

**"He is able to save forever those who draw near to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them." (Hebrews 7:25)**

This means that Jesus himself is our mediator and priest before God. His sacrifice on the cross covers the sins of all who believe in him, and his ongoing intercession ensures forgiveness and access to God. 

Therefore, the sacrifices made by human priests become redundant and unnecessary. Their function is fulfilled in Christ, who offers himself as the ultimate and perfect sacrifice for sin.

**Biblical references supporting this:**

* **Hebrews 8:1-2:** "But Jesus has been appointed by God as a high priest forever, by a decree that cannot be revoked. Therefore, he is able to save forever those who draw near to God through him."
* **1 Timothy 2:5:** "There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."
* **Colossians 1:18:** "He is the head of the Church, his body, of which he is the Savior, by the power of his resurrection from the dead."

**Implications:**

* The traditional priesthood as practiced in some Christian denominations is not necessary for salvation.
* The focus of Christian worship should be on celebrating and experiencing the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
* Believers are called to approach God directly through Christ, who intercedes for them and offers forgiveness for sins.

**Conclusion:**

Jesus Christ is the ultimate and perfect priest, and his sacrifice is the only sacrifice that can cover the sins of humanity. The sacrifices of human priests are obsolete in light of Christ's sacrifice.
