The supporting New Testament passages are relevant and well-interpreted, highlighting Jesus' unique and unparalleled priesthood. The explanation of Jesus' role as both the Great Priest and the Great King is clear and aligns with Christian doctrine. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological significance of Jesus as the ultimate High Priest. Great job!"
