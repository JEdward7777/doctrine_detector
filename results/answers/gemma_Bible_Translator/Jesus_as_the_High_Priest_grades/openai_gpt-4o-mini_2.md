## [Answer](../Jesus_as_the_High_Priest.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Jesus Christ fulfills the role of the ultimate High Priest in the New Testament.** While the Old Testament sacrifices and priesthood foreshadowed Christ's ministry, they were temporary and inadequate.

**New Testament passages that support this claim:**

* **Hebrews 4:14:** "Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that through his death he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God."
* **Hebrews 7:25:** "He is able to save completely those who approach God through him because he always lives and intercedes for them."
* **1 Peter 3:22:** "He is the head of the Church, the Church being his body, of which he is the Savior."

**Jesus' priesthood is unique and unparalleled:**

* He is the only perfect and sinless High Priest.
* His sacrifice is perfect and complete, once for all.
* He intercedes for believers before the Father.
* He is the ultimate Mediator between God and man.

**Therefore, Jesus fulfills the role of both the Great Priest and the Great King, offering salvation and redemption to all who come to him.**
