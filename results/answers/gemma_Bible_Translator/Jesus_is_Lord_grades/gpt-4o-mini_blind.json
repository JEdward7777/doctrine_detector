  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 90.\n\nThe answer provides a clear and doctrinally sound explanation on how to communicate the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also referred to as 'lord.' The student effectively emphasizes the unique lordship of Jesus and provides suggestions on contextualizing the phrase, using distinctive language, providing scriptural references, and being sensitive to the context.\n\nThe only room for improvement would be to perhaps provide a bit more depth in the explanation of scriptural references and how they specifically support the claim of Jesus' lordship over all creation and authority figures. Additionally, reinforcing the idea of submission and obedience to earthly authorities within the context of ultimate allegiance to Christ could strengthen the answer.\n\nOverall, the answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of communicating the concept of \"Jesus is Lord\" effectively within the given context."
