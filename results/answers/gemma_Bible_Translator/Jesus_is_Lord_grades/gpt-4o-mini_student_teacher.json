  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer that effectively addresses the concern of differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. They have emphasized the unique lordship of Jesus, contextualized the phrase, used distinctive language, and provided scriptural references. However, the student could improve their answer by directly incorporating the teacher's suggested explanation of 'Jesus is Lord' signifying His divine authority and supremacy."
