  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concern regarding clarity and distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The response provides a comprehensive and well-reasoned explanation of how the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" can be communicated in a context where political leaders are also called \"lord.\" The student's use of biblical references, contextualization, and distinctive language reinforces the clarity and Christian-specific worldview of the response."
