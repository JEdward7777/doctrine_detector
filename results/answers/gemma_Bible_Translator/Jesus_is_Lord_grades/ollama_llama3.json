  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of emphasizing Jesus' divine authority and supremacy over all creation, which addresses the concern about clarity in differentiating between Jesus' lordship and earthly titles. However, it could be improved by providing more specific examples or biblical references to support its claim. Additionally, while it touches on the idea that Jesus' lordship is distinct from human rulers, it could be further developed to highlight the unique nature of Jesus' reign.\n\nThe response receives high marks for its clear and concise language, which effectively conveys the message that \"Jesus is Lord\" signifies His divine authority and supremacy. However, it falls short of perfection by not fully addressing the concern about differentiating between Jesus' lordship and earthly titles."
