# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**1. Emphasize the Unique Lordship of Jesus:**

* "Jesus is Lord" should be understood as referring to his exclusive lordship over all creation, including human authority figures.
* Use language that highlights the uniqueness of Jesus' lordship, emphasizing his divine authority and sovereignty.


**2. Contextualize the Phrase:**

* Explain that the phrase "Jesus is Lord" is not intended to undermine or contradict the authority of political leaders.
* Make it clear that Christians respect and obey lawful authority figures, while ultimately submitting only to the Lord Jesus Christ.


**3. Use Distinctive Language:**

* Choose words that convey the spiritual and divine nature of Jesus' lordship without equating it with earthly authority.
* For example, "Jesus reigns supreme," "Jesus is the ultimate authority," or "Jesus holds sovereignty over all things."


**4. Provide Scriptural References:**

* Support the claim with biblical passages that emphasize Jesus' lordship, such as Philippians 2:10-11, Romans 14:10, and Colossians 1:18.


**5. Be Sensitive to Context:**

* Consider the cultural and political sensitivities of the audience when communicating the phrase.
* Avoid language that could be interpreted as disrespectful or contentious.


**Sample Responses:**

* "Jesus is Lord over all creation, including the authorities who govern us. We respect and obey them, but ultimately our ultimate allegiance is to Christ."
* "The lordship of Jesus Christ is supreme and universal. This means he has authority over every area of life, including the political sphere."
* "Jesus is the Lord and King of Kings, ruling over the heavens and the earth. His authority extends over every authority figure, for they are created in his image."

I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response does a good job of emphasizing Jesus' divine authority and supremacy over all creation, which addresses the concern about clarity in differentiating between Jesus' lordship and earthly titles. However, it could be improved by providing more specific examples or biblical references to support its claim. Additionally, while it touches on the idea that Jesus' lordship is distinct from human rulers, it could be further developed to highlight the unique nature of Jesus' reign.

The response receives high marks for its clear and concise language, which effectively conveys the message that "Jesus is Lord" signifies His divine authority and supremacy. However, it falls short of perfection by not fully addressing the concern about differentiating between Jesus' lordship and earthly titles.
