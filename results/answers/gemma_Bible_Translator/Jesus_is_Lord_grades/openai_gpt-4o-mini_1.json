It clearly distinguishes between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles, using language that conveys the spiritual and divine nature of his authority. The biblical references provided further support the explanation. However, including more specific examples or illustrations could enhance the clarity and depth of the response even further. Overall, this is a well-written and informative explanation from a Christian worldview perspective."
