# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**1. Emphasize the Unique Lordship of Jesus:**

* Explain that the phrase "Jesus is Lord" is not intended to undermine or contradict the authority of political leaders.
* Make it clear that Christians respect and obey lawful authority figures, while ultimately submitting only to the Lord Jesus Christ.
