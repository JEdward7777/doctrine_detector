  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively emphasizes Jesus' divine authority and supremacy over all creation, as requested. It clearly distinguishes between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles, addressing the concern provided. However, the response could benefit from incorporating some of the additional elements suggested in the grading criteria, such as contextualizing the phrase, using distinctive language, providing scriptural references, and being sensitive to the audience's context. Overall, a solid and clear response with room for further enhancement."
