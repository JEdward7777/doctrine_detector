## [Answer](../Jesus_is_Lord.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**1. Emphasize the Unique Lordship of Jesus:**

* "Jesus is Lord" should be understood as referring to his exclusive lordship over all creation, including human authority figures.
* Use language that highlights the uniqueness of Jesus' lordship, emphasizing his divine authority and sovereignty.


**2. Contextualize the Phrase:**

* Explain that the phrase "Jesus is Lord" is not intended to undermine or contradict the authority of political leaders.
* Make it clear that Christians respect and obey lawful authority figures, while ultimately submitting only to the Lord Jesus Christ.


**3. Use Distinctive Language:**

* Choose words that convey the spiritual and divine nature of Jesus' lordship without equating it with earthly authority.
* For example, "Jesus reigns supreme," "Jesus is the ultimate authority," or "Jesus holds sovereignty over all things."


**4. Provide Scriptural References:**

* Support the claim with biblical passages that emphasize Jesus' lordship, such as Philippians 2:10-11, Romans 14:10, and Colossians 1:18.


**5. Be Sensitive to Context:**

* Consider the cultural and political sensitivities of the audience when communicating the phrase.
* Avoid language that could be interpreted as disrespectful or contentious.


**Sample Responses:**

* "Jesus is Lord over all creation, including the authorities who govern us. We respect and obey them, but ultimately our ultimate allegiance is to Christ."
* "The lordship of Jesus Christ is supreme and universal. This means he has authority over every area of life, including the political sphere."
* "Jesus is the Lord and King of Kings, ruling over the heavens and the earth. His authority extends over every authority figure, for they are created in his image."
