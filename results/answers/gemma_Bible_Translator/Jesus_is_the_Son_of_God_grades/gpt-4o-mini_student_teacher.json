  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has shown effort in carefully considering how to translate the phrase \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context while minimizing offense and maintaining theological accuracy. They have provided thoughtful suggestions and strategies for contextualization within Islamic beliefs. However, there is room for improvement in aligning the translation more closely with the reference answer, which emphasizes maintaining the original terminology while providing clear teaching and context. The student should focus on ensuring that the translated text maintains the biblical truth inherent in the original phrase."
