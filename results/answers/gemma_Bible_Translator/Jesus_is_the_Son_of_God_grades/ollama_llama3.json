However, it does not fully consider the nuances of Islamic beliefs and values, which are crucial in this context.\n\nThe suggested translation, \"Translate 'Jesus is the Son of God' by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning,\" lacks creativity and sensitivity towards Islamic beliefs. It does not attempt to find parallels or contextualize the concept of divine sonship within Islamic theology.\n\nWhile the concern about minimizing offense is important, it is equally crucial to engage with Islamic beliefs and values in a respectful and understanding manner. The provided response does not demonstrate this level of engagement and respect."
