It appropriately emphasizes maintaining the original terminology while also ensuring clear teaching and contextual explanation. The suggestions for focusing on divine sonship, contextualizing with Islamic beliefs, and seeking understanding and respect are commendable. The overall approach aligns well with the concern raised, prioritizing Biblical accuracy while being sensitive to Islamic beliefs. The response could have included a bit more emphasis on the unique divinity of Jesus as the Son of God within Christian theology."
