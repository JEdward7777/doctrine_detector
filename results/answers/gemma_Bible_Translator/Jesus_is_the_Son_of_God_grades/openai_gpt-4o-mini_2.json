  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and sensitive approach to translating the statement while considering the concern of maintaining Biblical accuracy and explaining the original text's meaning appropriately. The focus on contextualizing within Islamic beliefs, maintaining the essence of the statement, and seeking understanding and respect are commendable. The suggested translations reflect an effort to convey the message in a culturally relevant way. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on emphasizing Jesus' unique and divine relationship with God, aligning with Christian theology. Overall, this response demonstrates a good balance between sensitivity and faithfulness to the original text."
