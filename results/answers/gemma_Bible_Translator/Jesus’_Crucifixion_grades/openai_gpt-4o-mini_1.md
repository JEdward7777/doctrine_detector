# Question [Jesus’ Crucifixion](../../../questions/Jesus’_Crucifixion.md)
What does the offer of wine mixed with myrrh indicate about Jesus' experience on the cross?

# Correct Answer
The offer of wine mixed with myrrh was meant to ease Jesus' pain and suffering, yet he refused it, reflecting his full acceptance of his sacrificial role.

# Stated Concern
Reflecting on Jesus' refusal can lead to deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The offer of wine mixed with myrrh is not explicitly addressed in the Bible, and there is no consensus among scholars regarding its significance. Some interpretations suggest it may have been a traditional remedy to alleviate pain, while others propose it may symbolize the mixing of physical and spiritual healing in Jesus' sacrifice. However, it is important to rely on the literal text of Scripture and interpretations supported by theological consensus for reliable guidance on Christian theological truth.</end_of_turn>

I would grade this response as 70.

While the response acknowledges the significance of Jesus' refusal of the wine mixed with myrrh in relation to his sacrificial role, it falls short in fully exploring the deeper insights that can be gained from reflecting on this event. By delving further into the implications of Jesus' refusal for his suffering and commitment to his mission, the response could have provided a richer and more comprehensive analysis from a Christian worldview.
