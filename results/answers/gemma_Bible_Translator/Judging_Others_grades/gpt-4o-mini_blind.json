The references to relevant verses support the points made, emphasizing the importance of having the right heart, showing compassion, examining motives, avoiding harmful judgments, and seeking reconciliation. The student has effectively captured the core principles outlined in the Bible regarding how Christians should judge one another. The only area for improvement could be to emphasize the sovereign grace of God in judgment and forgiveness, which could elevate the understanding of judgment within a Christian worldview. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound response."
