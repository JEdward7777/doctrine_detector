  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical instructions regarding judging others within the Christian community, focusing on having a right heart, compassion, understanding, examining motives, avoiding harmful judgments, and seeking reconciliation. The principles highlighted are aligned with Christian teachings. However, the student could have focused more on the core biblical principle of not judging others harshly or condemning them, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a well-rounded understanding of how to approach relationships within the Christian community was demonstrated."
