The student effectively references relevant Bible verses to support their points and presents a balanced view of judgment as both serious and hopeful. One area for potential improvement could be to delve deeper into the concept of grace and the finished work of Christ in relation to judgment. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound interpretation."
