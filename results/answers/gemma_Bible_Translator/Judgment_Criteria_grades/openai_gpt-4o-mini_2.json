The integration of relevant Bible verses strengthens the argument presented, and the inclusion of criteria, process, consequences, and comfort related to judgment demonstrates a well-rounded understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The conclusion effectively ties together the key points discussed. Great job in addressing the question with depth and relevance to Christian beliefs."
