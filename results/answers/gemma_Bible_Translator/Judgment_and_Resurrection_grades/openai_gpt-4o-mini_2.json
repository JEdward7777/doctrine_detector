It addresses the concern by elaborating on the inauguration of God's Kingdom, God's judgment and wrath, Christ's return and ascension, new creation, and God's glorification, supported by relevant Biblical references. The only minor suggestion would be to further emphasize the importance of repentance and redemption for sinners during this time of judgment."
