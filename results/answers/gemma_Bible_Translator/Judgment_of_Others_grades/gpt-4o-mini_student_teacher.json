They included relevant Bible verses and emphasized key principles such as self-examination, humility, love, forgiveness, and reconciliation. The inclusion of practical advice on communication and motive evaluation further enhances the depth of their response. While the reference answer provided by the teacher focuses on a specific Bible verse, the student's answer expands on this core teaching effectively, making it a strong and insightful response."
