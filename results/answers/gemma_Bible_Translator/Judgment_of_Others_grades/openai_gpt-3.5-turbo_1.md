## Question [Judgment of Others](../../../questions/Judgment_of_Others.md)
What does Jesus teach us about pointing out the faults of others in relation to our own faults?

## Correct Answer
Jesus teaches us to first remove the plank from our own eye before pointing out the speck in someone else's eye, reminding us to practice humility and self-reflection (Luke 6:41-42).

## Stated Concern
Criticizing others while ignoring our own faults can reflect hypocrisy and diminish our witness as Christians.

## [Answer](../Judgment_of_Others.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
## Jesus' teachings on pointing out the faults of others:

**1. Practice self-examination:**

* "Judge not, that you be not judged" (Matthew 7:1) 
* "Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith" (2 Corinthians 13:5)

**2. Focus on your own sin first:**

* "First remove the plank from your own eye, then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye" (Matthew 7:3-5)
* "Forgive others, as you also have been forgiven" (Colossians 3:13)

**3. Communicate with love and humility:**

* "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger" (Proverbs 15:1)
* "If someone sins against you, go and tell them their fault between you and them alone" (Matthew 18:15)

**4. Be mindful of motive:**

* "Why do you call someone a hypocrite when you yourself are just as bad?" (Matthew 7:3)
* "Do not judge, that you be not judged" (Luke 6:37)

**5. Seek reconciliation:**

* "Therefore, if you are offering a gift, and you are aware that it contains even a tiny bit of pride, do not offer it" (Matthew 6:2)
* "Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:3)

**Key principles to remember:**

* Judging others can be harmful and counterproductive. 
* True Christian living involves personal humility and self-examination. 
* Open and honest communication, coupled with love and forgiveness, is essential for building healthy relationships.

Grade: 95

Comment: This response effectively applies Jesus' teaching to the concern by emphasizing the importance of personal humility and self-reflection before correcting others. The addition of relevant Bible verses and explanations further strengthens the Christian perspective. The only room for improvement would be to include a more direct connection to the concern raised, perhaps by explicitly addressing how ignoring our own faults can lead to hypocrisy and affect our witness as Christians.
