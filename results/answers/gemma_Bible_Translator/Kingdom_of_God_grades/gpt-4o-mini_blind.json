  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-reasoned argument for rephrasing \"Kingdom of God\" in translations for cultures without a concept of kingdoms. The reasons given, such as considering cultural context, communicative effectiveness, and theological emphasis, are valid and align with Christian principles. The suggested alternatives are thoughtful and maintain the spiritual essence of the original term. The considerations and conclusion tie the points together effectively. Overall, this is a strong and doctrinally sound argument."
