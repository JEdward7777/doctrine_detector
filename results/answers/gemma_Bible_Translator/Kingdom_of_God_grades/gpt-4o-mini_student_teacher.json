  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student has provided well-reasoned arguments and alternatives for rephrasing 'Kingdom of God' in translations for cultures without a concept of kingdoms. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the reference answer from the teacher, which advocates for retaining 'Kingdom of God' and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance, aligns better with the concern that rephrasing could lose the depth and biblical context of the term. The student's answer is thoughtful and considers cultural context, communicative effectiveness, and theological emphasis, but ultimately falls short of fully respecting the depth and importance of 'Kingdom of God' in its original form."
