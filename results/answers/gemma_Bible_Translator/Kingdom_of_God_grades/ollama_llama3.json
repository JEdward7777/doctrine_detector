  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response acknowledges the concern about losing depth and biblical context by providing explanations about the spiritual and eschatological significance of \"Kingdom of God\". However, it does not fully address the issue, as it only suggests providing explanations without exploring alternative translations that could better convey the concept to non-Western audiences.\n\nThe strength of this response lies in its recognition of the cultural and communicative challenges involved in translating the Kingdom of God. It also offers some potential alternatives for consideration, which demonstrates an understanding of the need to adapt the biblical text to different contexts.\n\nTo improve, I would suggest adding more specific examples or analysis on how rephrasing \"Kingdom of God\" could actually enhance the depth and biblical context, rather than merely providing explanations that might not be sufficient to overcome cultural barriers."
