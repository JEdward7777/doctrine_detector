# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**It is advisable to rephrase 'Kingdom of God' in translations for cultures with no concept of kingdoms.**

**Reasons:**

* **Cultural context:** The concept of a kingdom is deeply rooted in Western cultural and historical understanding. Cultures without a concept of kingdoms may not readily grasp the significance of this term.
* **Communicative effectiveness:** Translating the concept of the Kingdom of God literally may not effectively convey its spiritual and transformative message to non-Western audiences.
* **Theological emphasis:** The Kingdom of God is primarily a spiritual reality, not a political or territorial one. The emphasis should be on its heavenly nature and its impact on the hearts and lives of people.

**Possible alternatives:**

* **Reign of God:** Focuses on God's sovereign authority and rule in the lives of believers.
* **Kingdom of righteousness:** Emphasizes the restoration of justice and righteousness.
* **New creation:** Highlights the transformative power of God's love in creating a new and renewed world.
* **Sphere of influence:** Indicates the impact of God's principles and values in society.

**Considerations:**

* The specific alternative chosen should be clear and understandable in the target culture.
* The translation should accurately convey the spiritual and transformative nature of the Kingdom of God.
* It is important to maintain the integrity of the biblical text while also adapting it to different cultural contexts.

**Conclusion:**

Rephrasing 'Kingdom of God' is an advisable practice in translations for cultures with no concept of kingdoms. By selecting appropriate alternatives, translators can effectively communicate the spiritual essence of this important theological concept to a wider audience.

I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response acknowledges the concern about losing depth and biblical context by providing explanations about the spiritual and eschatological significance of "Kingdom of God". However, it does not fully address the issue, as it only suggests providing explanations without exploring alternative translations that could better convey the concept to non-Western audiences.

The strength of this response lies in its recognition of the cultural and communicative challenges involved in translating the Kingdom of God. It also offers some potential alternatives for consideration, which demonstrates an understanding of the need to adapt the biblical text to different contexts.

To improve, I would suggest adding more specific examples or analysis on how rephrasing "Kingdom of God" could actually enhance the depth and biblical context, rather than merely providing explanations that might not be sufficient to overcome cultural barriers.
