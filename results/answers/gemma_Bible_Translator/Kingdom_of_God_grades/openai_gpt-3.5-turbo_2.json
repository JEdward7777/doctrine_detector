  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides well-thought-out reasons, alternatives, and considerations for rephrasing 'Kingdom of God' in translations for cultures without the concept of kingdoms. However, it effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of retaining and explaining the term's biblical and eschatological significance. The response offers a balanced perspective, showing sensitivity to cultural differences while also upholding the depth of the biblical concept."
