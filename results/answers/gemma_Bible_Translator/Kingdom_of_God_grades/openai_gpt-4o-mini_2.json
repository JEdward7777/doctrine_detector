  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned argument for rephrasing 'Kingdom of God' in translations for cultures without a concept of kingdoms. The suggested alternatives are thoughtful and relevant to convey the spiritual essence effectively. However, the concern that rephrasing could lose the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' is valid and should be addressed further in the response. Overall, good insight and considerations are provided, but more emphasis on retaining the biblical and eschatological significance of the term would strengthen the argument."
