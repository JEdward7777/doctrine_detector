While it does not explicitly connect this concept to the intended message of the biblical authors, it provides a sound biblical and theological basis for retaining the term \"heaven\".\n\nThe response also demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant Greek terminology (\"ouranos\") and its literal translation as \"heaven\". It effectively argues that using \"paradise\" or \"transmigration\" would alter the original meaning and mislead readers.\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is in explicitly connecting the concept of \"heaven\" to the intended message of the biblical authors. A more direct link between the unique terminology and the author's intention could strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of biblical language and theology, and provides a compelling case for retaining the term \"heaven\" in Matthew's gospel."
