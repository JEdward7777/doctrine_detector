**Preserving the Literal Meaning:**

* The term "heaven" in the phrase "kingdom of heaven" is a literal translation of the Greek word "ouranos," which refers to the celestial realm or abode of the divine.
* Translating it to a non-literal term like "paradise" or "transmigration" would alter the original meaning and mislead readers.

**Supporting Biblical Theology:**

* Throughout the Bible, "heaven" is used as a symbolic representation of God's dwelling place and the ultimate destiny of believers.
* The "kingdom of heaven" is a present reality that will ultimately culminate in the future resurrection and glorification of believers in the literal heaven.

**Preserving Continuity with Tradition:**

* The use of "heaven" in this phrase has been consistent with Christian tradition for centuries.
* Changing it would disrupt the continuity of interpretation and could lead to confusion among readers.

**Explanatory Power:**

* The term "heaven" evokes a sense of awe and transcendence that is appropriate for describing God's kingdom.
* It reminds believers that the kingdom is a realm beyond human comprehension and experience.

**Clarity for Readers:**

* Using "heaven" clarifies the meaning of the phrase for readers who are familiar with the Christian lexicon.
* It is a widely understood term that requires no additional explanation.

**Conclusion:**

The retention of the term "heaven" in the phrase "kingdom of heaven" is essential for preserving the literal meaning, supporting biblical theology, maintaining continuity with tradition, and providing explanatory power to readers.
