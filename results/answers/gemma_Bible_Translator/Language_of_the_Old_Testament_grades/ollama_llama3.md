Comment: The response provides accurate information that confirms the biblical account, citing modern archaeological and linguistic evidence to support the statement. While it's not explicitly stated why this knowledge is essential for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context, the mention of such evidence implies an awareness of the importance of understanding the original language in which the Old Testament was written. A minor deduction is made due to the lack of explicit connection between the evidence and its relevance to understanding the Scripture's original context.

Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of knowing the original language of the Old Testament and provides supporting evidence, making it an excellent attempt at answering the question!
