  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-structured overview of how believers in various cities typically met in the early church, covering typical practices, factors influencing meeting practices, examples from specific cities, and underlying principles. The answer is informative and draws connections to biblical accounts. However, to enhance the response, additional references to specific biblical passages could be included for each point made regarding typical practices and underlying principles. Emphasizing the scriptural basis for each assertion would strengthen the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
