  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of early church gathering practices in various cities, citing relevant biblical examples and underlying principles. However, the response did not directly address the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers as emphasized in the reference answer. While the student's answer is informative and well-structured, it lacks a specific focus on the importance of fostering close-knit relationships and community among believers in a specific city. A stronger connection to the concern would have improved the grade in this context."
