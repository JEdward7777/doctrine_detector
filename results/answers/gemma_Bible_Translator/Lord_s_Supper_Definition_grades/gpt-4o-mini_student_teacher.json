  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a solid, well-articulated explanation of the meaning and significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith. Their answer correctly reflects key aspects such as the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the symbolism of the bread and wine, and the act of remembrance. While the reference answer specifies the Passover meal, both the student's response and the reference align well within a Christian worldview, with the student expanding on the broader theological implications of the Lord's Supper."
