## [Answer](../Lord_s_Supper_Definition.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The Lord's Supper commemorates the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.**

The New Testament reveals that Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper during his final meal with his disciples. He shared bread and wine, symbolizing his body and blood, which would be offered as a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.

The event is significant because:

* **It symbolizes Christ's redemption:** The bread and wine represent Christ's body and blood, which are offered as a sacrifice for the sins of the world.
* **It is an act of remembrance:** The Lord's Supper is a reminder of Christ's sacrifice and resurrection, which is central to Christian faith and hope.
* **It is a symbol of unity:** The sharing of the Lord's Supper unites believers in remembrance of Christ and strengthens their fellowship.
