**1. Forgiveness aligns with God's love:**

* Christ demonstrated unconditional love by forgiving sinners, even while he himself was sinless.

**4. Forgiveness is essential for personal peace:**

* Holding onto anger and resentment can burden our hearts.
* Forgiveness releases us from the pain of the past and allows us to move forward in love.

**5. Forgiveness is a command of God:**

* Jesus commanded his followers to forgive others (Matthew 6:14, 18:35).
* This command is not merely a suggestion but an essential part of following Christ's teachings.

**Biblical Examples of Forgiveness:**

* Jesus forgave the thief on the cross (Luke 23:32-34).
* Paul forgave those who persecuted him (Colossians 3:13).

Grade: 90

Comment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported explanation of why forgiveness is a critical aspect of loving others in the biblical context. They effectively connected forgiveness to God's love, the power of sin, the Christian witness, personal peace, and the command of God. The biblical examples and conclusion further solidified their argument. However, the student could have directly incorporated the idea that forgiveness reflects God's unconditional love more explicitly, as stated in the reference answer, to achieve a perfect score.
