  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly addresses the concern of encouraging the practice of forgiveness as a reflection of God's love in daily interactions. The writer provides a clear biblical foundation for forgiveness, highlighting its importance in reflecting God's unconditional love and promoting healthy relationships. The examples provided from Scripture further solidify the importance of forgiveness in Christian living.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in its scope. While the writer does provide some biblical support for their points, they could have delved deeper into specific biblical passages to further illustrate their claims. Additionally, the conclusion could be more concise and focused on summarizing the main points rather than simply reiterating them.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a strong foundation for encouraging the practice of forgiveness in daily interactions, and I would give it a grade of 95."
