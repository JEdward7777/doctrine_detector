The Bible paints a profound and enduring picture of marriage as a divinely ordained institution. The 'bond of marriage' is more than just a legal contract or social arrangement. It is a spiritual and physical union between two consenting adults, reflecting the covenant relationship between Christ and His Church.

**Biblical Foundation:**

* Genesis 2:24: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and hold fast to his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
* Matthew 19:4-6: "Have you not read that he who made them male and female made them for marriage? For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh?"
* 1 Corinthians 6:14: "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral."

**Commitment and Significance:**

* **Mutual Exclusivity:** The bond of marriage is characterized by exclusivity between partners, reflecting God's unconditional love for His Church.
* **Mutual Responsibility:** Husband and wife are responsible for nurturing and supporting one another, both spiritually and physically.
* **Fruitfulness and Purpose:** Marriage is designed for companionship, procreation, and the development of God's kingdom.
* **Divine Partnership:** The bond of marriage reflects the covenantal relationship between Christ and His Church, where forgiveness, grace, and commitment are central.

**How Couples Should View Their Commitment:**

* **Commitment to God:** The marriage covenant is ultimately a commitment to God, who ordained marriage and provides strength and guidance.
* **Mutual Forgiveness and Grace:** Couples are called to extend forgiveness and grace to one another, just as Christ has forgiven them.
