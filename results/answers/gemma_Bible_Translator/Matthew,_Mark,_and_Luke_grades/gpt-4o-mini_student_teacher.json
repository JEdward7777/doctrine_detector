  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate answer, citing specific passages from the Gospel accounts where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. They demonstrated a good understanding of the question and effectively referenced relevant biblical texts. The only minor deduction is for including Acts 1:13 as it does not specifically list the names of the twelve disciples, but overall their response aligns well with a Christian worldview."
