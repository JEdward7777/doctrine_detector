  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is accurate and provides detailed references to the biblical passages where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. However, it could be improved by mentioning that the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are the only books in the New Testament that contain lists of the twelve disciples."
