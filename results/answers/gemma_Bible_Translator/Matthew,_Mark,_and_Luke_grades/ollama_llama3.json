However, it does not provide specific details about where exactly these lists can be found in each Gospel account. For example, it mentions that \"various places\" throughout the New Testament have listings of the twelve disciples, but it does not specify which passages contain these listings.\n\nTo improve on this response, it would be helpful to include more detailed information about the specific passages and their locations within the texts. Additionally, while the concern is primarily focused on being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, it would also be beneficial to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the significance and relevance of the disciples' names and roles in the context of Christian theology.\n\nIn terms of meeting the concern, this response shows some familiarity with the Gospel accounts, but could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of their teachings and implications for faith."
