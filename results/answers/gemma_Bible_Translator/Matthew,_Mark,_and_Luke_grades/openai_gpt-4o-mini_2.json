  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies where the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the New Testament, citing specific passages in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Acts. However, the response could have further elaborated on the significance of these disciples within the context of the Gospel accounts and their teachings to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the material. A Christian worldview would emphasize the importance of these disciples in spreading the teachings of Jesus and the role they played in establishing the early church."
