The biblical references are relevant and support the theological significance outlined. The explanation of the fulfillment of prophecy, divine authority, messianic identity, and universal rulership is clear and doctrinally sound. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on how Jesus' kingship fulfills specific Old Testament prophecies and how it relates to his atoning work on the cross for all people, not just the nation of Israel. Overall, a strong response with room for deeper theological exploration."
