  "grade": 87.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 87\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively explains the significance of the title \"King of the Jews\" in relation to Jesus' identity as the Messiah by providing relevant biblical references, theological insights, and interpretation. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview. However, the grade is slightly lower than perfect as the student's answer included additional theological insights and interpretations beyond what was explicitly mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
