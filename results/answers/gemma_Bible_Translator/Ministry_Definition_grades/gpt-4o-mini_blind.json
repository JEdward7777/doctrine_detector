  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that aligns with biblical principles of ministry. They have effectively highlighted the key aspects of ministering to others according to the Bible, emphasizing love, humility, compassion, service, and evangelism. The references to relevant scripture verses further support their points. The only area for slight improvement would be to include more direct references to Jesus as the ultimate example of ministry and the source of empowerment for believers to carry out ministry effectively."
