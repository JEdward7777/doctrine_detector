  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly addresses the concern by providing a comprehensive biblical definition of ministry, highlighting its various aspects (compassionate service, spiritual nourishment, practical support, and evangelism) and key principles (humility, compassion, service, and love). The inclusion of specific biblical passages and verses further supports this understanding. \n\nThe only area where it falls short is in the summary statement, which could be rephrased to more explicitly emphasize the biblical foundation for ministry. Nonetheless, overall, this response effectively addresses the concern and provides a clear, biblical understanding of what it means to minister.\n\nComment: Well-done! Your comprehensive approach to defining ministry according to the Bible is commendable. The inclusion of specific verses and passages strengthens your argument, making it an excellent example of how to thoughtfully address the concern."
