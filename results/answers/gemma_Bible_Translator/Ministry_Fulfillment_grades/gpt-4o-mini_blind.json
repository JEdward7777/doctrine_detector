  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response outlining key aspects of fulfilling one's ministry as a Christian Bible translator. The emphasis on accuracy, integrity, illumination, evangelization, discipleship, service to the Church, obedience, witness, humility, and dependence on God is commendable. However, to achieve a higher grade, the student could have further expounded on how the translator's work aligns with the overarching mission of spreading the gospel and building up the body of Christ globally. Additional Scriptural references supporting the importance of faithful translation work could have also strengthened the answer."
