  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated framework for fulfilling one's ministry as a Christian Bible translator. It addresses key aspects such as accuracy, integrity, illumination, evangelization, discipleship, service to the church, obedience, witness, humility, and dependence on God. The emphasis on aligning with God's purpose and serving others is evident throughout the outline. The grade is slightly lower due to the lack of direct integration of the specific answer provided into the outlined principles. Making a clearer connection between the defined principles and the central idea of fulfilling one's calling from God would strengthen the overall coherence of the response."
