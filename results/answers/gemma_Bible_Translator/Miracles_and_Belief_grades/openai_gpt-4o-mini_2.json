It effectively ties in the importance of miracles for evangelism and personal faith, aligning well with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the role of miracles as signs pointing to God's existence and intervention in the world. The only improvement could be to further emphasize the centrality of a personal relationship with God in the context of faith as mentioned in the additional concern."
