Grade: 20

Comment: The student correctly acknowledged the lack of explicit explanation in the Bible regarding the significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth. However, a higher grade could have been achieved by drawing upon traditional Christian interpretation and symbolic meanings commonly associated with myrrh in biblical context, such as its use in burial customs and foreshadowing of Jesus' sacrificial death for humanity's redemption.
