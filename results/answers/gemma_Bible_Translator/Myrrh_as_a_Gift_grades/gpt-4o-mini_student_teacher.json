  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student showed awareness that the significance of myrrh in relation to Jesus' birth is not explicitly stated in the Bible. However, from a Christian perspective, understanding the symbolism of the gifts given to Jesus can provide insights into his purpose and mission. In this case, myrrh symbolizes Jesus' future suffering and sacrificial death for humanity's sins, which is a significant aspect of Christian theology. Therefore, the student's answer lacked the essential connection to Christ's sacrificial role as the Messiah, resulting in a lower grade."
