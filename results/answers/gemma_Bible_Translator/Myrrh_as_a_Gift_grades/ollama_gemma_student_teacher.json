  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the symbolic significance of gifts in relation to Jesus' purpose and mission. However, the response lacks specific textual evidence or theological interpretation of the myrrh's significance as related to Christ's suffering and death. Including such insights would elevate the quality of the response."
