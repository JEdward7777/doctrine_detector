  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe concern is to understand the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus, which can deepen one's appreciation of his purpose and mission. The original response provided does attempt to provide some insight into the symbolic meaning of myrrh, stating that it represented Jesus' future suffering and death. While not directly addressing the concern, this response does touch on the idea that the gifts given to Jesus have significance beyond just their material value.\n\nHowever, the response is lacking in specific biblical references or supporting evidence for its interpretation. Additionally, it may be helpful to further develop the idea of how the symbolism of myrrh can deepen one's appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission. Nevertheless, the attempt to explore the symbolic meaning of myrrh does demonstrate a willingness to engage with the concern.\n\nComment: While this response makes an effort to address the concern, it could be improved by incorporating more specific biblical references and further developing the idea of how the symbolism of myrrh can enhance one's understanding of Jesus' purpose and mission."
