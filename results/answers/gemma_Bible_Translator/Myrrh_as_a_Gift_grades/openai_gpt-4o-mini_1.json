While it is true that the Bible does not explicitly state the meaning of myrrh as a gift, understanding this symbolism can indeed deepen one's appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission, as highlighted in the concern provided. The response effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview by connecting the gift of myrrh to Jesus's redemptive work for humanity."
