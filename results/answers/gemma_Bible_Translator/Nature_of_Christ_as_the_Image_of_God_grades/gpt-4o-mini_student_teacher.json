  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer about Jesus as the image of God, citing relevant biblical references and explaining the significance in Christian belief. The student effectively highlighted various key aspects of Jesus as the image of God and how this concept is foundational to Christian faith. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly emphasizing Jesus' divinity as the central aspect of being the image of God, in line with the reference teacher answer provided."
