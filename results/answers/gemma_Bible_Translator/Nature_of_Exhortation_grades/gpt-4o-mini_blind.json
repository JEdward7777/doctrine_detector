The emphasis on basing exhortation on Scripture, authenticity, humility, clarity, encouragement, practical guidance, context-specificity, authenticity, accountability, and continuous growth aligns well with biblical principles. The student could enhance the response by including specific New Testament passages that support each point and emphasizing the importance of prayer and reliance on the Holy Spirit in the exhortation process. Overall, a good understanding of the topic is evident, but further depth and scriptural references would strengthen the answer."
