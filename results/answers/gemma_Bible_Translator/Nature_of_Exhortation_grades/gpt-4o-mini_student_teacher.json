  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70/100\n\nComment: \nWhile the student provided a thorough and well-structured answer outlining various aspects of how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament, they missed the core teaching emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The central focus on exhorting in love, not harshly or abruptly, is crucial in the Christian context as it aligns closely with the teachings of Jesus on love and compassion. The student's detailed points are commendable, but the omission of this foundational principle affects the overall alignment with a Christian worldview."
