  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-structured approach to exhortation in line with Christian teachings. It addresses the concern of delivering encouragement lovingly and supportively through principles grounded in Scripture, authenticity, clarity, encouragement, and practical guidance. The suggestions align closely with the Christian worldview of showing love and humility in exhorting others. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect each point to the overarching principle of exhorting in love, as emphasized in the original answer."
