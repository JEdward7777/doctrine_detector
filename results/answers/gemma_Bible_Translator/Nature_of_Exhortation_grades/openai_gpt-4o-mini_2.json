The emphasis on Scriptural foundation, authenticity, humility, clarity, encouragement, and continuous growth reflects a holistic and Christian-specific perspective on exhortation. The only potential improvement could be to explicitly connect each point back to the initial statement that exhortation should be done in love, to further emphasize the importance of this central aspect in Christian exhortation."
