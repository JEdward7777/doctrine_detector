- This balance is crucial for restoring relationship with God.

- By forgiving others, we become mirrors reflecting God's forgiving love.

- God's forgiveness is not merely a legal transaction, but a reflection of his character.
- His forgiving love reveals his deep desire for reconciliation and restoration in his relationship with humanity.

**6. God's Forgiveness Leads to Gratitude and Obedience:**
