The explanation of God as a spirit being and the influence on worship is generally well-supported with relevant Bible verses and theological reflections. The response could be enhanced by providing more direct connections to how understanding God as Spirit impacts personal worship practices and the importance of spiritual discernment in worship. Additionally, emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding and empowering believers in worship would further strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
