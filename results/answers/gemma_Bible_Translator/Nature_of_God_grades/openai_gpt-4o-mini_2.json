It effectively highlights the implications of recognizing God's spiritual nature on worship practices and personal spiritual growth. The emphasis on humility, reverence, and reliance on the Holy Spirit in worship aligns well with a Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the concern of appropriately connecting with God in worship within the response."
