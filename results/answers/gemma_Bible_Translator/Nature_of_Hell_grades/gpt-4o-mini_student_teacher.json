  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the nature and experience of hell in the Bible, covering key aspects such as separation from God, torment and suffering, permanent punishment, God's justice and mercy, and the importance of evangelism. They referenced relevant Bible passages to support their points effectively. However, the student could have incorporated more direct quotations from the Bible to strengthen their argument further and align more closely with the succinct reference answer provided by the teacher."
