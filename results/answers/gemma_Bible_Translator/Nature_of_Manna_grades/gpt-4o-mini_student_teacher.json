However, the knowledge of manna being white flakes that tasted sweet like honey is essential in understanding the miraculous provision of God as depicted in the Bible. In this case, integrating the reference answer's insight with acknowledgment of the limited descriptive details in the Bible would lead to a more comprehensive explanation."
