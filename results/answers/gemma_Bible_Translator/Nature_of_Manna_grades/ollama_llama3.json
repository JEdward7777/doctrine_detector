  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response correctly acknowledges that the Bible does not provide descriptive information about the appearance or taste of manna, which shows an understanding of the limitations of biblical text. However, it could have taken the opportunity to explore the miraculous provision of God in a more meaningful way by discussing how the lack of description may be intentionally divine revelation.\n\nThe response also doesn't attempt to reconcile its inability to provide an answer with the concern about understanding the miraculous provision of God. A higher grade would require the response to take this concern into account and provide some insight or reflection on what we can learn from God's mysterious ways, even in the absence of descriptive information."
