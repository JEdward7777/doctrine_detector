  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the relationship between scripture and the Word of God within a Christian worldview. The answer effectively explains the significance of both terms, their connection, and their role in understanding God's revelation. The inclusion of biblical references and theological insights enhances the depth of the response. However, the student could have included more emphasis on the specific concern of clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word as outlined in the teacher's reference answer."
