  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and scripturally supported analysis of how individuals can be considered 'wicked' according to the Bible. They thoroughly discuss various sinful actions and attitudes, along with the consequences of such wickedness. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses strengthens their response. However, more emphasis could have been placed on the possibility of repentance and redemption for those deemed wicked, as the Christian worldview also strongly emphasizes God's mercy and grace offered through Christ. A more balanced view of the potential for transformation and forgiveness would have further enriched the answer."
