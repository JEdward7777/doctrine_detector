  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the distinctions between soul and spirit in the Bible. They have accurately described the composition and functions of both concepts and supported their answer with relevant scriptural references. However, the answer could be improved by acknowledging the nuanced understanding that the Bible sometimes presents 'soul' and 'spirit' as potentially interchangeable terms, as noted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Understanding this aspect would enhance the accuracy of interpretation when encountering variations in the biblical text."
