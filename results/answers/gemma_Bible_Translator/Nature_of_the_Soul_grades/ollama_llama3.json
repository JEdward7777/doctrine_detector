  "grade_comment": "I'm happy to help!\n\nGrade: 85\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts of soul and spirit, providing clear definitions and scriptural references for each. The distinctions between the two are well-articulated, highlighting their different compositions (physical vs. immaterial), functions (earthly life vs. spiritual things), and contexts.\n\nHowever, to reach a perfect score, the response could have explicitly addressed the concern of accurately interpreting scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God. While the provided information does contribute to this understanding, it would be strengthened by direct application to biblical passages or discussions about these topics.\n\nThe additional notes at the end are a great addition, highlighting the unity of body, mind, and spirit as well as their dependence on God. Overall, this response is well-structured, informative, and shows a solid grasp of the biblical concepts being discussed."
