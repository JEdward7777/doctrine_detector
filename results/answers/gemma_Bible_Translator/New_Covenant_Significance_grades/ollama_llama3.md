The response partially addresses the concern by highlighting Jesus' sacrifice as the foundation of the New Covenant, which atones for people's sins forever. However, it does not fully capture the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises.

The response provides a good overview of the significance of the New Covenant, discussing its fulfillment of the Old Covenant, access to God's grace, and other benefits. It also recognizes the universal inclusivity and hope and purpose that come with accepting the New Covenant. However, it could be more explicit in highlighting the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice.

To improve this response, it would be helpful to provide specific examples or biblical references that illustrate how Jesus' sacrifice has transformed people's lives in the context of God's promises. This could include stories of personal transformation or examples of how the New Covenant has empowered believers to live a life pleasing to God.
