Grade: 90

Comment: The student's answer provides a thorough and insightful examination of how Christians should approach and understand the Psalms in light of the New Testament. They effectively use relevant passages to support their points and offer practical guidance for Christian application. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to explicitly mention Jesus' own use and affirmation of the Psalms in the New Testament, as His teachings and actions provide a crucial foundation for understanding the role of the Psalms in Christian faith and practice.
