## Every Believer a Priest in the New Testament

The New Testament reveals a radical truth: **every believer in Jesus is considered a priest**. This concept is foundational to understanding our identity in Christ and the empowerment we receive through the Holy Spirit.

**Biblical Basis:**

* **1 Peter 2:9:** "You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God."
* **Revelation 1:6:** "I am the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. With him every believer is a priest."
* **Exodus 19:6:** "You shall be for me a kingdom of priests."

**Meaning:**

* **Intercession:** Believers are empowered to intercede for themselves and others, offering prayers and praises to God in Jesus' name.
* **Ministry:** Every believer is equipped for ministry, using their unique gifts to serve God and others. 
* **Identity:** Through Christ, believers are declared "holy priesthood," reflecting God's holiness in their lives.
