  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament, supported by relevant biblical references. The emphasis on direct access to God through Christ, the aspect of intercession, ministry, and identity as priests in Christ is well articulated. The student effectively communicates the meaning and implications of this doctrine with clarity and insight. Consideration could be given to further expanding on the role of priests as representatives reconciling humanity with God or the significance of believers being part of a royal priesthood."
