  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers, supported by relevant biblical references and practical implications. The answer effectively emphasized the key aspects of the priesthood, such as direct access to God, intercession, ministry, and identity in Christ. However, the student's response was slightly longer and more detailed than the reference answer, which could potentially be seen as adding unnecessary information. Nonetheless, the depth of understanding and clarity in articulating the significance of every believer being a priest warrant a high grade."
