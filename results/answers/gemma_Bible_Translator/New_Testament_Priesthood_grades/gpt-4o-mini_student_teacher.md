## Every Believer a Priest in the New Testament

The New Testament reveals a radical truth: **every believer in Jesus is considered a priest**. This concept is foundational to understanding our identity in Christ and the empowerment we receive through the Holy Spirit.

**Biblical Basis:**

* **1 Peter 2:9:** "You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God."
* **Revelation 1:6:** "I am the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. With him every believer is a priest."
* **Exodus 19:6:** "You shall be for me a kingdom of priests."

**Meaning:**

* **Access to God:** Priesthood in the New Testament isn't about performing rituals or offering sacrifices. It's about having direct access to God through Christ, the ultimate High Priest. 
* **Intercession:** Believers are empowered to intercede for themselves and others, offering prayers and praises to God in Jesus' name.
* **Ministry:** Every believer is equipped for ministry, using their unique gifts to serve God and others. 
* **Identity:** Through Christ, believers are declared "holy priesthood," reflecting God's holiness in their lives.

**Implications:**

* Every believer can approach God directly through Christ, regardless of their background, training, or experience.
* Every believer has the responsibility to develop their spiritual life and grow in their faith.
* Every believer is called to use their talents and skills to serve God and others.

**Conclusion:**

The priesthood of all believers is a vital aspect of Christian life, empowering individuals to experience God, engage in prayer and intercession, and fulfill their unique roles in God's kingdom.

Grade: 90

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers, supported by relevant biblical references and practical implications. The answer effectively emphasized the key aspects of the priesthood, such as direct access to God, intercession, ministry, and identity in Christ. However, the student's response was slightly longer and more detailed than the reference answer, which could potentially be seen as adding unnecessary information. Nonetheless, the depth of understanding and clarity in articulating the significance of every believer being a priest warrant a high grade.
