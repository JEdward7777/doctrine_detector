  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: \nThe response provides a clear and systematic comparison of purification concepts between the Old and New Testaments. The key differences are well-explained, and the underlying continuity is highlighted effectively. The connections drawn between the two testaments demonstrate a good understanding of the topic. The conclusion is concise and summarizes the evolution of purification concepts accurately. \n\nTo improve the grade, the student could have included more specific references to biblical passages that illustrate the concepts of purification in both testaments. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of the shift from ritualistic to moral purity could have enhanced the analysis. Overall, a solid response with room for further depth and biblical support."
