  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response effectively compares and contrasts the concept of purification in the Old and New Testaments, highlighting key differences and similarities. The student accurately identifies the shift in emphasis from ritual to moral purity in the New Testament, emphasizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification from sin. However, the student could improve the answer by explicitly mentioning the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification, as indicated in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective."
