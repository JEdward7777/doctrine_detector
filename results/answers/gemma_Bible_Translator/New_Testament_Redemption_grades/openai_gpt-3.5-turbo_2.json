It acknowledges the significance of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of eternal purification from sin, aligning well with the concern given. The only slight improvement could have been to explicitly link the concept of Christ's sacrifice as the final and complete means of purification in both the original response and the comparison with the Old Testament."
