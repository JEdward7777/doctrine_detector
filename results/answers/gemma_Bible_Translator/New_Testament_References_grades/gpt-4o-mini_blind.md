Comment: The student correctly stated that there is no explicit evidence in the New Testament suggesting that John the Baptist was a Nazirite. However, the answer could have been improved by mentioning that while the New Testament does not specifically state that John the Baptist was a Nazirite, there are certain similarities between his life and the Nazirite vow, such as his separation and dedication to God's work. Encouraging the student to provide a more nuanced response in the future.
