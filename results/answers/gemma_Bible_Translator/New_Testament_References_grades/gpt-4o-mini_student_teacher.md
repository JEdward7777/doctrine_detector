Comment: The student provided an accurate response by stating that there is no explicit mention in the New Testament of John the Baptist being a Nazirite. However, the student should have further elaborated on the significance of the angel's announcement to Zechariah as evidence suggesting John's adherence to Nazirite practices, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer.
