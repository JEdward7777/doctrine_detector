## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** 
The student correctly acknowledges that there is no explicit evidence in the New Testament suggesting that John the Baptist was a Nazirite. However, they fail to engage with the teacher's reference answer, which suggests that the angel's announcement to Zechariah about John's abstaining from strong drink aligns with the Nazirite vow. The student could have elaborated on this connection to improve their grade.
