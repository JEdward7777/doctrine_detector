  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that touched on key aspects of the purpose of Noah's Ark, connecting it to preservation, God's covenant, judgment, and a new beginning. The answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, showing a strong understanding of the story's significance in the context of God's plan for salvation and preservation. However, there could have been more emphasis on the aspect of protection as the core purpose of the Ark in the student's response."
