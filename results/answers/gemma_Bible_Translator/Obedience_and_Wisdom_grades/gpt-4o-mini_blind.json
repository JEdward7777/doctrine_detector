  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively articulates how listening to God connects to becoming wise from a Christian worldview. The student references relevant biblical texts to support their points and demonstrates a clear understanding of the connection between seeking God's wisdom and growing in spiritual maturity. The answer could be further enhanced by incorporating additional scriptural references or theological depth, but overall, it provides a strong and doctrinally sound perspective on the topic."
