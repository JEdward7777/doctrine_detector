  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of how the priests in the Old Testament carried out their ministry in the temple, covering various aspects such as sacrificial rituals, cleansing rituals, teaching, intercession, worship attendance, and temple maintenance. However, the specific concern highlighted the importance of understanding sacrificial service, and the reference answer focused on the core aspects of offering sacrifices, caring for the temple, and praying for the people. While the student's answer is detailed and informative, it could have been more focused on the sacrificial aspect of the priestly ministry to align closely with the concern provided."
