  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies a core aspect of the priests' ministry in the Old Testament by mentioning offering sacrifices, taking care of the temple, and praying for the people. However, it falls short of fully engaging with the more detailed and comprehensive explanation provided in the original text. Incorporating elements such as cleansing rituals, teaching and interpretation, intercession, worship attendance, and temple maintenance would have demonstrated a deeper understanding of how the practices of the Old Testament priests can inform current ministry approaches. Although the response is partially correct, a more robust connection between the Old Testament practices and contemporary ministry could have been made to receive a higher grade."
