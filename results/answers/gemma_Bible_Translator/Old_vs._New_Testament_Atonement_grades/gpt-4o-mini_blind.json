It correctly highlights the shift from temporary sacrifices in the Old Testament to Christ's ultimate and complete atonement in the New Testament. The explanation is supported with relevant scriptural references and key differences are well articulated. The only improvement could be to further emphasize the centrality of Christ in the continuity between both testaments regarding God's redemptive plan."
