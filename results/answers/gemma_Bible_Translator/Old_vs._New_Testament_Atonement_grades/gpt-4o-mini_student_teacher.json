  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response effectively compares the concepts of atonement in the Old and New Testaments, highlighting key differences such as the temporary nature of Old Testament sacrifices versus the permanent nature of Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament. The student also accurately identifies the shift from repeated offerings in the Old Testament to Christ's single, sufficient sacrifice in the New Testament. The student effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
