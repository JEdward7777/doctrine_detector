It highlights key differences, such as the nature of atonement, focus, and completion, and supports the explanation with relevant biblical references. The response also emphasizes the foundational continuity between the Old and New Testaments in God's plan for atonement, showing a solid understanding of Christian theological concepts. Great job!"
