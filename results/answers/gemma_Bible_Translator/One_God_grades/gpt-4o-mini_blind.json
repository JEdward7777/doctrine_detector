The emphasis on contextual translation, clarity, precision, and emphasizing God's transcendence is commendable. However, there is a significant concern regarding the suggestion to avoid language that suggests God is the only deity or ultimate authority. As Christians, we believe in the exclusivity of God as revealed in the Bible, and translating that truth should not be compromised to accommodate other beliefs. The use of inclusive language should not dilute the unique nature of God as the only true God. It is crucial to maintain doctrinal correctness and the integrity of the biblical text above cultural sensitivities in this context."
