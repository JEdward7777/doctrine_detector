They acknowledge the cultural context and suggest using inclusive language while maintaining theological conviction. However, the answer could be improved by placing a stronger emphasis on the unique nature of God and the importance of upholding biblical monotheism without compromise. The student should prioritize highlighting the Trinity and God's distinctiveness in a clearer and more direct manner to align better with the given concern from a Christian worldview."
