  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-organized explanation of the historical and religious significance of the Festival of Weeks before the events described in the New Testament. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly connecting the festival to its fulfillment in Christ, as this was the specified concern. The student did touch on some pre-Christian interpretations and early Christian parallels but could have elaborated more on how the Festival of Weeks foreshadowed the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost in connection to Christ."
