It also briefly alludes to the parallels between the festival and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost in Christian tradition, acknowledging the festival's potential connection to fulfillment in Christ. However, there could have been further elaboration on how Pentecost in the New Testament reflects the ultimate fulfillment of the Festival of Weeks in the Christian context, emphasizing the significance of Christ's work in the celebration."
