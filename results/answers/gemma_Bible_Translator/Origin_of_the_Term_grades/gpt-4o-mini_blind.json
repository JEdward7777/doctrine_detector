  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and historically accurate overview of the origins of the term \"Christian\" and its early usage. The student effectively differentiates between non-canonical sources and those within the New Testament, providing relevant examples such as Tacitus and Josephus. The explanation of the Greek origins of the term is also well articulated. However, to enhance this response further, the student could strengthen it by including references to specific New Testament passages that describe the followers of Jesus. Overall, this is a well-researched and informative answer."
