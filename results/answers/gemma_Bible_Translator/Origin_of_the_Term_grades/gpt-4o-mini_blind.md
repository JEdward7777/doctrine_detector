## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The earliest references to Christians as a group appear in non-canonical sources from the late first century AD. The New Testament itself does not contain the first instances of the term "Christian."

**First known references:**

* **Tacitus (c. 98 AD)**: Roman historian who mentions "Christians, who by their worship of a remarkable savior Christ, are hated by the Jews."
* **Josephus (c. 100 AD)**: Jewish historian who occasionally uses the term "Christians" in his writings.

**Within the New Testament:**

* The term "Christian" is not explicitly used by the apostles or other New Testament writers to describe Jesus' followers.
* Early Christians were primarily referred to as "followers of Christ," "believers," or "brethren."

**Origins of the term:**

* The term "Christian" is believed to derive from the Greek word "christianos," meaning "follower" or "imitator."
* It was likely first used by non-Christians to describe those who adhered to Christ's teachings.

Comment: This answer provides a comprehensive and historically accurate overview of the origins of the term "Christian" and its early usage. The student effectively differentiates between non-canonical sources and those within the New Testament, providing relevant examples such as Tacitus and Josephus. The explanation of the Greek origins of the term is also well articulated. However, to enhance this response further, the student could strengthen it by including references to specific New Testament passages that describe the followers of Jesus. Overall, this is a well-researched and informative answer.
