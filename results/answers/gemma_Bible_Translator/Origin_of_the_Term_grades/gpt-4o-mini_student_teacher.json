  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer detailing the historical context and significance of the term \"Christian.\" They correctly identified the early references to Christians in non-canonical sources and explained the origins of the term. However, the student did not directly answer the specific question of where Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians,' which was in Antioch according to the reference answer. This oversight slightly detracts from the overall grade."
