Recognizing historical context and significance of the term 'Christian'.

## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The earliest references to Christians as a group appear in non-canonical sources from the late first century AD. The New Testament itself does not contain the first instances of the term "Christian."

**First known references:**

* **Tacitus (c. 98 AD)**: Roman historian who mentions "Christians, who by their worship of a remarkable savior Christ, are hated by the Jews."
* **Josephus (c. 100 AD)**: Jewish historian who occasionally uses the term "Christians" in his writings.

**Within the New Testament:**

* The term "Christian" is not explicitly used by the apostles or other New Testament writers to describe Jesus' followers.
* Early Christians were primarily referred to as "followers of Christ," "believers," or "brethren."

**Origins of the term:**

* The term "Christian" is believed to derive from the Greek word "christianos," meaning "follower" or "imitator."
* It was likely first used by non-Christians to describe those who adhered to Christ's teachings.

**Grade: 80/100**

**Comment:**

The student's answer provides a thorough and well-researched explanation of the origins and first mentions of the term "Christian." It correctly points out that the New Testament does not contain the first instances of the term and cites reliable historical sources from the late first century AD. The student's explanation of the Greek origin of the word "christianos" and its initial usage by non-Christians is also accurate. However, the answer lacks specific mention of the city of Antioch, which according to tradition was the first place where Jesus' followers were called "Christians."
