Where were Jesus' followers first called 'Christians'?

## Correct Answer
Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in the city of Antioch.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing historical context and significance of the term 'Christian'.

## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The earliest references to Christians as a group appear in non-canonical sources from the late first century AD. The New Testament itself does not contain the first instances of the term "Christian."

**First known references:**

* **Tacitus (c. 98 AD)**: Roman historian who mentions "Christians, who by their worship of a remarkable savior Christ, are hated by the Jews."
* **Josephus (c. 100 AD)**: Jewish historian who occasionally uses the term "Christians" in his writings.

**Within the New Testament:**

* The term "Christian" is not explicitly used by the apostles or other New Testament writers to describe Jesus' followers.
* Early Christians were primarily referred to as "followers of Christ," "believers," or "brethren."

**Origins of the term:**

* The term "Christian" is believed to derive from the Greek word "christianos," meaning "follower" or "imitator."
* It was likely first used by non-Christians to describe those who adhered to Christ's teachings.

I would give this response a score of 40.

While the response does acknowledge that Jesus' followers were referred to as "Christians" in the city of Antioch, it fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the historical context and significance of the term. The original text provides much more nuanced information about the earliest references to Christians, including non-canonical sources like Tacitus and Josephus, which are not mentioned in this response.

Additionally, the response does not fully address the concern by failing to discuss the origins of the term "Christian" or its use within the New Testament. Instead, it provides a simplistic statement that is not supported by historical evidence.

To improve this response, I would suggest providing more detailed information about the earliest references to Christians and their significance in understanding the development of Christian identity.
