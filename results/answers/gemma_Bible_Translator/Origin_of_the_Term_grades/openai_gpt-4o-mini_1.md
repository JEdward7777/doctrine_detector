Recognizing historical context and significance of the term 'Christian'.

## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The earliest references to Christians as a group appear in non-canonical sources from the late first century AD. The New Testament itself does not contain the first instances of the term "Christian."

**First known references:**

* **Tacitus (c. 98 AD)**: Roman historian who mentions "Christians, who by their worship of a remarkable savior Christ, are hated by the Jews."
* **Josephus (c. 100 AD)**: Jewish historian who occasionally uses the term "Christians" in his writings.

**Within the New Testament:**

* The term "Christian" is not explicitly used by the apostles or other New Testament writers to describe Jesus' followers.
* Early Christians were primarily referred to as "followers of Christ," "believers," or "brethren."

**Origins of the term:**

* The term "Christian" is believed to derive from the Greek word "christianos," meaning "follower" or "imitator."
* It was likely first used by non-Christians to describe those who adhered to Christ's teachings.

Grade: 80
Comment: The response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the origins and early references of the term "Christian," showing a good understanding of the historical context and significance. However, the initial statement given in the answer that Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in the city of Antioch is incorrect based on the historical references provided. A higher grade could have been achieved by addressing this discrepancy.
