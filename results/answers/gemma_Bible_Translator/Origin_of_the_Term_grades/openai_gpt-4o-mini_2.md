# Correct Answer
Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in the city of Antioch.

# Stated Concern
Recognizing historical context and significance of the term 'Christian'.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The earliest references to Christians as a group appear in non-canonical sources from the late first century AD. The New Testament itself does not contain the first instances of the term "Christian."

**First known references:**

* **Tacitus (c. 98 AD)**: Roman historian who mentions "Christians, who by their worship of a remarkable savior Christ, are hated by the Jews."
* **Josephus (c. 100 AD)**: Jewish historian who occasionally uses the term "Christians" in his writings.

**Within the New Testament:**

* The term "Christian" is not explicitly used by the apostles or other New Testament writers to describe Jesus' followers.
* Early Christians were primarily referred to as "followers of Christ," "believers," or "brethren."

**Origins of the term:**

* The term "Christian" is believed to derive from the Greek word "christianos," meaning "follower" or "imitator."
* It was likely first used by non-Christians to describe those who adhered to Christ's teachings.

Comment: The response provides accurate historical context surrounding the term "Christian," citing reputable sources such as Tacitus and Josephus. The explanation of the term's origin and evolution is well-supported. However, deducting some points for not directly addressing the claim that Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in Antioch, which is a specific concern raised. Additionally, emphasizing the broader historical context and significance of the term 'Christian' within early Christianity could further enhance the response. Overall, a strong and informative answer.
