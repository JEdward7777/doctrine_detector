## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The biblical account of Hebrews' ancestry is complex and debated among theologians. However, based on the scriptures, the traditional understanding is that the Hebrews descend from Abraham through his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob (also known as Israel).

**Biblical Account:**

* **Abraham:** The patriarch of the Hebrew people, from whom all believers are descended.
* **Isaac:** Son of Abraham and heir to the covenant.
* **Jacob:** Son of Isaac, who received the birthright and became the progenitor of the twelve tribes of Israel.

**Traditional Interpretation:**

* The twelve tribes of Israel are descended from Jacob's twelve sons.
* The descendants of these tribes are known as the "Hebrews" or "Israelites."
* Throughout biblical history, the term "Hebrew" often refers to the descendants of Jacob, encompassing both the ancient Israelites and the later Jewish people.

**Contemporary Perspectives:**

* Some scholars argue that the biblical account of Abraham's origins is historically inaccurate.
* Others suggest that the term "Hebrew" was used in ancient times to describe various groups of people in the Middle East, not necessarily a specific ethnicity.

**Christian Theological Understanding:**

* The Bible teaches that all believers are part of God's chosen people, regardless of their ethnic background.
* The spiritual descendants of Abraham are those who have faith in Jesus Christ.

**Conclusion:**

The biblical lineage of the Hebrews is a complex and multifaceted issue with both theological and historical dimensions. While the traditional understanding is that the Hebrews descend from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob, there are ongoing debates and interpretations regarding the exact origins of the Hebrew people.
