## [Answer](../Pardon_in_Christianity.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The concept of pardon is closely related to God's forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ in Christianity.** 

Here's how these two concepts are interconnected:

**1. Pardon is God's judicial act of forgiving sins:**

* It refers to the legal cancellation of the penalty for sin. 
* God's pardon is not based on human merit or works, but solely on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which covers the penalty for our sins.

**2. Forgiveness is God's compassionate act of wiping the slate clean:**

* Forgiveness involves God's unconditional love and mercy, offering new life to those who repent of their sins. 
* It means that God no longer holds our sins against us.

**3. Pardon is a legal declaration of forgiveness, while forgiveness is a deep emotional response:**

* Pardon is a judicial act that legally declares that our sins are forgiven. 
* Forgiveness, on the other hand, is a personal response to God's pardon, involving genuine sorrow for sin and a commitment to live in obedience to God.

**The Bible teaches:**

* **Jesus Christ is the only one who can offer true forgiveness:** "Forgiveness is freely given – because of his great love. He did this while we were still sinners" (Romans 5:8).
* **Forgiveness is a complete and final act:** "He himself is the forgiveness” (Colossians 1:14).
* **Forgiveness is available to all who repent:** "Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and beloved, you can confidently approach God through Christ and receive forgiveness of your sins" (Ephesians 1:8).

**In essence, God's pardon is the legal basis for forgiveness, while forgiveness is the heartfelt response to God's gracious offer of pardon.**
