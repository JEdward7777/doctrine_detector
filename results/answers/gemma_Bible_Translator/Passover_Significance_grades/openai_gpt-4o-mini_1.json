It effectively explains how Jesus fulfills the symbolism of the Passover lamb through His sacrifice and offers a clear Christian perspective on the significance of celebrating Passover. The biblical parallels are well-drawn and the response effectively highlights the central message of Christianity in relation to Passover. Great job!"
