However, the student could have tied these lessons more explicitly to the concern of encouraging perseverance and faith in difficult circumstances. The answer could have been more centered on how Paul's example in Lystra specifically teaches Christians to persevere in their faith and ministry despite hardships. Overall, a solid response with room for a bit more focus on the specified concern."
