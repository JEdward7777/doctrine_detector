**The process works like this:**

1. **God's love for us compels Jesus to offer himself as a sacrifice** for our sins (John 3:16).
2. **Through faith, we receive the benefits of Jesus' sacrifice** (John 1:12).
3. **Our sins are forgiven, and God's righteousness is credited to us** (Romans 3:22, 4:23).

**Therefore, peace with God is achieved through:**

* **Acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice** as the payment for our sins.
* **Faith in Jesus as the Son of God** and the Savior.
* **A transformed life** that reflects God's love and righteousness.

**Supporting Scriptural References:**
