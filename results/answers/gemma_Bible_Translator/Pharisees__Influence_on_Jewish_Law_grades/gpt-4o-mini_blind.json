The points made are sound doctrinally and show an understanding of the historical context. However, adding scriptural references to support the claims would enhance the depth of the analysis. Additionally, emphasizing Jesus' fulfillment of the Law as prophesied in the Old Testament could further strengthen the argument. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
