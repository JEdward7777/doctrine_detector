They identified key points such as conflict, misunderstanding, distancing from the faith, division within Judaism, and influence on early Christians. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the spiritual aspect of the Pharisees' legalism and how it contrasted with Jesus' teachings on grace and love. Additionally, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes the importance of focusing on the spirit of the law, which could have been emphasized more in the student's response."
