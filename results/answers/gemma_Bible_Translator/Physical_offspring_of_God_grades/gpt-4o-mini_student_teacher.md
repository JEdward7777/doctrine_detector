Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a thorough and well-rounded answer addressing the concern effectively by emphasizing the spiritual nature of the term "Son of God," using parallel imagery, contextualizing the terminology, addressing literal interpretations, and promoting clarity and understanding. The inclusion of various strategies and explanations align with the Christian perspective to prevent doctrinal errors and retain biblical terminology. However, the reference answer from the teacher was more concise and directly focused on emphasizing Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God. The student's response, while comprehensive, could have been more focused and succinct to align more closely with the reference.
