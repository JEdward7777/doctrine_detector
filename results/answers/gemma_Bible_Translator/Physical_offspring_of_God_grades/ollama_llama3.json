However, it could be more comprehensive by emphasizing the spiritual relationship, using parallel imagery, contextualizing the terminology, and addressing literal interpretations, as suggested in the original guidelines. The response is clear and concise but lacks some of the depth and nuance that would make it a more robust and effective teaching tool."
