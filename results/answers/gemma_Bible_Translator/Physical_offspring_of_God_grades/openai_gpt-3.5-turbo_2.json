  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation that aligns with Christian beliefs regarding the term \"Son of God\" and its significance. The concern about preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology is addressed effectively through emphasizing the spiritual nature of Jesus' relationship with God. However, the response could be improved by incorporating additional details and strategies provided in the suggested response, such as using parallel imagery and contextualizing the biblical terminology further. Overall, the response is strong but could benefit from a more comprehensive approach."
