However, the response could be strengthened by incorporating more detailed explanations from the provided guidance, especially in terms of contextualizing the terminology and addressing literal interpretations. Additionally, including more references to relevant biblical parallels and seeking clarity through further resources would enhance the overall depth of the response."
