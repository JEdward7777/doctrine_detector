The approach of examining context, language, theological interpretations, author's intent, and consulting resources is commendable. The use of biblical examples to illustrate physical death and spiritual perishing is effective in reinforcing the explanation. However, to improve this response, the student could further elaborate on the specific doctrinal perspectives within Christian theology that inform the understanding of 'perish,' such as the doctrine of salvation, atonement, and eternal life. Additionally, tying in more scriptural references and theological insights would strengthen the argument and provide a deeper analysis."
