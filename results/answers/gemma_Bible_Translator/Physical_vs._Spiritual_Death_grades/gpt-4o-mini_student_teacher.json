  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured approach to differentiate between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish'. They effectively addressed the concern by considering biblical context, figurative language, theological interpretations, author's intent, and provided relevant examples. However, the student could enhance their answer by explicitly connecting the distinction between physical death and spiritual perishing to the eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus, as highlighted in the reference answer."
