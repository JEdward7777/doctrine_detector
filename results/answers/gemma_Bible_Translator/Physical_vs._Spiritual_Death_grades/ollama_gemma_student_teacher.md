**Differentiating between Physical Death and the Spiritual Meaning of 'Perish':**

**1. Context and Usage:**

* Examine the immediate context of the biblical text to determine whether the reference is to physical death or spiritual perishing.
* Consider the broader theological concepts and themes associated with the passage.


**2. Literal vs. Figurative Language:**

* Distinguish between literal descriptions of physical death and figurative language used to represent spiritual concepts like:
    * Spiritual decay
    * Loss of faith
    * Moral corruption
    * Separation from God


**3. Theological Interpretations:**

* Consult established Christian theological interpretations and commentaries to understand the spiritual meaning of 'perish' in specific contexts.
* Consider the concept of eternal judgment and the separation of the wicked from the righteous.


**4. Consider the Author's Intent:**

* Determine the author's intended audience and the purpose of the biblical text.
* Some passages may use 'perish' in a metaphorical sense to communicate spiritual ideas to a particular audience.


**5. Analogies and Metaphors:**

* Some biblical passages use analogies and metaphors to explain spiritual concepts in terms of physical death.
* Examples include:
    * "The wicked shall perish from the earth." (Psalm 37:38) - Literal death as a consequence of sin.
    * "He shall perish from the land of the living." (Isaiah 5:14) - Spiritual separation from God's presence.


**6. Consult Theological Dictionaries and Resources:**

* Utilize theological dictionaries and resources to explore different interpretations and definitions of 'perish' in Christian theology.


**Examples:**

* **Physical Death:** "For as in Adam all die in their physical bodies." (1 Corinthians 15:22)
* **Spiritual Perishing:** "If anyone loves not, he is perished already." (1 John 3:14)
