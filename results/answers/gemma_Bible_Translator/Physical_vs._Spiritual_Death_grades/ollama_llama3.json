  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response correctly identifies the distinction between physical and spiritual death as the primary concern, and provides some relevant biblical examples to illustrate the difference. It also acknowledges that \"perish\" can have eternal consequences in a spiritual context.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how to apply these principles when interpreting Scripture. For instance, it might be helpful to provide more detailed advice on how to examine the immediate context and broader theological concepts associated with a particular passage.\n\nAdditionally, while the response mentions consulting theological dictionaries and resources, it does not provide any concrete examples of how this would play out in practice. Providing specific examples or case studies could help to further illustrate the principles outlined in the response.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the distinction between physical and spiritual death, but could benefit from more detailed guidance and practical application."
