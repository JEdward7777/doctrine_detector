It effectively addresses the concern by offering detailed steps, examples, and references to aid in understanding the distinction. The suggested approach aligns well with Christian theological principles, emphasizing the eternal consequences of spiritual perishing for those who do not have faith in Jesus. Overall, this response demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic and presents a strong analytical framework for interpretation. Great job!"
