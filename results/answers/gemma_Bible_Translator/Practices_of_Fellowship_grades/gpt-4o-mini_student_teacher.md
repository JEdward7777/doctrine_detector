## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's response a 80.

While the student provided a comprehensive list of practices through which early Christians expressed their fellowship, they may have overly elaborated on each point and included some practices that were not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer. The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of how early Christians expressed fellowship, but they could have focused more on the core practices highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The additional details provided by the student, although insightful, somewhat detract from the specific focus of the question and concern at hand.
