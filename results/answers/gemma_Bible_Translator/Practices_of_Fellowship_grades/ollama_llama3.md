- This fostered a sense of community and deepened their spiritual connection.

**3. Compassionate works**

Grade: 80

The response provides a comprehensive overview of various practices that early Christians used to express their fellowship, including shared meals, worship gatherings, compassionate works, sharing possessions, forgiveness and reconciliation, mutual accountability, shared baptisms, and traveling together. While it does not explicitly mention listening to the teaching of God's Word or praying together as separate practices (as mentioned in the answer), it does touch on prayer (in the context of worship gatherings) and the importance of scripture (through reading).

The concern about recognizing the practices of fellowship helping contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other is well-addressed, highlighting the relevance of these ancient practices to modern Christian community-building.

To improve, the response could focus more explicitly on listening to God's Word and praying together as distinct practices that contributed to early Christian fellowship. Additionally, providing specific biblical examples or explanations for why these practices were important would strengthen the argument.
