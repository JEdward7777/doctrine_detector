  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive interpretation of the phrase 'call out to the Lord' in prayers, covering various aspects such as urgency, seeking guidance, worship, personal communication, faithfulness, and biblical examples. Their answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. However, the student could have focused more on the core aspect of seeking God urgently for help, trust, and dependence, as emphasized in the reference answer."
