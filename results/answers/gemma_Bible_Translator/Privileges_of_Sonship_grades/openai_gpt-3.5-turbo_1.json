It not only acknowledges the personal and intimate relationship with God but also provides a comprehensive overview of other privileges such as adoption into God's family, access to God's love, participation in God's glory, inheritance in Christ, new life in Christ, and intercession. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the depth of the relationship between believers and God within a Christian worldview context."
