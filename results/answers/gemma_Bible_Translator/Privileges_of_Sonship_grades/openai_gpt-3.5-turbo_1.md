**Adopted children of God receive several privileges mentioned in Romans 8:14-15:**

**1. Adoption into God's family:**

* The passage emphasizes that Christians are "adopted as sons and daughters through faith in Christ Jesus." (Romans 8:15)
* This means legal and familial standing as children of God with all the rights and privileges that come with it.

**2. Access to God's love:**

* God's love for his children is described as "abundant" and "immeasurable." (Romans 8:32)
* This love is unconditional and unwavering, providing a sense of security and belonging.

**3. Participation in God's glory:**

* God's children are "predestined to be conformed to the image of Christ." (Romans 8:29)
* This process involves spiritual growth and transformation, leading to participation in God's ultimate purpose.

**4. Inheritance in Christ:**

* God promises that his children will inherit "eternal life" and "glory." (Romans 8:17)
* This inheritance includes both physical and spiritual blessings.

**5. New life in Christ:**

* The Holy Spirit is given as a guarantee of the inheritance. (Romans 8:23)
* This new life in Christ brings freedom from sin and the power to live for God.

**6. Intercession:**

* God promises to hear the prayers of his children. (Romans 8:26-27)
* This privilege allows believers to confidently approach God with their needs and concerns.

**These privileges are not based on merit or performance but solely on God's unconditional love and grace.**
