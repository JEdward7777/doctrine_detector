  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched analysis of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in biblical prophecies, referencing relevant passages and offering interpretations. They correctly highlighted the themes of restoration, faithfulness, and triumph associated with this term. However, while the student covered key aspects, they could have delved deeper into the specific historical context surrounding the use of \"Daughter of Zion\" and its implications for contemporary application. Additionally, the interpretation of the term in relation to the virgin birth of Christ or the Church as God's new Israel could have been discussed in more detail. Overall, a strong effort with room for further expansion on historical context and alternative interpretations."
