  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-structured guide on discerning one's calling or purpose in line with biblical principles. The steps outlined incorporate scriptural references, self-reflection, prayer, seeking guidance from the Church, and practical examination of current involvement, all of which are fundamental aspects of discerning one's calling as a Christian. The emphasis on divine sovereignty, humility, obedience, and flexibility reflects important Christian values. However, the student could strengthen the answer by further emphasizing the importance of aligning one's calling with the overarching mission of spreading the Gospel and glorifying God. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding individuals to their purposes according to God's will would enhance the overall theological depth of the response."
