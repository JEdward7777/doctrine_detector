  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of the purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, they missed the core aspect of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, as specified in the reference answer. The student did well in incorporating various biblical examples and aspects of exhortation, but the central focus should have been on guiding believers towards righteousness and obedience to God's will. There is a solid understanding and application of a Christian worldview in the response, but the primary purpose specified in the reference should have been more explicitly addressed for a higher grade."
