## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage believers to live faithfully and obediently in light of their relationship with Christ.**

Biblical exhortation involves:

* **Urgent appeals:** Addressing immediate needs and challenges faced by believers.
* **Encouragement of perseverance:** Instilling hope and reminding believers of God's faithfulness.
* **Practical guidance:** Providing specific instructions and commands related to Christian living.
* **Moral admonition:** Challenging believers to live upright lives that reflect the values of Christ.

The New Testament contains numerous passages that exemplify exhortation, such as:

* **1 Thessalonians 5:14:** "Remind them of the gospel they heard and believed."
* **2 Timothy 4:2:** "Preach the word; be prepared in season to speak it."
* **Hebrews 10:25:** "Not neglecting the assembling of yourselves."

These passages demonstrate that exhortation is an integral part of Christian ministry, aimed at empowering believers to grow in faith, overcome challenges, and live out their beliefs in practical ways.

70.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 70.

While the student provided a detailed explanation of the purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, they missed the core aspect of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, as specified in the reference answer. The student did well in incorporating various biblical examples and aspects of exhortation, but the central focus should have been on guiding believers towards righteousness and obedience to God's will. There is a solid understanding and application of a Christian worldview in the response, but the primary purpose specified in the reference should have been more explicitly addressed for a higher grade.
