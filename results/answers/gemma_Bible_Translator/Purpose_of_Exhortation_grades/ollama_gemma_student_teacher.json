The reference answer provided suggests a more narrow focus on moral persuasion, which is only one aspect of New Testament exhortation. The response would benefit from further elaboration on the broader aim of exhortation, which is to encourage believers in their faith journey and empower them to live out their beliefs in practical ways."
