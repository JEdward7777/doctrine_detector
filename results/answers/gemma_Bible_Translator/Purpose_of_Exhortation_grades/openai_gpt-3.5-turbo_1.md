**The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage believers to live faithfully and obediently in light of their relationship with Christ.**

Biblical exhortation involves:

The New Testament contains numerous passages that exemplify exhortation, such as:

* **1 Thessalonians 5:14:** "Remind them of the gospel they heard and believed."
* **2 Timothy 4:2:** "Preach the word; be prepared in season to speak it."
