  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively elaborates on the biblical basis for exhortation in the New Testament, highlighting the importance of encouraging believers to live faithfully and obediently in light of their relationship with Christ. The mention of urgent appeals, encouragement of perseverance, practical guidance, and moral admonition aligns well with a Christian worldview. The inclusion of specific scriptural references further enhances the credibility of the argument. The only slight deduction is for not directly addressing the concern by emphasizing the aspect of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God\u2019s will, although the overall explanation still aligns with encouraging others in their faith journey."
