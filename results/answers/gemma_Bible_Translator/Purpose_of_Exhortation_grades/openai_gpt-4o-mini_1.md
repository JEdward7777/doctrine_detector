## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage believers to live faithfully and obediently in light of their relationship with Christ.**

Biblical exhortation involves:

* **Urgent appeals:** Addressing immediate needs and challenges faced by believers.
* **Encouragement of perseverance:** Instilling hope and reminding believers of God's faithfulness.
* **Practical guidance:** Providing specific instructions and commands related to Christian living.
* **Moral admonition:** Challenging believers to live upright lives that reflect the values of Christ.

The New Testament contains numerous passages that exemplify exhortation, such as:

* **1 Thessalonians 5:14:** "Remind them of the gospel they heard and believed."
* **2 Timothy 4:2:** "Preach the word; be prepared in season to speak it."
* **Hebrews 10:25:** "Not neglecting the assembling of yourselves."

These passages demonstrate that exhortation is an integral part of Christian ministry, aimed at empowering believers to grow in faith, overcome challenges, and live out their beliefs in practical ways.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively elaborates on the biblical basis for exhortation in the New Testament, highlighting the importance of encouraging believers to live faithfully and obediently in light of their relationship with Christ. The mention of urgent appeals, encouragement of perseverance, practical guidance, and moral admonition aligns well with a Christian worldview. The inclusion of specific scriptural references further enhances the credibility of the argument. The only slight deduction is for not directly addressing the concern by emphasizing the aspect of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God’s will, although the overall explanation still aligns with encouraging others in their faith journey.
