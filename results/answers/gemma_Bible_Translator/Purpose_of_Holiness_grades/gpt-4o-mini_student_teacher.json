  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated answer that covers various aspects of living a holy life as a Christian. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing obedience to God's Word, transformation through the Holy Spirit, purity of heart and actions, self-control, serving others, witnessing for Christ, sanctity of life, ongoing growth, seeking forgiveness, and dependence on God. While the answer is thorough and insightful, it could be improved by directly referencing the teacher's answer and focusing more on the specific practices and commandments that bring glory to God."
