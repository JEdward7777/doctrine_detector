Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear and concise overview of what it means to live a holy life as a Christian, highlighting key aspects such as obedience to God's Word, transformation through the Holy Spirit, and dependence on God's grace. While the response doesn't explicitly mention God's commandments or practices that bring glory to Him, these concepts are implicit in the discussion of obedience and dependence on God.

The concern about practical application is well-addressed, with a focus on how believers can live holy lives through their daily choices and actions. However, some points could be more specifically illustrated or elaborated upon, such as the role of self-control and moderation in avoiding excess and compromising moral standards.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding what it means to live a holy life as a Christian, but could benefit from more specific examples and illustrations to drive home the practical applications.
