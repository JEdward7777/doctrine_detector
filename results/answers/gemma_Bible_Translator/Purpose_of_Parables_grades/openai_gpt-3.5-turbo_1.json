It effectively addresses the concern by illustrating how Jesus used parables not only to reveal truths to his disciples but also to engage, challenge, and inspire all listeners in their faith journey. The explanation aligns well with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of understanding Jesus's teaching methods for deepening one's faith. Great job!"
