However, the answer given does not fully align with the Christian worldview as it focuses solely on moral truths and the distinction between disciples and unbelievers, without acknowledging the broader implications of Jesus' teaching methods for all listeners. It would have been more impactful to explicitly connect the response to the Christian understanding of faith and the transformative power of Jesus' parables for all people."
