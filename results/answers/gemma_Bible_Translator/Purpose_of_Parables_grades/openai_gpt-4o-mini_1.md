Comment: The response provides a comprehensive exploration of the purposes of Jesus using parables, emphasizing their role in simplifying complex spiritual truths, engaging listeners, revealing spiritual realities, challenging assumptions, and illustrating God's love and compassion. However, the answer given does not fully align with the Christian worldview as it focuses solely on moral truths and the distinction between disciples and unbelievers, without acknowledging the broader implications of Jesus' teaching methods for all listeners. It would have been more impactful to explicitly connect the response to the Christian understanding of faith and the transformative power of Jesus' parables for all people.
