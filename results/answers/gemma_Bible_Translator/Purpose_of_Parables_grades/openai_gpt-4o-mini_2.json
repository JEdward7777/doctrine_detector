The response effectively addressed the concern regarding understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith. However, the response could have further connected these purposes with the given answer that Jesus used parables to reveal truths to his disciples while hiding them from unbelievers. Overall, a strong understanding of the subject matter is demonstrated."
