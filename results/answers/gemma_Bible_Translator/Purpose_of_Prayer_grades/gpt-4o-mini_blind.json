  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive overview of the key purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of communication with God, worship, petition, obedience, transformation, strengthening others, and accessing God's power through prayer. The references to relevant Bible verses add depth and support to each point. However, to enhance the answer further, the student could have included more scriptural references to strengthen the connections between each purpose and biblical examples. Overall, a solid and well-articulated response."
