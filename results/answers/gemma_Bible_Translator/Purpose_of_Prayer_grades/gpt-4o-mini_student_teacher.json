  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer outlining various key purposes of prayer as mentioned in the Bible. Their response aligns with a Christian worldview by emphasizing communication with God, worship, petition, obedience, transformation, strengthening others, and accessing God's power through prayer. While the teacher's reference answer focused on specific aspects of prayer, the student's answer goes into more depth and covers a wider range of purposes. Great job overall, but some key points from the teacher's reference could have been incorporated for a more complete answer."
