However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning additional aspects such as communication with God, worship and praise, obedience and submission, transformation and growth, and accessing God's power as outlined in the Bible. By recognizing the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life, the response could have been more comprehensive and aligned with a Christian worldview."
