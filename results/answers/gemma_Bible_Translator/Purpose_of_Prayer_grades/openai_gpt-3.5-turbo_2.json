However, it falls short in fully recognizing the multifaceted role of prayer as outlined in the Bible. The Bible also emphasizes communication with God, worship and praise, obedience and submission, transformation and growth, strengthening and encouraging others, and accessing God's power through prayer, which were not all explicitly addressed in the response. Integrating these additional aspects would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the significance of prayer in a believer's life from a Christian worldview."
