It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the historical context and purpose of worship through Psalms. The response could be slightly improved by directly connecting the specific functions of the Psalms outlined with how they contribute to the understanding of worship practices in Israel. Overall, a strong and well-rounded analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
