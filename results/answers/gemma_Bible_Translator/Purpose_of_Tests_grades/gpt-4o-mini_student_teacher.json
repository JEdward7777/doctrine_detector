  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer is comprehensive and well-supported with biblical references and explanations. They appropriately address various purposes of tests that believers experience, such as deepening faith, refining character, developing perseverance, cultivating humility, and revealing God's character. They also provide examples from the Bible to illustrate their points effectively. However, the main concern is that the student's response may place slightly more emphasis on the positive outcomes of tests (faith, perseverance, etc.) rather than on the key purpose of exposing sin, helping believers turn away from sin, and drawing closer to God, as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
