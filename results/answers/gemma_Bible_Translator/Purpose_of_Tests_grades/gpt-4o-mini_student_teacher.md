* Tests expose areas of pride, selfishness, or lack of faith.
* They force us to confront our sinfulness and seek God's forgiveness.
* Through trials, God molds us into the image of Christ.

**3. To develop perseverance:**

* Tests teach us to endure hardship with patience and trust in God's sovereignty.
* They show us the importance of living for eternity, where there will be no more suffering.

**4. To cultivate humility:**

* Tests remind us that we are dependent on God for everything we have and need.
* They help us to prioritize God's will above our own desires.

**5. To reveal God's character:**

Grade: 90

Comment: The student's answer is comprehensive and well-supported with biblical references and explanations. They appropriately address various purposes of tests that believers experience, such as deepening faith, refining character, developing perseverance, cultivating humility, and revealing God's character. They also provide examples from the Bible to illustrate their points effectively. However, the main concern is that the student's response may place slightly more emphasis on the positive outcomes of tests (faith, perseverance, etc.) rather than on the key purpose of exposing sin, helping believers turn away from sin, and drawing closer to God, as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview.
