The examples from the Bible further support the points made. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern regarding how understanding the nature of tests can impact a believer's response to difficult circumstances. An even deeper exploration into how this understanding influences believers' attitudes and behaviors during trials would have enhanced the response."
