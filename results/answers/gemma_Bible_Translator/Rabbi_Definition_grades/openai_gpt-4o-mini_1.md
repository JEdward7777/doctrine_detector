## Question [Rabbi Definition](../../../questions/Rabbi_Definition.md)
What does the term 'Rabbi' mean in the context of Christian teaching?

## Correct Answer
The term 'Rabbi' literally means 'my master' or 'my teacher' and refers to a Jewish religious teacher, particularly one who teaches God's laws.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament.

## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The term 'Rabbi' does not have a direct equivalent in Christian teaching. It is primarily a title used in Judaism to denote an esteemed spiritual teacher or leader who has undergone extensive theological and ethical training.

However, Christians can learn from the teachings of Rabbi Jesus Christ, who is considered the greatest Rabbi and the Son of God in Christianity. His teachings are recorded in the Bible and provide guidance on spiritual growth, morality, and a relationship with God.
