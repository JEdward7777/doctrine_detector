The writer correctly connects the idea of Jesus paying the price for human sins to the ancient Israelite practice of redeeming people from slavery or debt. However, the response could be improved by providing more specific and detailed comparisons between biblical and ancient Israeli redemption. Additionally, while the analogy is a nice touch, it could be further developed to drive home the point about the nature and purpose of Christian redemption.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* Clear understanding of the concept of redemption in the Bible\n* Correct connection to ancient Israelite practices\n* Good attempt at using an analogy to illustrate the point\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* Limited scope of comparison between biblical and ancient Israeli redemption\n* No detailed analysis or supporting evidence from Scripture\n* Opportunity to further develop the analogy for greater impact"
