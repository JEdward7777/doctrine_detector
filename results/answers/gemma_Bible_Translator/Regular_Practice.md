## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. While Paul clearly recognized the importance of commemorating Christ's sacrifice, his instructions regarding this practice primarily focused on its observance on the night before his crucifixion (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).

The early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions. It was not until centuries later that the frequency of its observance became a matter of debate and interpretation among different Christian denominations.
