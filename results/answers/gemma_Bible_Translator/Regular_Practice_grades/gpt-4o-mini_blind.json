The statement that the early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions is not accurate. The frequency of its observance as a regular practice can be seen in Acts 20:7 where believers gathered on the first day of the week to break bread. A clearer understanding of the biblical basis for the establishment of the Lord's Supper by Paul would have improved the answer."
