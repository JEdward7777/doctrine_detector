## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. While Paul clearly recognized the importance of commemorating Christ's sacrifice, his instructions regarding this practice primarily focused on its observance on the night before his crucifixion (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).

The early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions. It was not until centuries later that the frequency of its observance became a matter of debate and interpretation among different Christian denominations.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student correctly acknowledges Paul's recognition of the importance of the Lord's Supper but misses the key point that Paul did indeed establish it as a regular practice for believers. The statement that the early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions is not accurate. The frequency of its observance as a regular practice can be seen in Acts 20:7 where believers gathered on the first day of the week to break bread. A clearer understanding of the biblical basis for the establishment of the Lord's Supper by Paul would have improved the answer.
