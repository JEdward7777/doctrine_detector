  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer does not align with the Christian worldview as it incorrectly states that the apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. The correct Christian perspective emphasizes the significance of the Lord's Supper in remembering Christ's sacrifice and proclaiming His death and resurrection. The student's response lacks this foundational understanding and therefore receives a lower grade."
