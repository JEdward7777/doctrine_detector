## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. While Paul clearly recognized the importance of commemorating Christ's sacrifice, his instructions regarding this practice primarily focused on its observance on the night before his crucifixion (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).

The early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions. It was not until centuries later that the frequency of its observance became a matter of debate and interpretation among different Christian denominations.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student's answer does not align with the Christian worldview as it incorrectly states that the apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. The correct Christian perspective emphasizes the significance of the Lord's Supper in remembering Christ's sacrifice and proclaiming His death and resurrection. The student's response lacks this foundational understanding and therefore receives a lower grade.
