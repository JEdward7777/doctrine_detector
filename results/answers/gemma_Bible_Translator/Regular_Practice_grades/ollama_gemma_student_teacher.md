## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. While Paul clearly recognized the importance of commemorating Christ's sacrifice, his instructions regarding this practice primarily focused on its observance on the night before his crucifixion (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).

The early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions. It was not until centuries later that the frequency of its observance became a matter of debate and interpretation among different Christian denominations.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 75

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the historical development and biblical basis for the Lord's Supper. However, it lacks clarity in addressing the specific concern related to Paul establishing the practice as a regular occurrence. The reference to the early church's practice on Pentecost and other special occasions provides supporting evidence but could be elaborated further to address the frequency of observance in early Christian communities.
