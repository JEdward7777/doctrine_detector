  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern by recognizing that Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice, but it does not accurately reflect the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. While it is true that Paul's instructions focused on its observance at a specific point in time, this does not mean that he did not establish it as a significant practice for believers. The response also mistakenly suggests that the early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on special occasions, when in fact Pentecost and other events were likely exceptions rather than the norm. Overall, the response shows some understanding of the issue but fails to convey the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian life.\n\nNote: The grade is 40 because the response partially addresses the concern by mentioning Paul's instructions and the early church's practice, but it does not accurately reflect the importance of the Lord's Supper or correctly describe the early church's observance."
