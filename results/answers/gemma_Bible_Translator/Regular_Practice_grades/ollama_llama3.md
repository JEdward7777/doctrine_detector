## Question [Regular Practice](../../../questions/Regular_Practice.md)
Why did the apostle Paul establish the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers?

## Correct Answer
The apostle Paul established the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers to remember and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of the Lord’s Supper in the life of the church and individual believers.

## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. While Paul clearly recognized the importance of commemorating Christ's sacrifice, his instructions regarding this practice primarily focused on its observance on the night before his crucifixion (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).

The early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions. It was not until centuries later that the frequency of its observance became a matter of debate and interpretation among different Christian denominations.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
40.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The response partially addresses the concern by recognizing that Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice, but it does not accurately reflect the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. While it is true that Paul's instructions focused on its observance at a specific point in time, this does not mean that he did not establish it as a significant practice for believers. The response also mistakenly suggests that the early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on special occasions, when in fact Pentecost and other events were likely exceptions rather than the norm. Overall, the response shows some understanding of the issue but fails to convey the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian life.

Note: The grade is 40 because the response partially addresses the concern by mentioning Paul's instructions and the early church's practice, but it does not accurately reflect the importance of the Lord's Supper or correctly describe the early church's observance.
