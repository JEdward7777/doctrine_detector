## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. While Paul clearly recognized the importance of commemorating Christ's sacrifice, his instructions regarding this practice primarily focused on its observance on the night before his crucifixion (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).

The early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions. It was not until centuries later that the frequency of its observance became a matter of debate and interpretation among different Christian denominations.

40.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
I would grade the provided response a 40. 

The response wrongly states that the apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. This contradicts the Christian belief that Paul indeed did establish the practice of the Lord's Supper. The response also inaccurately claims that it was not until centuries later that the frequency of observance became a matter of debate among denominations, which overlooks the early church practices as recorded in the New Testament.

It is important to recognize the Lord's Supper as a central and significant practice for Christians, as it serves as a remembrance and proclamation of Christ's sacrifice and resurrection, as instructed by Jesus Himself and reinforced by Paul and the early church.

Therefore, the grade is low due to the inaccurate statements that go against Christian beliefs and practices.
