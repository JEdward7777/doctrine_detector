## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. While Paul clearly recognized the importance of commemorating Christ's sacrifice, his instructions regarding this practice primarily focused on its observance on the night before his crucifixion (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).

The early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions. It was not until centuries later that the frequency of its observance became a matter of debate and interpretation among different Christian denominations.

40.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
I would grade this response as 40.

While the student correctly emphasizes the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers, their assertion about the establishment of the Lord's Supper by the apostle Paul is not consistent with Christian beliefs. According to Christian doctrine, Jesus Christ established the Lord's Supper during the Last Supper before His crucifixion as a way for believers to remember His sacrifice and proclaim His death and resurrection. The response given in the student's evaluation lacks precision in aligning with this fundamental belief, hence the lower grade.
