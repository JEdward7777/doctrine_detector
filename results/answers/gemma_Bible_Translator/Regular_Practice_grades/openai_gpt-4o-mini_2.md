## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. While Paul clearly recognized the importance of commemorating Christ's sacrifice, his instructions regarding this practice primarily focused on its observance on the night before his crucifixion (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).

The early church primarily practiced the Lord's Supper on the day of Pentecost and on other special occasions. It was not until centuries later that the frequency of its observance became a matter of debate and interpretation among different Christian denominations.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student's response correctly highlights the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers but inaccurately suggests that the apostle Paul did not establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. From a Christian worldview, it is important to recognize that Paul did indeed establish the practice of the Lord's Supper for believers to commemorate Christ's sacrifice regularly. The response shows a misunderstanding of the biblical account and historical practices regarding the Lord's Supper.
