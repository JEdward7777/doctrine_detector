## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Propitiation and atonement are closely related concepts in Christian theology, but they have distinct nuances.**

**Propitiation:**

* Means "to satisfy the wrath of God" or "to appease God's anger."
* Focuses on the action of Jesus Christ in offering himself as a sacrifice to appease God's justice and reconcile us to him.
* Highlights the divine initiative in restoring relationship with God.

**Atonement:**

* Means "to make reconciliation or peace between two parties."
* Emphasizes the need for reconciliation between God and humanity.
* Highlights the shared responsibility of both parties to restore the relationship.

**Propitiation is a foundational element of atonement.** Jesus' sacrifice on the cross satisfied the divine justice that was owed by humanity for our sins. This act of propitiation enables reconciliation between God and humanity.

**However, atonement involves more than just propitiation.** It also involves:

* **Reconciliation:** God's grace and mercy extend to us, offering forgiveness and peace.
* **Restoration:** God's healing power restores us to wholeness.
* **Redemption:** God's love transforms us, making us new creations.

**Therefore, atonement is a broader concept that encompasses both propitiation and the multifaceted process of reconciliation, restoration, and redemption.**
