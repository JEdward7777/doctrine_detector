The distinctions and nuances between the two concepts were clearly articulated, and the student effectively conveyed how propitiation is a foundational element within the broader concept of atonement. The response demonstrated a solid understanding of Christian doctrine and effectively conveyed the significance of these theological terms. Great job!"
