  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God, supported by relevant biblical references. The explanation of how repentance softens God's wrath and how repentance can be a response to God's wrath is well articulated. The conclusion regarding the necessity of both genuine repentance and God's wrath for salvation is also on point. However, to enhance the response, it could delve deeper into the theological significance of God's wrath in the context of repentance, and perhaps include more Old Testament references to provide a comprehensive view. Overall, a solid response with room for further theological exploration."
