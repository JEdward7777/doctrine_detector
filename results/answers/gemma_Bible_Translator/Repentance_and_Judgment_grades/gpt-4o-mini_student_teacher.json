  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response effectively outlines the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God, providing relevant Bible verses and explanations. They correctly emphasize the importance of repentance in softening God's wrath and highlight the necessity of both repentance and God's wrath for salvation. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly linking repentance as a crucial step in avoiding God's judgment and receiving His mercy, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated in the response."
