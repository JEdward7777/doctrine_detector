Comment: The student correctly acknowledges the lack of specific information in the biblical record regarding the replacement of Judas Iscariot. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to remember that Matthias was chosen by the early Church to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, as recorded in Acts 1:23-26. It is crucial to integrate all available biblical and historical information when addressing theological questions.
