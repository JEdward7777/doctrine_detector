Grade: 50

Comment: The student correctly identified the lack of specific information in the biblical record regarding the replacement of Judas Iscariot. However, from a Christian perspective, it is essential to recognize the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. Matthias was indeed selected to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, as mentioned in the Book of Acts. The student could have elaborated on the concept of apostolic succession and the significance of maintaining leadership within the early Christian community.
