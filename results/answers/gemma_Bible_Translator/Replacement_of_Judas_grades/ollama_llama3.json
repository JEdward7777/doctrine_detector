  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response acknowledges that the biblical record does not provide information regarding the replacement of Judas Iscariot, which shows an attempt to operate within the constraints of the given concern (recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension). However, it does not directly address the concern or provide a theological perspective on the matter.\n\nMatthias' replacement of Judas is an important event in Christian history that speaks to the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. By simply stating that Matthias was chosen without providing any theological insights or reflections, the response falls short of fully engaging with the concern.\n\nNevertheless, the response's honesty and acknowledgment of the biblical record's silence on the matter demonstrate an understanding of the limitations of Scripture and a commitment to operating within those boundaries."
