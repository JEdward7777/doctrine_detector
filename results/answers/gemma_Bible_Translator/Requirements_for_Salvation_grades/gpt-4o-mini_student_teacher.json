  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for salvation according to the Bible, including belief in Jesus, repentance from sin, acceptance of God's forgiveness, and transformation by the Holy Spirit. However, the primary focus should be on the essential elements of repentance and belief in Jesus for salvation, as stated in the reference answer. The additional information provided by the student, though relevant and informative, slightly deviates from the core biblical requirements outlined in the reference answer."
