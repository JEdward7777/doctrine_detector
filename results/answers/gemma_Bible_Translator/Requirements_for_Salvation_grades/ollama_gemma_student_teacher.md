**2. Repentance from Sin:**

* "Repent, therefore, and be converted, for the kingdom of heaven is near." (Matthew 3:2)

**3. Acceptance of God's Forgiveness:**

* "He himself is the forgiveness of sins, and is the Son of the Most High." (Luke 1:46)
* "As for you, be forgiven of your sins through his blood." (Colossians 1:14)

**4. Transformation by the Holy Spirit:**

* "I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, who will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you." (John 14:26)
* "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control." (Galatians 5:22)
