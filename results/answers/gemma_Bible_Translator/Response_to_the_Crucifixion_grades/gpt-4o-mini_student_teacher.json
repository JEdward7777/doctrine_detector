  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 50/100.\n\nWhile the student correctly indicates that there is no explicit mention in the biblical record of Peter directly addressing the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion, the response falls short of incorporating knowledge from the Christian worldview perspective and the specific concern provided. The student missed the opportunity to apply understanding of early church preaching and the call to respond to the gospel, which is crucial in this context. To improve the grade, the student should have at least attempted to analyze how Peter's message to the crowd reflects the Christian belief in repentance and faith in response to the gospel."
