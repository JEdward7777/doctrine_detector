## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly points out that the biblical record does not explicitly state that Peter addressed the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. However, it demonstrates a lack of awareness of the broader narrative surrounding Peter's preaching and the early church's response to the gospel. The answer could have benefited from further elaboration on Peter's broader teachings and their implications for understanding the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ from a Christian perspective.
