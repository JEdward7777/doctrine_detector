  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response accurately defines the term \"resurrection\" in a Christian context, highlighting Jesus' physical resurrection as a historical event that is central to Christian belief. The supporting biblical references and theological significance sections provide additional depth and context for understanding the concept of resurrection. The summary statement effectively distills the main point: that the resurrection refers to the physical rising from the dead, offering victory over sin and death, eternal life, and new life in Christ.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is in its clarity and concision. Some sections, such as \"Biblical References\" and \"Theological Significance,\" are quite detailed and might benefit from more concise language. Additionally, the \"Interpretation\" section could be rephrased to make it clearer that the resurrection is not just a symbolic event, but rather a literal one based on eyewitness accounts.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of resurrection in a Christian context and effectively addresses the concern about comprehension of life after death."
