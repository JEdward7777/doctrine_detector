  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a clear explanation of Luke 6:37 and its implications for how we should approach judging others, especially in light of condemnation. The student successfully outlines the context of the verse, the principle of judging, and the biblical approach to addressing wrongdoing. The emphasis on humility, forgiveness, and restorative justice aligns well with Christian teachings. However, the response could be enhanced by providing more direct connections to the concept of condemnation and how it relates to the teaching of Jesus in this context. Additionally, further integration of scriptural references and theological depth could strengthen the analysis."
