The inclusion of specific roles such as protection, warfare, worship, and ministry to believers, supported by relevant Bible verses, demonstrates a strong understanding of angels' functions in Christian belief. The concern regarding how Christians perceive divine intervention is also addressed effectively through the comprehensive exploration of angelic roles. Overall, this response shows a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on angelic ministry. Great work!"
