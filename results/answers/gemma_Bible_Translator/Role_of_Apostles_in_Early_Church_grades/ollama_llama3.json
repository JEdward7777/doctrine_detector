  "grade_comment": "I'm grading this response!\n\n**Grade:** 85%\n\n**Comment:** This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the apostles' approaches to community building, teaching, and leadership. The writer effectively summarizes the key elements that contributed to the growth and unity of the early church, including their emphasis on authentic relationships, accessible teaching, community involvement, modeling compassion and forgiveness, decentralized leadership, flexibility, and relationship-building.\n\nWhile the response is not exhaustive in its coverage of the apostles' actions, it provides a clear and concise overview of the main principles that guided their ministry. The writer's focus on the importance of these principles in building a strong Christian community is also well-articulated.\n\nTo improve this response further, consider adding more specific examples or anecdotes from the apostles' lives to illustrate each principle. This would help to make the connection between the apostles' actions and modern church life even clearer. Nonetheless, this response demonstrates a strong foundation in understanding community and teaching as integral aspects of church life as modeled by the apostles."
