  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively expands on the initial answer by elaborating on specific lessons derived from the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community. The points made are well-supported with relevant biblical references and insights. The writer demonstrates a strong understanding of how community and teaching are integral aspects of church life, in line with the apostles' model. The only slight room for improvement could be in further connecting these lessons directly to the importance of community and teaching in the early church."
