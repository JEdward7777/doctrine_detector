  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the various aspects of fulfilling roles within the Church from a Christian perspective. The emphasis on discipleship, spiritual gifts, ministry, leadership, unity, personal growth, evangelism, social responsibility, and obedience to God's will is commendable. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the student could have included more direct references to biblical passages that support the points made. Additionally, further elaboration on the importance of prayer, the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding individuals in their appointed roles, and the significance of humility and servant leadership within the Church would have strengthened the answer."
