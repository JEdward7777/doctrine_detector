It effectively connects the symbolism of the blood of the lamb to concepts of covenant, sacrifice, forgiveness, and faithfulness, and ultimately ties it to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. The response effectively addresses the concern about the importance of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith."
