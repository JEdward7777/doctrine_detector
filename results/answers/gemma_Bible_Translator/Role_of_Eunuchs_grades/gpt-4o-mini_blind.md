## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While it is important to uphold traditional theological beliefs, the student missed an opportunity to engage with the question through a Christian worldview. They could have discussed biblical principles relating to individuals in society, such as value, purpose, and inclusion. Encouraging them to explore connections between historical roles and God's overarching plan would have been more beneficial in addressing the question.
