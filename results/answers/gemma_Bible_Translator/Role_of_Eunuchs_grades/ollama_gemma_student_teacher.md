## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's response acknowledges the limitations of their abilities to speculate or offer theological interpretations, which demonstrates a respectful and cautious approach to the topic. However, it could have elaborated on the ways in which God's plan can utilize individuals from diverse backgrounds and circumstances, including eunuchs. The response aligns partially with the teacher's reference answer by suggesting that God can use anyone, regardless of physical state, but it lacks elaboration on the specific role of eunuchs in fulfilling God's purposes.
