Grade: 90

Comment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern by recognizing the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, regardless of their physical or social status. The acknowledgment that God can use anyone, including eunuchs, to fulfill His purposes aligns well with the Christian worldview of the inherent worth of every individual in God's eyes. The response effectively ties the example of eunuchs to the broader theological concept of God's sovereignty and inclusive nature.
