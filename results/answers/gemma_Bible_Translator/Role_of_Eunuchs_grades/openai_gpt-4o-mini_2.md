Comment: The response effectively highlights the important theological principle of God's ability to use anyone for His purposes, regardless of their physical state. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the value and purpose of individuals in God's kingdom, emphasizing equality and significance in God's eyes. The only slight deduction is due to the initial statement expressing limitations in providing theological interpretations, which could potentially hinder a more in-depth exploration of the theological implications in the response.
