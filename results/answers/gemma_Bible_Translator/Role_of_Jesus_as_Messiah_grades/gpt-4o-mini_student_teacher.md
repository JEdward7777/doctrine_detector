## [Answer](../Role_of_Jesus_as_Messiah.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The kingdom of God is central to Jesus' role as the Messiah.** The New Testament reveals that Jesus is the fulfillment of prophecies that foretold the coming of a Messiah who would establish God's kingdom on earth.

**Biblical understanding:**

* The kingdom of God is God's rule in the hearts of people and in the physical world. 
* It is a spiritual reality that has already begun in the hearts of believers, and it will eventually culminate in a physical manifestation when Jesus returns.
* Jesus' kingdom is characterized by love, justice, and forgiveness. 

**Relationship to Jesus' Messianic role:**

* **Inauguration:** Jesus' first coming announced the inauguration of God's kingdom. Through his ministry, he demonstrated the power and authority of the kingdom through his teachings, miracles, and death.
* **Victory:** His resurrection and ascension symbolized the ultimate victory of the kingdom over sin and death.
* **Return:** He will physically return to establish the kingdom in its fullness. 
* **Rule:** Jesus will reign as King of kings and Lord of lords, bringing peace, righteousness, and fulfillment to all creation.

**Implications:**

* The kingdom of God is not merely a future event but has implications for the present. 
* Believers are called to participate in the expansion of the kingdom through their witness, service, and prayer.
* The kingdom of God is a source of hope and purpose for those who follow Jesus Christ.

**Additional considerations:**

* The kingdom of God is not limited to any specific political or social system. 
* It transcends human boundaries and encompasses the totality of God's redemptive work in both the spiritual and physical realms.
