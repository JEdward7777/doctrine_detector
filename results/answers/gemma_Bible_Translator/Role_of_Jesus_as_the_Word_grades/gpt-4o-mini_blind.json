The answer effectively covers various aspects such as divine revelation, incarnation, mediation, perfect revelation, divine authority, unity with the Bible, and fulfillment of prophecy. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of this theological concept and effectively supports their points with relevant scriptural references. Well done!"
