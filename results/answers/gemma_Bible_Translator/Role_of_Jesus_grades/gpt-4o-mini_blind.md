## [Answer](../Role_of_Jesus.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The Bible describes the pivotal role of Jesus Christ in our salvation in several ways:**

**1. Son of God and Savior:**

* Jesus is declared the Son of God, born of the Virgin Mary by the Holy Spirit (Matthew 1:18, 23:39).
* He is called the Savior who rescues people from their sins (Luke 1:47).

**2. Atoning Sacrifice:**

* Jesus' death on the cross is seen as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of humanity (1 Peter 2:24).
* His shed blood covers the sins of believers, making them righteous before God (Romans 5:8-9).

**3. Resurrection and Redemption:**

* Jesus rose from the dead on the third day, demonstrating his power over sin and death (1 Corinthians 15:20).
* His resurrection offers hope and redemption to believers, who will be resurrected at the final judgment (John 5:24).

**4. Intermediary Between God and Man:**

* Jesus serves as an intermediary between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5).
* He intercedes for believers before the Father (Hebrews 7:25).

**5. Advocate and High Priest:**

* Jesus is our Advocate, who pleads for us in heaven (Romans 8:34).
* He is also our High Priest, who offers prayers and sacrifices for us (Hebrews 8:1).

**6. New Life and Reconciliation:**

* Jesus offers new life in him, transforming the hearts and lives of believers (2 Corinthians 5:17).
* He reconciles us to God, bridging the gap between us and the Father (Colossians 1:20).

**These truths are central to Christian theology and are foundational to the Christian faith.**
