However, from a Christian worldview, it is essential to emphasize the theological aspect of Jesus' crucifixion, particularly the belief that Jesus willingly laid down His life as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of humanity. While the influence of political and religious factors is acknowledged, the central Christian belief in the redemptive purpose of Jesus' crucifixion should have been highlighted more explicitly in the response."
