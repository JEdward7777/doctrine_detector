They effectively highlighted key aspects such as illustrating David's sinfulness, exposing his hardness of heart, communicating God's judgment, and offering a way of reconciliation. However, the student's response could be improved by focusing more on the central theme of revealing David's sin for acknowledgment and repentance, as mentioned in the reference answer. Emphasizing this main point would align the analysis more closely with the Christian worldview of correction and revelation through parables in biblical narratives."
