## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The prophet Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David by:

**1. Illustrating David's sinfulness:**
- The parable highlighted the injustice of David withholding a lamb from its rightful owner, paralleling David's sin of adultery with Bathsheba.
- The lamb represented God's rightful claim on David's life and his responsibility to uphold justice.

**2. Exposing David's hardness of heart:**
- By comparing David to a wealthy man who could afford to spare the lamb, Nathan revealed David's indifference and callousness towards God's law.
- This confrontation helped David acknowledge the gravity of his sin.

**3. Communicating God's judgment:**
- The parable foreshadowed the coming judgment upon David for his sin, which would ultimately result in the loss of his dynasty.
- This consequence was a direct consequence of David's actions and his violation of God's law.

**4. Offering a way of reconciliation:**
- Although the parable established God's judgment, it also hinted at the possibility of forgiveness and reconciliation.
- By acknowledging David's remorse and offering the lamb as a sacrifice, Nathan hinted at the potential for forgiveness and restoration.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how the prophet Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David. They effectively highlighted key aspects such as illustrating David's sinfulness, exposing his hardness of heart, communicating God's judgment, and offering a way of reconciliation. However, the student's response could be improved by focusing more on the central theme of revealing David's sin for acknowledgment and repentance, as mentioned in the reference answer. Emphasizing this main point would align the analysis more closely with the Christian worldview of correction and revelation through parables in biblical narratives.
