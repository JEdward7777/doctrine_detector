  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of how Nathan's parable was used to confront David, highlighting the prophet's use of storytelling to illustrate God's law, expose David's hardness of heart, communicate God's judgment, and offer a way of reconciliation. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical narrative and the role of parables in biblical storytelling.\n\nHowever, while the response provides a thorough analysis of Nathan's parable, it could be improved by more explicitly connecting the use of parables to the broader concern about understanding their role in biblical narratives. Additionally, some of the points made could be more nuanced or expanded upon to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nOverall, I would give this response an A- (85%) for its thoughtful and well-supported analysis of Nathan's parable and its relevance to the concern about understanding the use of parables in biblical narratives."
