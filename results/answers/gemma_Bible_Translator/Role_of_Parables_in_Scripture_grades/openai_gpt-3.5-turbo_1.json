The analysis provided offers deep insights into the purpose and impact of the parable used by Nathan, highlighting key aspects such as illustrating David's sinfulness, exposing his hardness of heart, communicating God's judgment, and offering a pathway to reconciliation. The integration of Christian worldview perspectives enriches the evaluation of the parable's significance in the biblical narrative. Great job!"
