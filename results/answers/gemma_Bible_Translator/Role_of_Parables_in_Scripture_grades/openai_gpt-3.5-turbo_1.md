# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The prophet Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David by:

**1. Illustrating David's sinfulness:**
- The parable highlighted the injustice of David withholding a lamb from its rightful owner, paralleling David's sin of adultery with Bathsheba.
- The lamb represented God's rightful claim on David's life and his responsibility to uphold justice.

**2. Exposing David's hardness of heart:**
- By comparing David to a wealthy man who could afford to spare the lamb, Nathan revealed David's indifference and callousness towards God's law.
- This confrontation helped David acknowledge the gravity of his sin.

**3. Communicating God's judgment:**
- The parable foreshadowed the coming judgment upon David for his sin, which would ultimately result in the loss of his dynasty.
- This consequence was a direct consequence of David's actions and his violation of God's law.

**4. Offering a way of reconciliation:**
- Although the parable established God's judgment, it also hinted at the possibility of forgiveness and reconciliation.
- By acknowledging David's remorse and offering the lamb as a sacrifice, Nathan hinted at the potential for forgiveness and restoration.
