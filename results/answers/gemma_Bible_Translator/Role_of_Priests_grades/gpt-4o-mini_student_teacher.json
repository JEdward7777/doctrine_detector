They have accurately highlighted the sacrificial priesthood, mediation and intercession, purity and sacrifice, teaching and instruction, and administration and leadership roles of priests. However, the student's answer goes beyond the given reference answer by providing additional details and explanations. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical role of priests, which is commendable."
