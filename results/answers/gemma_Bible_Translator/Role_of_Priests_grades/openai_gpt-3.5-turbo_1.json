However, the response lacks depth in explaining the full scope of the role of priests as outlined in the Old Testament. It does not address the concepts of mediation, purity, administration, leadership, and the significance of sacrifices in relation to atonement and God's covenant with the people. A more comprehensive understanding of the biblical role of priests would enhance the response."
