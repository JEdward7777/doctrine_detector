The student effectively covers the key aspects such as communicating God's will, revealing God's character, confronting wrongdoing, interceding for God's people, and providing encouragement and hope. The key characteristics of a prophet are also appropriately highlighted. The answer is doctrinally sound and demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical role of a prophet. Great work!"
