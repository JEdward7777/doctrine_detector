## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's answer as 75.

While the student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated understanding of the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible with multiple dimensions and detailed explanations, they have expanded beyond the reference answer provided by the teacher. Although the additional information showcases a deep understanding of the topic, the answer diverges from the more concise focus of the reference answer, which is to speak God's messages to the people, particularly warning them to turn from sin and obey God. 

The student's response demonstrates a thorough grasp of the biblical role of prophets and their messages, with additional insights that align with Christian perspectives. However, staying closer to the reference answer while enhancing it with explanations could lead to a more cohesive response.
