  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 70.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that prophets speak God's message to the people, which is a crucial aspect of their role. It also mentions warning people to turn away from their sins and obey God, which indicates some understanding of the prophetic call to confront and correct wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, the response seems to oversimplify the biblical role of prophets. It doesn't touch on the other important aspects of prophecy listed in the original text, such as revealing God's character and purposes, interceding for God's people, or providing encouragement and hope. The concern is understanding the biblical role of prophets and their messages, but this response only scratches the surface.\n\nTo receive a higher score, the response could have provided more detail on the various aspects of prophetic ministry mentioned in the original text, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the biblical concept of prophecy."
