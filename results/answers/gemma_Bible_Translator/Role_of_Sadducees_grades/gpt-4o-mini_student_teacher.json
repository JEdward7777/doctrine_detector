However, the answer strayed slightly from the given reference answer, particularly in discussing the Sadducees' rejection of beliefs in the afterlife, angels, and spirits. While this additional context is informative, it could have been more closely tied to the main responsibilities within the temple system as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, a solid response with additional details that could have been more directly aligned with the specific historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus."
