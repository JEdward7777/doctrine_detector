  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response expands on the responsibilities of scribes beyond just copying and preserving the Old Testament Scriptures, delving into areas such as authorship attestation, theological integrity, historical context, and canonicity. While these additional points demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the significance of the scribes' role, the primary focus on accurate copying and transmission as highlighted in the reference answer is somewhat diluted. The student's response is thorough but could benefit from a more concise and direct alignment with the key responsibility of scribes in preserving the Old Testament Scriptures."
