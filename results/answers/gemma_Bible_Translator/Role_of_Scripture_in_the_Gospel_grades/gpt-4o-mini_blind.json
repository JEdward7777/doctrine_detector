The inclusion of specific examples from the early church, Paul's missionary journeys, the Great Commission mandate, parables and illustrations from Jesus, early church writings, and the formation of Scripture is commendable. The key principles for sharing the Gospel through Scripture are also well articulated. The only area for improvement would be to connect the use of Scripture more directly to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ, which is the central focus of the Gospel. Overall, well-done."
