I would give this response a score of 20.

While the given answer does mention one aspect of the high priest's role, it only scratches the surface of their unique responsibilities in Israel's worship practices. The concern asked for understanding the significance of the high priest's role, but the provided response does not demonstrate such an understanding.

The given answer focuses on a specific ritual practice, whereas the full scope of the high priest's responsibilities is much broader and more complex. The response lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the high priest's role as described in Scripture. To better address the concern, one would need to provide a more comprehensive overview of the high priest's duties, such as those listed in the provided response.

To improve this response, I would suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the high priest's role and its significance within Israel's worship practices, rather than focusing on a single ritual practice.
