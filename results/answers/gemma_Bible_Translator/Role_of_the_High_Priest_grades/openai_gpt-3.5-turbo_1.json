This action was crucial for the atonement of the sins of the people. However, the response could be improved by expanding on the broader responsibilities and roles of the High Priest as outlined in the provided statement. Understanding the significance of the High Priest's role not only in performing sacrifices but also in maintaining purity, serving as an intermediary between God and the people, reconciling sins, providing leadership, and overseeing the priesthood is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the high priest's role in the worship practices of Israel."
