This aligns well with the broader role of the High Priest as the mediator between God and the people for reconciliation and forgiveness of sins. The response could have been enhanced by elaborating on the significance and symbolism behind this annual sacrifice, tying it back to the broader spiritual and moral responsibilities of the High Priest."
