However, they could have further elaborated by mentioning the instructions given in Exodus 16:23-26, where God specifically instructed the Israelites to gather double manna on the sixth day to prepare for the Sabbath, highlighting the importance of observing the Sabbath rest. A more thorough explanation would have earned a higher grade."
