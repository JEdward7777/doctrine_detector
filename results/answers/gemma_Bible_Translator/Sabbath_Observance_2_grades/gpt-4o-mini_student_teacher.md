## Question [Sabbath Observance 2](../../../questions/Sabbath_Observance_2.md)
How did God instruct the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath?

## Correct Answer
God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna the day before the Sabbath so they would have enough to eat on their day of rest.

## Stated Concern
Importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands.

## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The Bible does not provide any record of God instructing the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath. Manna is not mentioned in the context of the Sabbath in the Bible.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student correctly pointed out that the Bible does not provide direct instructions on gathering manna in relation to the Sabbath. However, they missed the opportunity to discuss the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands, which was the specified concern. The student could have further explained the significance of God's instruction to gather double manna before the Sabbath as a demonstration of trust in His provision and command to rest on the Sabbath day.
