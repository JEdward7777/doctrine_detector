## Question [Sabbath Observance 2](../../../questions/Sabbath_Observance_2.md)
How did God instruct the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath?

## Correct Answer
God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna the day before the Sabbath so they would have enough to eat on their day of rest.

## Stated Concern
Importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands.

## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The Bible does not provide any record of God instructing the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath. Manna is not mentioned in the context of the Sabbath in the Bible.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
95.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

The response accurately points out that the premise of the question is incorrect, which demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account. It also correctly states that manna is not mentioned in the context of the Sabbath in the Bible. The only area for improvement is that it does not explicitly state what God's commands are regarding the Sabbath, instead focusing on correcting the inaccurate premise.

Comment: This response effectively addresses the concern about observing the Sabbath according to God's commands by highlighting the importance of biblical accuracy and correcting a common misconception about the Israelites' experience with manna.
