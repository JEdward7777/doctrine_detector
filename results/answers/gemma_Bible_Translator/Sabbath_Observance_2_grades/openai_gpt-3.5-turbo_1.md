Importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands.

## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The Bible does not provide any record of God instructing the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath. Manna is not mentioned in the context of the Sabbath in the Bible.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately explains how God instructed the Israelites to gather extra manna before the Sabbath. However, the concern about the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands could have been further emphasized to demonstrate the significance of following God's instructions regarding rest and worship.
