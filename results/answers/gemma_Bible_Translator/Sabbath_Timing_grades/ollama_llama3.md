## Question [Sabbath Timing](../../../questions/Sabbath_Timing.md)
What is the timing of the Sabbath according to Jewish tradition?

## Correct Answer
The Sabbath begins on Friday at sundown and lasts until Saturday at sundown.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the specific timeframe for the observance of the Sabbath in accordance with Biblical teaching.

## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The timing of the Sabbath according to Jewish tradition is from **Friday sunset to Saturday sunset**. This encompasses the seventh day of the week, from the moment the sun dips below the horizon on Friday until it reappears on Saturday.

The Jewish tradition upholds this timing for the Sabbath observance as a sacred day of rest and worship.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response accurately describes the Jewish tradition's timing for the Sabbath, matching the specific timeframe mentioned in the answer ("Friday at sundown and lasts until Saturday at sundown"). The response also mentions the significance of the Sabbath as a sacred day of rest and worship, which is consistent with Biblical teaching.

The only deduction I would make is that the response does not explicitly reference Biblical teaching or Scripture. While it is true that the Jewish tradition's timing for the Sabbath is rooted in Scriptural guidance (e.g., Genesis 2:2-3), a more explicit connection to Biblical authority might strengthen the response.

Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the Jewish tradition's observance of the Sabbath and its significance, and it aligns well with the concern of recognizing the specific timeframe for the observance of the Sabbath in accordance with Biblical teaching.
