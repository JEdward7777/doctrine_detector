## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
60.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60. While the student acknowledges their limitation in providing interpretations or comparisons, they fail to engage with the question at all. It is important to attempt an answer even if one feels unsure, and in this case, even a brief explanation of the Nazirite vow and Samson's story without drawing direct comparisons could have been beneficial.
