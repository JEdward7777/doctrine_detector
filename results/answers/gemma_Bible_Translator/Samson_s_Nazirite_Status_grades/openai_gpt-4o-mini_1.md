Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate connection between Samson's strength and his adherence to the Nazirite vow, highlighting the significance of personal commitment to divine purpose in biblical narratives. The answer aligns well with Christian teachings on the importance of faithfully following God's commands and the resulting blessings. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly delving into the broader exploration of divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives beyond the specific example of Samson's vow.
