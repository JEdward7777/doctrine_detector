  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thorough explanation of the sanctification process for believers in Jesus according to the New Testament. They covered various aspects such as positional sanctification, progressive sanctification, sanctification through trials, sanctification through obedience, and emphasized sanctification as a continual journey. The inclusion of key New Testament passages further strengthened their answer. However, the student could have tied their response more explicitly to the reference answer provided by the teacher, emphasizing the role of God in sanctifying believers through faith in Jesus. Overall, a well-written and detailed response reflecting a solid understanding of the sanctification process in Christianity."
