## [Answer](../Sanctification_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The New Testament describes the sanctification process for believers in Jesus through:**

**1. Positional Sanctification:**

* Believers are declared "holy" by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:29).
* Justification is a one-time event that makes believers eternally holy in God's sight (Heb. 10:14).

**2. Progressive Sanctification:**

* The process of becoming more holy is called "progressive sanctification."
* This involves changing attitudes, behaviors, and actions to reflect Christ's character (2 Cor. 3:18).
* The Holy Spirit works in believers' lives to transform them (Gal. 5:22-23).

**3. Sanctification Through Trials:**

* God uses trials and temptations to refine believers and deepen their holiness (1 Peter 1:6-7).
* Overcoming these challenges leads to spiritual growth and maturity.

**4. Sanctification Through Obedience:**

* Following Christ's commands and living a life that pleases him is an integral part of sanctification (John 14:13).
* Obedience demonstrates the love believers have for God and reflects their new nature in Christ.

**5. Sanctification as a Journey:**

* The process of sanctification is an ongoing journey, not a destination.
* Believers are continually growing in Christ and becoming more like him.

**Key New Testament passages on sanctification:**

* Romans 8:29 - "For those whom he justified he also glorified."
* 1 Corinthians 1:30 - "And we are transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory."
* 2 Corinthians 3:18 - "And we all, with unveiled face, seeing the glory of the Lord as it is reflected in a mirror."
* Galatians 5:22-23 - "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control."
* 1 Peter 1:1 - "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy has given us a new birth to a living hope."

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a good overview of the New Testament's teaching on sanctification, including the concepts of positional, progressive, and trial-based sanctification. However, it does not explicitly highlight the role of faith in this process, which is the primary concern. While the passage mentioning "believing in Jesus" is a step in the right direction, it could be more thoroughly developed to show how faith plays a crucial part in sanctification.

To improve, the response could incorporate biblical passages that emphasize the importance of faith in making believers holy and setting them apart for God's purposes. For example, it could mention Ephesians 2:8-9, which says that salvation is by faith alone, or Philippians 2:12-13, which emphasizes the need to work out one's salvation with fear and trembling (i.e., through faithful living). By incorporating these passages and explicitly linking faith to sanctification, the response could receive a higher grade.
