## [Answer](../Sanctification_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The New Testament describes the sanctification process for believers in Jesus through:**

**1. Positional Sanctification:**

* Believers are declared "holy" by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:29).
* Justification is a one-time event that makes believers eternally holy in God's sight (Heb. 10:14).

**2. Progressive Sanctification:**

* The process of becoming more holy is called "progressive sanctification."
* This involves changing attitudes, behaviors, and actions to reflect Christ's character (2 Cor. 3:18).
* The Holy Spirit works in believers' lives to transform them (Gal. 5:22-23).

**3. Sanctification Through Trials:**

* God uses trials and temptations to refine believers and deepen their holiness (1 Peter 1:6-7).
* Overcoming these challenges leads to spiritual growth and maturity.

**4. Sanctification Through Obedience:**

* Following Christ's commands and living a life that pleases him is an integral part of sanctification (John 14:13).
* Obedience demonstrates the love believers have for God and reflects their new nature in Christ.

**5. Sanctification as a Journey:**

* The process of sanctification is an ongoing journey, not a destination.
* Believers are continually growing in Christ and becoming more like him.

**Key New Testament passages on sanctification:**

* Romans 8:29 - "For those whom he justified he also glorified."
* 1 Corinthians 1:30 - "And we are transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory."
* 2 Corinthians 3:18 - "And we all, with unveiled face, seeing the glory of the Lord as it is reflected in a mirror."
* Galatians 5:22-23 - "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control."
* 1 Peter 1:1 - "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy has given us a new birth to a living hope."

Comment: This response provides an excellent overview of the New Testament's teaching on sanctification, detailing both positional and progressive sanctification, sanctification through trials and obedience, and emphasizing sanctification as an ongoing journey. The inclusion of key passages further strengthens the response. However, the response could be slightly improved by directly referencing the role of faith in the sanctification process, as it is crucial in the believer's relationship with God and their growth in holiness.
