The inclusion of key New Testament passages adds depth to the explanation. It addresses the concern by highlighting the role of faith in sanctification, emphasizing how believers are made holy by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ. Overall, this is a well-rounded and faithful reflection from a Christian worldview."
