The detailed explanation of positional sanctification, progressive sanctification, sanctification through trials, obedience, and sanctification as a journey effectively addresses the concern raised. The inclusion of key New Testament passages further reinforces the biblical basis for the response. Great job in integrating the Christian perspective on sanctification with a strong focus on faith."
