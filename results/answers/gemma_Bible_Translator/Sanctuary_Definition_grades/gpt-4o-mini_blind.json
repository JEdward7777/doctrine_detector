  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"sanctuary\" in the Bible, covering both its physical and spiritual meanings with appropriate biblical references. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and effectively connects it to the broader themes of refuge and protection in a Christian worldview. The use of relevant verses enhances the depth of the response. Great job overall."
