  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 85.\n\nThe student provided a detailed and comprehensive answer that covers both the physical and spiritual aspects of the term \"sanctuary\" in the Biblical context. They accurately described how the term is used in relation to designated places of refuge in the Old Testament along with the metaphorical spiritual refuge found in God in both Old and New Testament writings. They also included relevant biblical references to support their explanation.\n\nWhile the student's response was well done and demonstrated a thorough understanding of the term \"sanctuary\" in the Bible, it slightly diverged from the teacher's reference answer by incorporating additional examples and explanations. However, the student's additional information did not deviate significantly from the core meaning of 'sanctuary' as a 'holy place' made sacred by God for protection and safety."
