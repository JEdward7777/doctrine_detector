## [Answer](../Sanctuary_Definition.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**In the Bible, the term "sanctuary" has two primary meanings:**

**1. Physical Sanctuary:**

* Refers to a designated place of refuge or safety, where individuals or objects are protected from harm, danger, or defilement.
* Examples include the Tabernacle and the Temple in the Old Testament, where God's presence was believed to reside.
* In the New Testament, the Church is often referred to as a sanctuary, as it is a safe haven for believers.

**2. Spiritual Sanctuary:**

* Represents a place of refuge for the soul in times of spiritual distress or temptation.
* This sanctuary is found in God himself, who offers peace, forgiveness, and strength to those who are struggling.
* The Psalms frequently speak of finding refuge in God's presence.

**Biblical references:**

* **Old Testament:**
    * "The Lord is my sanctuary, my refuge in times of trouble" (Psalm 9:14)
    * "He shall be my horn and my sanctuary" (Psalm 45:7)
* **New Testament:**
    * "But as he is the Son of Man, he was not seen as honorable by anyone in the world. He was despised and rejected by the rulers of this generation... But God has anointed him as Prince over his people, and his name shall be great among the nations. He is the Son of God, and he is the sanctuary" (Daniel 7:13-14)

**Therefore, the term "sanctuary" in the Bible encompasses both physical and spiritual concepts, emphasizing the idea of a safe and protective refuge in both physical and spiritual realms.**
