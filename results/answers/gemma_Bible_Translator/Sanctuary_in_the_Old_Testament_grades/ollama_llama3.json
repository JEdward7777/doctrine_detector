  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the student does acknowledge that God referred to the sanctuary as a place where He lived among His people, their understanding is limited to just two points: that it was a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people. They do not touch on the other important aspects of the sanctuary, such as its role in worship, reconciliation, representation of God's character, or community and covenant.\n\nThe concern is about recognizing the importance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God, which the student does address. However, they could have gone further to discuss its significance as a source of safety and protection, as well as its connection to God's presence among His people.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response would need to demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the sanctuary and its significance in the Old Testament, including its role in worship, reconciliation, representation of God's character, and community and covenant."
