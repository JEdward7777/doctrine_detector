The response also references relevant Old Testament passages and effectively ties them to the significance of the sanctuary. The concern about God referring to the sanctuary as a place of His dwelling among His people and a source of safety is addressed accurately and integrated cohesively within the broader discussion of the sanctuary's role. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian view of the sanctuary in the Old Testament."
