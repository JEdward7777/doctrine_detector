  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides relevant biblical verses that support intercession, which aligns with the concern to encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. The included verses from Romans 8:26-27, Hebrews 7:25, and others are indeed important passages that highlight the importance of intercession.\n\nHowever, I would have liked to see more depth and connection made between these verses and the concern. For example, how do these verses specifically encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession? How can we apply these verses in our daily lives as we seek to intercede for others?\n\nAdditionally, while the response includes several relevant Bible verses, it could have been more concise and focused in its presentation. A few of the verses listed seem slightly tangential to the topic of intercession (e.g., 1 Peter 3:12).\n\nOverall, the response is strong because it provides relevant biblical support for the importance of intercession. With a bit more attention to connecting the dots between the verses and the concern, this response could be even stronger!"
