The inclusion of specific verses, such as Hebrews 7:25 and Romans 8:26-27, along with insights drawn from them, aligns well with the concern to encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. The response could be further enhanced by adding explanations on how these verses can be practically applied in the believers' prayer lives."
