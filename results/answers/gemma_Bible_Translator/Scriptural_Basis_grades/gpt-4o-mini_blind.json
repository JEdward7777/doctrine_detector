  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response is thorough and provides a variety of Bible verses from both the Old and New Testaments that support the concept of propitiation. The verses chosen effectively illustrate how sacrifice and reconciliation are intertwined in the Christian worldview. The inclusion of additional relevant passages further enriches the answer and shows a deep understanding of the topic. Great job!"
