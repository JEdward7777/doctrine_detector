  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses supporting the concept of propitiation, both from the Old and New Testaments. They included relevant verses and explanations to connect the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding. However, the reference answer from the teacher specifically highlighted 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26 as key verses, which the student did not explicitly mention. This could have strengthened their answer and made it more aligned with the teacher's specific focus. Overall, a good effort in showcasing biblical support for the concept of propitiation."
