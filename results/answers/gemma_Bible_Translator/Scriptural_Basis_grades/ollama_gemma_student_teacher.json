  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and comprehensive response that provides thorough analysis of the concept of propitiation and its support in the Bible. The student demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological significance of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate propitiation for sins. The inclusion of relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments strengthens the argument and supports the claim that Jesus is indeed the propitiation for our sins."
