  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of Bible verses supporting the concept of propitiation, both from the Old and New Testament, offering a deep understanding of the theological concept. The connection between the theological concept and biblical references is clearly articulated, with additional relevant passages enhancing the explanation. The response effectively addresses the concern by linking the provided key verses with the broader context of propitiation in Scripture. Great job!"
