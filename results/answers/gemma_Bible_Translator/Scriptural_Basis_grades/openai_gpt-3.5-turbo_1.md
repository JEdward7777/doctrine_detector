## Bible Verses Supporting the Concept of Propitiation:

**1. Old Testament:**

* **Genesis 22:13-14:** "But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, 'Abraham! Abraham!' And he said, 'Here I am.' And he said, 'Do not lay your hand on the boy. Now I know that you fear God, for you have not withheld your son from me.' And I swear by myself that in blessing you I will bless the nations, and in cursing you I will curse the nations." - This verse demonstrates God's willingness to accept sacrifice as an act of reconciliation.
* **Psalm 23:1-2:** "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters." - This verse highlights God's provision and restoration through sacrifice.

**2. New Testament:**

* **Romans 3:23-25:** "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love for us, saved us, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but by the grace of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord." - This verse emphasizes that salvation is through Christ's sacrifice, not by human merit.
* **1 John 2:2:** "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world." - This verse clearly defines Christ as the ultimate propitiation for sins.
* **Hebrews 2:17:** "Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, except that he was without sin." - This verse highlights the importance of Jesus' human nature and sacrifice in reconciliation.
* **1 Peter 1:18-19:** "For you know that it was not with perishable things that you were redeemed, but with the precious blood of Christ, like a ransom paid to subdue the wrath of God." - This verse emphasizes the value of Christ's blood as payment for sin.

**Additional relevant passages:**

* **Isaiah 53:** This chapter paints a prophetic picture of Christ as the Suffering Servant, who would take the punishment for sin.
* **2 Corinthians 5:21:** "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God through the imputation of his righteousness."
* **Revelation 5:6:** "And I saw a Lamb standing as if it were slain... and I heard a voice from heaven like a trumpet, saying, 'Worthy is the Lamb!' for he was slain and his blood is the redemption of those who are redeemed."
