It effectively connects the theological concept with biblical references, offering a deeper understanding of how Jesus is the propitiation for our sins. The inclusion of key verses like 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26 further enhances the explanation. Overall, it is a well-researched and solid response."
