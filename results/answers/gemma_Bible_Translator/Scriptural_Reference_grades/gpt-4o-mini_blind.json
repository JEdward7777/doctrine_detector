  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid overview of biblical passages that address the concept of the \"world\" in relation to believers. The selection and explanation of verses demonstrate a good understanding of the distinction between believers and the world, as well as the call for believers to interact with and influence the world. However, a slight deduction in the grade is warranted due to a potential misunderstanding in the interpretation of 1 John 2:2, where the student suggests that Christ's propitiation is not for the sins of the world, which might benefit from clarification in line with the broader theological understanding of Christ's atonement for all humanity. Overall, a commendable effort in integrating Biblical passages with insightful interpretations."
