  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of biblical passages addressing the concept of the \"world\" in relation to believers, emphasizing the distinction between believers and the world, the call to love and influence the world, and the potential conflicts believers may face. The response effectively addresses the concern of how to navigate life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values by highlighting key passages and interpretations relevant to this challenge. Overall, a strong and well-supported analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
