  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical passages supporting the concept of the Day of Judgment from various sections of the Bible \u2013 the Prophets, the Gospels, the Epistles, and general references. The citations are relevant and accurately capture the essence of divine judgment and accountability. However, to achieve a perfect score, the student could have delved deeper into the theological significance and implications of these passages in relation to the Day of Judgment."
