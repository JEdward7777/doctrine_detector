  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical passages supporting the concept of the Day of Judgment spanning across various sections of the Bible. However, the student missed key passages referenced by the teacher. The student showed good understanding and effort in compiling relevant passages, but should have incorporated the specific references mentioned by the teacher to further enhance their answer. Overall, a solid effort towards deepening the understanding of scripture related to judgment."
