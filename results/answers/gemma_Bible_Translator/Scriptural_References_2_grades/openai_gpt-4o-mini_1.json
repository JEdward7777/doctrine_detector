  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive list of Biblical passages supporting the concept of the Day of Judgment, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment. However, the response did not directly address the specified concern of deepening the understanding of scripture related to judgment. Including an explanation or analysis of the key passages mentioned in relation to the broader discussion on judgment would have further strengthened the response."
