  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided a good list of key biblical passages supporting the concept of the Day of Judgment, which aligns well with the concern of deepening understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforcing the scriptural basis for beliefs. However, the specific passages mentioned in the given answer (Luke 10:12, Luke 11:31, Luke 11:32, Matthew 10:15, and Matthew 12:36) were not thoroughly integrated with the provided list, which could have further strengthened the response. Improving the connection between the answer and the comprehensive list of key passages would have enhanced the overall grade."
