  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response effectively incorporates the given answer into a more comprehensive analysis of Matthew 23:27-28, highlighting the multifaceted nature of iniquity. The five points presented provide a thorough examination of how sin can manifest in individuals, institutions, and religious practices. The conclusion nicely summarizes the main takeaways from the passage.\n\nWhile the response does not directly address the concern about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards, it indirectly touches on this theme by highlighting the importance of true worship and motivated hearts (points 4 and 5). Additionally, the emphasis on iniquity as a systemic problem that can corrupt individuals, institutions, and practices serves as a reminder of the need for authentic faith.\n\nTo improve this response, the author could explicitly address the concern about genuine holiness versus external compliance. They could also provide more explicit connections between the passage's teachings and the call to genuine holiness in their conclusion. Overall, however, this is a strong response that effectively engages with the given passage and its themes."
