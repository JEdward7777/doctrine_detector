  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 90. The student effectively analyzes the references to birthright in 1 Chronicles 5:1, Genesis 25:34, and Hebrews 12:14-17, drawing out key themes and implications. They discuss the privilege, inheritance, and Christological significance of the birthright in a cohesive and insightful manner. The student's points align well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. However, to further enhance their answer, they could have elaborated on the importance of holiness and the consequences of disregarding one's spiritual inheritance as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical teachings on birthright and its relevance to Christian life."
