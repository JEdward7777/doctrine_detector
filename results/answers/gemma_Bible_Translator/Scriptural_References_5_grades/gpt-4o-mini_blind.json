However, the explanation could be more focused and clearly tied back to the original question. Additionally, some of the interpretations of the verses may require further clarification in relation to the doctrinal teachings of the Christian faith. It would have been beneficial to provide more direct connections between the verses and the concept of Hades shifting into a place associated with the unrighteous. Some parts of the response, such as the section on 2 Timothy 4:18, seemed tangential to the main topic and could have been better utilized focusing on key verses indicating the shift in understanding."
