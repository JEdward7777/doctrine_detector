  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of New Testament verses indicating a shift in understanding of Hades, along with additional considerations from early Church fathers and theological developments. However, the reference answer from the teacher specifically pointed out Luke 16:23 as a key verse depicting Hades as a place for the unrighteous. The student's answer did not include this verse, so there was a slight oversight in directly addressing the concern. Nevertheless, the student demonstrated a solid understanding and interpretation of other relevant verses and aspects related to the topic."
