  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of biblical passages on fools and foolish behavior, covering general characteristics, foolish actions, consequences, and the importance of wisdom and discernment. They have also correctly emphasized seeking wisdom from God and applying biblical principles to modern life. The student's answer aligns well with the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern of remaining vigilant against foolishness. However, the student missed including some specific passages mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
