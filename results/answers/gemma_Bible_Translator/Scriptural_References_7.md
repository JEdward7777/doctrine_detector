## Exaltation in 1 Peter 5:5-7 & Philippians 2:9-11

Both 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11 highlight the concept of exaltation in the Christian faith, though with slightly different emphasis.

**1 Peter 5:5-7:**

* Focuses on the **positioning** of believers in Christ.
* Exaltation is seen as God's act of elevating believers to a new level of spiritual authority and responsibility.
* Believers are empowered to serve one another and be "vigilant" in their faith.

**Philippians 2:9-11:**

* Emphasizes the **transformation** of believers in Christ.
* Exaltation involves the humbling of pride and the elevation of humility.
* Believers are called to imitate Christ's humility and selflessness.

**Connecting the two passages:**

* Both passages emphasize that exaltation is not an instantaneous event, but a process.
* Humility and service are essential steps in the process of becoming exalted.
* The ultimate goal of exaltation is to be like Christ, who was both fully human and fully divine.

**Key aspects of exaltation in the Christian faith:**

* **Divine empowerment:** Exaltation is ultimately God's work, not our own.
* **Transformation of character:** Humility and service are crucial for exaltation.
* **Increased responsibility:** Exalted believers are called to greater service and leadership.
* **Eternal privilege:** Exaltation is a permanent benefit for those who are faithful to Christ.

**Conclusion:**

These two passages demonstrate that exaltation in the Christian faith is not about achieving personal glory or power, but about becoming more like Christ and serving others. This process involves humility, service, and faithfulness to God.
