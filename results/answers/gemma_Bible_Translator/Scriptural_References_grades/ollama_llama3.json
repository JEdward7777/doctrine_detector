  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response correctly identifies the book and chapter where God is referred to as \"Almighty\", which aligns with the given answer. However, it could be improved by providing more context or elaboration on the significance of God being called \"Almighty\" in relation to Abraham's journey and the promises made to him.\n\nThe concern about knowing biblical references deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises is relevant here, as understanding this specific reference can help readers see God's sovereignty and power in their own lives. While the response provides a correct answer, it could be more impactful if it also explored the spiritual significance of this passage."
