The reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham can be found in the **Genesis** book of the Bible, specifically in **Genesis 17:1** - "And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing to the nations, and you shall be **Almighty** in the land."

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 80.

The response correctly identifies the book and chapter where God is referred to as "Almighty", which aligns with the given answer. However, it could be improved by providing more context or elaboration on the significance of God being called "Almighty" in relation to Abraham's journey and the promises made to him.

The concern about knowing biblical references deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises is relevant here, as understanding this specific reference can help readers see God's sovereignty and power in their own lives. While the response provides a correct answer, it could be more impactful if it also explored the spiritual significance of this passage.
