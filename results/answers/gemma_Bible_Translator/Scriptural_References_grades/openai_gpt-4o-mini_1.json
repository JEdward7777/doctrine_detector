  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately states the specific biblical reference to God as 'Almighty' in Genesis 17:1, demonstrating knowledge of the biblical text. Understanding such references indeed aids in strengthening one's connection to Scripture and the promises of God. A well-done response, although could have been enhanced by further elaboration on the significance of this title for God in relation to Abraham's blessings."
