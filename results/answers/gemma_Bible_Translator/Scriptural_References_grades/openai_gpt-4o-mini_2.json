  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the reference to God as 'Almighty' in the book of Genesis and provides the specific verse (Genesis 17:1), demonstrating a good understanding of biblical content. The concern about knowing biblical references to deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises is effectively addressed. A strong response overall."
