  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses emphasizing restoration and included detailed interpretations for each verse. The illustrations of restoration provided are relevant and align well with the theme. However, the student could have benefitted from including one or both of the reference verses provided by the teacher to further strengthen their argument from a Christian worldview perspective."
