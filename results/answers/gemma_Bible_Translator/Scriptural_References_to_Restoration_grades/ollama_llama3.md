I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response provides several biblical verses that emphasize restoration, including Romans 8:21, Isaiah 65:17, Revelation 21:5, Psalm 102:25, and 2 Corinthians 5:17. These verses highlight God's desire to restore creation, his people, and individuals through Christ's sacrifice. The response also provides illustrations of restoration, such as the resurrection of Jesus Christ, new birth in Christianity, healing of the sick, reconciliation with God, and the second coming of Christ.

However, the main issue is that the provided answer does not specifically address the concern of finding scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey. The response provides a broad overview of biblical verses related to restoration, but it does not explicitly connect these verses to the idea of personal restoration or provide specific examples of how these verses can be applied to an individual's faith journey.

To improve this response, it would be helpful to include more explicit connections between the biblical verses and the concept of restoration in one's faith journey. This could involve providing specific examples of how these verses have been used to encourage personal renewal and reconciliation in one's life or the lives of others.
