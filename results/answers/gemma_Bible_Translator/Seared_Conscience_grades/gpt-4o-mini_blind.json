  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear explanation of what a \"seared\" conscience means in the Bible, supported by relevant biblical references. It effectively highlights the implications for a believer, emphasizing self-awareness, humility, repentance, and the potential for restoration through forgiveness and faith in Christ. The answer maintains a doctrinally sound perspective and offers important considerations on how to approach this topic with grace and compassion. However, there could be a deeper exploration of the consequences of a seared conscience in terms of spiritual consequences for the believer. Overall, a solid and well-rounded response."
