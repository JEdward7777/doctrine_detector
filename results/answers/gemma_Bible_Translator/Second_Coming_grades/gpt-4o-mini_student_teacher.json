  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the implications of Jesus' statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds. They addressed various key points including the literal future return, the triumphant nature of the return, the connection to a future resurrection, the call to vigilance for believers, and the comfort and encouragement this promise provides. Additionally, they supported their points with relevant biblical references. The only area where the answer could be improved is by directly stating the connection to believers' hope in Jesus' ultimate authority and the fulfillment of God's promises, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response with a thorough analysis."
