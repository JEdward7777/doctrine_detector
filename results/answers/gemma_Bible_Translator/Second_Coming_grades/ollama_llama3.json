  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe student does touch on some of the implications of Jesus' return as the Son of Man, mentioning hope in His ultimate authority and the fulfillment of God's promises. However, their answer is quite general and lacks depth in exploring the specific points made by Jesus about his return. The concern was to grasp the implications for Christian hope and eschatology, but this response only scratches the surface.\n\nA higher score would require a more nuanced understanding of the biblical passages mentioned, such as Matthew 24:30, Acts 1:9-11, and 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. The student's answer could benefit from incorporating these scriptural references to support their claims and provide further insight into the significance of Jesus' return for Christian hope and eschatology.\n\nComment: While this response shows some awareness of the general implications of Jesus' return, it needs more development and biblical backing to effectively address the concern."
