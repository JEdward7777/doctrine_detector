It effectively addresses the concern by discussing the literal future return, the triumphant nature of the return, the future resurrection, the call to vigilance, and the source of comfort and encouragement for believers. The biblical references provided further strengthen the response and demonstrate a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job overall!"
