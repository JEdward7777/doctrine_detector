  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed response that effectively highlights the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings, focusing on pride, distortion of truth, separation from God, inhibition of spiritual growth, damage to relationships, false confidence, and disqualification for ministry. The inclusion of relevant biblical references and principles on humility further strengthens the answer. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the negative consequences of pride and the importance of humility before God."
