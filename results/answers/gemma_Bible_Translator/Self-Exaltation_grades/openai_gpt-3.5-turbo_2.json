The inclusion of specific biblical references strengthens the argument and demonstrates a sound understanding of Christian principles. The response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride by highlighting the importance of humility and dependence on God. The only slight improvement could be to directly reference the biblical principles for humility mentioned at the end within the main points."
