  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the Pharisees' concerns about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological and historical context surrounding this issue, and effectively outlines the Pharisees' beliefs and motivations. The answer could be strengthened by integrating specific biblical references to support its points, but overall, it is well-written and doctrinally sound."
