  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the Pharisees' concerns regarding separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles. The student effectively highlighted the Pharisees' beliefs, motivations, and actions in line with the Christian worldview. Your answer aligns well with the teacher's reference, but there could be greater emphasis on the religious purity aspect to fully resonate with the Christian perspective. Overall, a strong and informed response."
