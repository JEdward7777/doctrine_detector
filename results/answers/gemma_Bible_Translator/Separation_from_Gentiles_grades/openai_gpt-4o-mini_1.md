## [Answer](../Separation_from_Gentiles.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Pharisees' concern about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles stemmed from their interpretation of the Torah. They believed that God's covenant with Abraham included a specific plan for the preservation and blessing of the Jewish nation.

**Their beliefs included:**

* **Chosenness:** The Jews were God's chosen people, and their relationship with God was unique and special.
* **Separation:** Maintaining separation between Judaism and other nations was essential for preserving God's covenant.
* **Mission:** The Jews had a responsibility to be a light to the nations and to spread God's knowledge and worship.

**The Pharisees saw the mingling of the Jewish people with Gentiles as potentially:**

* **Compromising their identity:** Mixing with non-Jews could dilute the purity of Judaism and threaten its distinctive practices and beliefs.
* **Threatening their spiritual continuity:** The covenant relationship with God was conditional upon faithfulness, and their association with Gentiles could lead to spiritual decline.
* **Distracting from their mission:** By focusing on their own religious practices, the Jews would be less able to fulfill their role as a beacon of hope and wisdom to the Gentiles.

**These beliefs led the Pharisees to take various measures to maintain separation between the Jewish people and the Gentiles, such as:**

* Restricting interaction between Jews and Gentiles.
* Encouraging the observance of strict dietary and ritual laws.
* Promoting the separation of Jewish communities from Gentile societies.
