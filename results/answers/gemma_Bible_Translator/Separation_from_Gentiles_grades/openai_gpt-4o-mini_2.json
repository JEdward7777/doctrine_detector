It also outlines specific measures taken by the Pharisees to maintain separation. The explanation aligns well with the concern of upholding faith in a diverse cultural context, showing a deep understanding of the religious and cultural dynamics at play during that time. Great job in providing a thorough and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
