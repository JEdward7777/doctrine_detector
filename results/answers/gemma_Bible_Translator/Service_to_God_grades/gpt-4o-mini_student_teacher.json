  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response provides comprehensive and well-thought-out ways in which Christians can serve God in their ministry through the act of translating and communicating Scripture, it deviates significantly from the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's focus on translation and interpretation work, while important, does not directly align with the practical, hands-on service aspects such as teaching, caring for the sick, and providing for the poor as outlined in the reference answer. While the student's response is detailed and thoughtful, it lacks direct alignment with the specific actions of ministry highlighted in the reference answer."
