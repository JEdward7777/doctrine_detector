  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided good insights into various interpretations of the rainbow in biblical and cultural contexts, showing a comprehensive understanding of the topic. However, the student failed to accurately address the specific concern of understanding God's covenant and promises in the Bible as referenced in Genesis. It is important to focus on the direct biblical evidence and significance of the rainbow as a sign of God's covenant with humanity, which the student did not clearly articulate. Further emphasis on aligning the explanation with the biblical text would have improved the grade."
