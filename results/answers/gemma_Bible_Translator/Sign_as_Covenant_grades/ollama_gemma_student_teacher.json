  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical and cultural interpretations of the rainbow. They accurately point out that the rainbow is not explicitly mentioned in Genesis as a sign of God's covenant with humanity, but suggest its presence based on interpretations of Genesis 9:13-17. The student also provides relevant biblical references and historical/cultural interpretations of the rainbow. While the student's answer correctly acknowledges the interpretive nature of the rainbow's significance in Genesis, it could benefit from a closer analysis of the specific biblical passages mentioned in the concern."
