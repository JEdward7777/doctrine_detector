## [Answer](../Sign_as_Covenant.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The rainbow is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible as a sign of God's covenant with humanity in Genesis.** While some interpretations suggest its presence in Genesis 9:13-17, there is no direct biblical evidence to support this claim.

**Biblical interpretations of the rainbow:**

* The rainbow is often associated with God's faithfulness and blessings. (Genesis 9:13-17, Revelation 4:3)
* It symbolizes God's mercy and grace. (2 Peter 3:12)
* The rainbow reminds us of God's promise of redemption and hope. (Isaiah 58:8)

**Historical and cultural interpretations of the rainbow:**

* Many cultures have their own interpretations and beliefs about rainbows.
* Some ancient cultures associated rainbows with deities or spirits.

**Therefore, while the rainbow is a beautiful and significant natural phenomenon, its significance in Genesis regarding a covenant with humanity remains an interpretive question with no definitive biblical evidence.**
