The additional information on different biblical interpretations and historical/cultural perspectives adds depth to the discussion. However, the acknowledgment that the exact significance in Genesis remains an interpretive question without definitive biblical evidence shows a nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding biblical interpretations. Just a minor deduction for not explicitly mentioning the connection to God's covenant with humanity in Genesis 9:13-17."
