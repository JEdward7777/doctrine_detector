## [Answer](../Sign_of_the_Messiah.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke regarding the birth of Jesus is multifaceted and speaks to the fulfillment of prophecy, divine providence, and the universality of God's salvation.

**1. Fulfillment of Prophecy:**

- The Old Testament foretold the birth of a Savior who would be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2).
- The sign of the "bright star" likely refers to the astrological phenomenon known as a "Christmas star," which was prominently visible in the Eastern skies at the time of Jesus' birth.
- This convergence of events confirms the divine origin of Jesus' birth.

**2. Divine Providence:**

- The use of a sign demonstrates God's deliberate action in Jesus' birth.
- The shepherds, who were faithfully tending their flocks at night, were chosen as the recipients of this extraordinary message.
- This highlights God's concern for the ordinary people and his desire to reach them with the good news.

**3. Universality of Salvation:**

- The shepherds were not traditional religious figures or leaders.
- Their inclusion in the story demonstrates that salvation is not limited to a specific social or economic class.
- It is available to all who hear the message and believe.

**4. Announcement of the Good News:**

- The sign serves as a herald, announcing the birth of the Savior.
- The shepherds are instructed to " gloria a Deo" (Luke 2:14), which means "glorify God," indicating the immense importance of Jesus' birth.

**5. Witnessing to the Resurrection:**

- The shepherds are mentioned as witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus (Luke 24:13).
- This reinforces the connection between Jesus' birth and his ultimate sacrifice and resurrection.

Therefore, the sign given to the shepherds stands as a testament to the fulfillment of prophecy, God's divine providence, the universality of salvation, the announcement of the Good News, and the witness to Jesus' resurrection.
