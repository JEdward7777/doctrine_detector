  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer regarding the significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke. They effectively highlighted various aspects such as the fulfillment of prophecy, divine providence, universality of salvation, announcement of the Good News, and witnessing to Jesus' resurrection. However, the concern specifically asked for recognition of the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs. The reference answer, which focuses on the specific indication of the arrival of the Messiah through the sign of the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger, directly addresses this concern. While the student's answer is comprehensive, it deviates slightly from the specific focus of the concern provided."
