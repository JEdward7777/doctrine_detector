The response effectively connects the sign to the fulfillment of prophecy, divine providence, the universality of salvation, the announcement of the Good News, and the witness to Jesus' resurrection. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical narrative and how the sign given to the shepherds reflects God's overarching plan of salvation. Great job!"
