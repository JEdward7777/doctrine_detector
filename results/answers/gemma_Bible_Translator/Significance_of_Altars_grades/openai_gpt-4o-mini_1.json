The inclusion of various aspects such as communal covenant renewal, access to God's throne room, forgiveness, reconciliation, and the foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice enriches the understanding of the importance of altars in biblical worship for Christians. The response effectively ties in the Christian perspective with the historical and theological significance of altars in a cohesive manner."
