  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the significance of anointing in the Old Testament for priests, kings, and prophets. They effectively highlight the concepts of sanctification, divine appointment, empowerment for leadership, symbolic representation, and continuity and lineage in relation to anointing. The examples provided further solidify their understanding of the topic. The only minor critique is that the answer could have been slightly more concise and focused on directly addressing the teacher's reference answer. Overall, an excellent grasp of the importance of anointing in biblical leadership roles."
