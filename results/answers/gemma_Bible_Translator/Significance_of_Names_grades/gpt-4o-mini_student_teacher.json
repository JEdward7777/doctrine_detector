  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 75.\n\nThe student has provided a well-reasoned response that addresses the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations from multiple perspectives. They have highlighted theological interpretation, contextual understanding, theological integrity, consistency across translations, and the importance of avoiding confusion with other names for God. While the student's answer is thorough and incorporates relevant points, they missed the crucial aspect emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The reference answer emphasizes that translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God. This central point is not explicitly addressed in the student's response, impacting the overall alignment with the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. Therefore, the student's answer demonstrates a good understanding but could benefit from further connecting the significance of translating 'Shaddai' to God's relational aspect as highlighted in the reference answer."
