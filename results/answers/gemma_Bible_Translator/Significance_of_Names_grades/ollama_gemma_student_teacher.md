## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name:**

**1. Theological interpretation:**

* 'Shaddai' is primarily used in biblical contexts to describe God's attributes of power and sovereignty.
* Translating it as a title emphasizes these attributes rather than ascribing it as a specific name to a deity.

**2. Contextual understanding:**

* In the biblical texts, 'Shaddai' is often used alongside other titles for God, such as 'Yahweh' or 'Lord.'
* Translating it as a title maintains the continuity and coherence of the biblical narrative.

**3. Theological integrity:**

* Christianity affirms that God is one, with attributes of love, mercy, and sovereignty.
* Translating 'Shaddai' as a title aligns with this theological belief, emphasizing God's multifaceted nature without compromising the deity of Christ.

**4. Consistency across translations:**

* Many reputable Bible translations consistently translate 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name.
* This consistency helps to maintain clarity and avoids confusion among readers.

**5. Avoiding confusion with other names:**

* Translating 'Shaddai' as a title avoids confusion with other names for God that may be interpreted literally.
* This approach is particularly important in contexts where the Bible is translated into multiple languages.
