## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name:**

**1. Theological interpretation:**

* 'Shaddai' is primarily used in biblical contexts to describe God's attributes of power and sovereignty.
* Translating it as a title emphasizes these attributes rather than ascribing it as a specific name to a deity.

**2. Contextual understanding:**

* In the biblical texts, 'Shaddai' is often used alongside other titles for God, such as 'Yahweh' or 'Lord.'
* Translating it as a title maintains the continuity and coherence of the biblical narrative.

**3. Theological integrity:**

* Christianity affirms that God is one, with attributes of love, mercy, and sovereignty.
* Translating 'Shaddai' as a title aligns with this theological belief, emphasizing God's multifaceted nature without compromising the deity of Christ.

**4. Consistency across translations:**

* Many reputable Bible translations consistently translate 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name.
* This consistency helps to maintain clarity and avoids confusion among readers.

**5. Avoiding confusion with other names:**

* Translating 'Shaddai' as a title avoids confusion with other names for God that may be interpreted literally.
* This approach is particularly important in contexts where the Bible is translated into multiple languages.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name. It correctly highlights God's attributes, such as omnipotence and strength, which are emphasized when 'Shaddai' is translated as a title. Additionally, the response acknowledges the relational aspect of God, mentioning a personal relationship with Him when it is used as a name.

However, to further deepen our understanding of God's character and relational aspect in Christian faith, the response could benefit from more specific biblical examples and illustrations that demonstrate how 'Shaddai' conveys these attributes and their implications for our relationship with God.
