  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and well-supported explanation of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name. It addresses the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith by emphasizing the attributes of God while also acknowledging the importance of maintaining a personal relationship with Him. The theological, contextual, and translational considerations are well-explained and align well with a Christian worldview. Overall, the response effectively connects the translation choice to Christian beliefs and theological integrity."
