However, there was a lack of focus on the specific concern of understanding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. The answer could have been stronger by emphasizing more on how the Holy Spirit empowered believers for ministry and how this event fulfilled Jesus' promise, which would align more closely with the Christian worldview perspective."
