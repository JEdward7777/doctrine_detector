Comment: The student accurately describes the role of a tetrarch during the time of Jesus and connects it well to the governance structure of the Roman Empire. However, the answer could be improved by mentioning the specific tetrarchs who ruled during Jesus' time, such as Herod Antipas. Additionally, providing some biblical context regarding the interactions of Jesus with these tetrarchs would enhance the answer.
