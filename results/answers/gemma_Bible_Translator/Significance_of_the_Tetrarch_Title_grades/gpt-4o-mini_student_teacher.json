  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80.\n\nWhile the student accurately identifies that the title \"tetrarch\" signifies shared authority over a specific region, and mentions the responsibilities of tetrarchs, there is room for improvement in connecting this governance structure to the specific political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry. The student could have further emphasized how the system of tetrarchs impacted the interactions between the Roman rulers and the Jewish population, helping believers understand the complexities and power dynamics at play during that time. Therefore, a slightly higher grade could have been achieved by making stronger connections between the governance structure and the political tensions present during Christ's life."
