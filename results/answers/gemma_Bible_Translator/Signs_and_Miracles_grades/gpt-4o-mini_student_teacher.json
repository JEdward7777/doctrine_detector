  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer an 85.\n\nWhile the student thoroughly addresses the role of signs and miracles in proving the truth of God's message as seen in the acts of Jesus and the apostles, and provides detailed biblical examples and theological significance, there are a few areas that could be improved. The student does a good job of connecting signs and miracles to the validation of divine authority. However, the student could have focused more on the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation as specified in the concern.\n\nAdditionally, the challenges and interpretations section could have been more thoroughly developed to address how faith interacts with signs and miracles in the context of God's revelation. The conclusion could also be strengthened by tying back to the concern provided.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and provides a well-constructed answer, but could benefit from deeper analysis and application of the concern to enhance the overall coherence of the response."
