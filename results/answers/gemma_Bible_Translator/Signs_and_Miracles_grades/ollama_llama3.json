  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the significance of signs and miracles in the Bible, highlighting their role in validating God's power and authority, as well as their impact on the early church and Christian faith. The inclusion of specific biblical examples and theological reflections adds depth and richness to the discussion.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points for a few reasons:\n\n* While the response does touch on the importance of balancing truth and faith, it could delve deeper into this issue and explore potential pitfalls or criticisms related to relying too heavily on signs and miracles.\n* Some of the sections feel a bit disconnected from one another, and the transition between the different topics (Biblical Examples, Theological Significance, etc.) could be smoother.\n\nOverall, though, I believe the response provides a strong foundation for exploring the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation, and with some further development and refinement, it has the potential to receive an even higher grade."
