It addresses the concern by emphasizing that signs and miracles are not the sole basis for faith, but rather complement and enhance the understanding of God's revelation. The biblical examples, theological significance, challenges, and conclusion are well-developed and supported by a Christian worldview. The only minor room for improvement could be expanding on how signs and miracles interact with the believers' faith journey in a more personalized context."
