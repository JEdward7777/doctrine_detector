  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. It acknowledges that signs and miracles serve as validations of God's power and authority, supporting the authenticity of Jesus and the apostles as messengers of God. The explanation of the theological significance and challenges surrounding signs and miracles demonstrates a solid understanding of how they interact with faith and God's revelation from a Christian worldview. However, the response could be enhanced by providing more specific examples and references to Scripture to bolster the argument further."
