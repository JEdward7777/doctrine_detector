  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive overview of the significance of Jesus as the 'Son of God' within Christianity, emphasizing essential biblical references, theological interpretations, and the practical implications of this relationship. However, the student could strengthen their answer by explicitly stating that Jesus is fully God and sharing the same nature as God the Father, as per the reference answer. This is a crucial aspect of understanding the divinity of Jesus, which the student touched upon but could have highlighted more explicitly."
