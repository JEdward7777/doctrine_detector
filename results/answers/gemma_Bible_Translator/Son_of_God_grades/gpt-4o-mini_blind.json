  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 90. The student accurately distinguishes the title \"Son of God\" as it refers to Jesus from the term \"sons of God\" used for believers from a Christian worldview. The answer clearly articulates the divine sonship of Jesus, His unique relationship with the Father, and His full divinity in contrast to believers being adopted as sons of God through faith in Christ, experiencing a new creation in Him, and sharing in spiritual blessings. The key distinctions provided are doctrinally sound and effectively highlight the essential differences between the two concepts. Great job overall!"
