  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" as it refers to Jesus and the term \"sons of God\" used for believers. They have highlighted important differences in divine sonship, nature, relationship, and authority. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly stating the core distinction that the title 'Son of God' specifically pertains to Jesus as God's only Son, while 'sons of God' refers broadly to all believers in Christ. Nonetheless, the student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and has presented the information clearly and comprehensively."
