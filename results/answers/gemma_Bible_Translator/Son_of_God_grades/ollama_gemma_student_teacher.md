**The title "Son of God" for Jesus:**

* **Divine Sonship:** Jesus is eternally begotten by God the Father, establishing his divine sonship. 
* **Unique Relationship:** Jesus is the only one who has ever been begotten by the Holy Spirit and shares the Father's nature.
* **Full Divinity:** He is fully God in essence and glory, sharing the divine throne and authority.

**The term "sons of God" for believers:**

* **Adoption:** Believers are declared "sons of God" through faith in Christ, receiving the privilege of sonship by God's grace.
* **New Creation:** The transformation through faith results in a new creation in Christ, becoming children of God.
* **Spiritual Relationship:** Believers share in the blessings and privileges of being God's children, receiving guidance, forgiveness, and eternal life.

**Key Distinctions:**

* **Nature:** The Son of God is divine in nature, while believers are human in nature.
* **Relationship:** The Son of God has a unique, eternal relationship with the Father, while believers have a relational, redeemed status as sons.
