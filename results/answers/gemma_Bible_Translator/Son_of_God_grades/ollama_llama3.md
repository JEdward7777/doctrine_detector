* **Full Divinity:** He is fully God in essence and glory, sharing the divine throne and authority.

**The term "sons of God" for believers:**

* **Adoption:** Believers are declared "sons of God" through faith in Christ, receiving the privilege of sonship by God's grace.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response partially addresses the concern of clarity on the distinction between Jesus as the Son of God and believers being sons of God. While it correctly states that "Son of God" specifically pertains to Jesus, it could be more explicit in highlighting the unique nature and relationship of Jesus' divine sonship compared to believers' adoption as sons.

The response also does a good job of outlining the key distinctions between Jesus' divinity and believers' humanity, as well as their respective relationships with God. However, it could be more thorough in exploring the implications of these distinctions for theological discussions.

To achieve a higher grade, the response could provide even clearer language and explanations to avoid confusion in theological discussions. For example, it could elaborate on how Jesus' divine sonship informs his unique role in salvation history, while believers' adoption as sons of God is rooted in their redemption through faith in Christ.
