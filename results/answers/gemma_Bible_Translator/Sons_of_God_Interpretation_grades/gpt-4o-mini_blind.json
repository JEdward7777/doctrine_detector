  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of various interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6. They have explored both literal and symbolic interpretations, as well as incorporating concepts of spiritual lineage, symbolic separation, and cultural context. The considerations and implications mentioned show a good understanding of the impact these interpretations can have on theological understanding. However, the student could improve the grade by providing more specific references to relevant biblical passages, theological arguments, and Church teachings to support their interpretations. Additionally, a clearer distinction between acceptable and erroneous viewpoints from a doctrinal perspective would strengthen the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological engagement."
