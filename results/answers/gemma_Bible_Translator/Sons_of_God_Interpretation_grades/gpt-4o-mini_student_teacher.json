  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of various interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, considering both literal and symbolic understandings. However, the student could improve by incorporating more specific references to biblical passages and theological arguments supporting each interpretation. Additionally, the student could engage more directly with the reference answer provided by the teacher to demonstrate a clearer comparison and analysis of the differing views. Overall, a solid effort but with room for deeper analysis and integration of key theological perspectives."
