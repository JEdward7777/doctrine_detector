The Biblical references cited are relevant and supportive of the points made. The additional notes offer helpful context and clarification on the concept of \"Sainthood.\" Overall, this is a solid and doctrinally sound explanation, with minor room for improvement, such as further elaboration on the role of faith in sanctification and glorification. Great job!"
