  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Christian doctrine of sanctification and its relationship to faith in Jesus Christ. The student clearly articulates the three stages of salvation - regeneration, sanctification, and glorification - and provides relevant biblical references to support their claims. Additionally, the student acknowledges the lack of explicit use of the term \"Sainthood\" in the Bible but explains its implication in the concepts of holiness and glorification."
