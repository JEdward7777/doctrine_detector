## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Believers become saints according to the Christian faith through:**

**1. Regeneration:**
* The Bible teaches that salvation is a work of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:16).
* When someone accepts Jesus as Lord and Savior, they are born again (regenerated) by the Holy Spirit (John 3:5).

**2. Sanctification:**
* Regeneration is followed by sanctification, which is the ongoing process of being made holy by the Holy Spirit.
* Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers are transformed into the image of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18).

**3. Glorification:**
* Ultimately, believers will be glorified when they meet Jesus Christ in heaven.
* This will be a complete and final transformation, where believers will be free from sin and suffering and will be like Christ (1 Corinthians 15:42-43).

**Biblical References:**

* "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on his name" (John 1:12).
* "For you were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit" (1 Corinthians 6:20).
* "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

**Additional Notes:**

* The concept of " Sainthood" is not explicitly used in the Bible, but it is implied in the ideas of being made holy, being like Christ, and ultimately being glorified.
* The process of sanctification is ongoing and will continue until believers are glorified.
* Believers are called to live lives that are pleasing to God and reflect the character of Christ.

95.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 95.

This response effectively clarifies the source of holiness by emphasizing faith in Jesus Christ, which aligns with the concern of reinforcing the central role of faith in the Christian doctrine. The provided explanation is comprehensive, covering the three stages of regeneration, sanctification, and glorification, and demonstrating a clear understanding of the biblical concepts.

The only aspect that prevents me from giving it a perfect score is the additional information provided at the end, which while helpful for further understanding, might distract from the main point. A more concise response focusing directly on the question would likely receive a higher grade.

Comment: This response demonstrates a strong grasp of Christian doctrine and effectively clarifies the source of holiness. With minor adjustments to focus more closely on the question, it could be even stronger.
