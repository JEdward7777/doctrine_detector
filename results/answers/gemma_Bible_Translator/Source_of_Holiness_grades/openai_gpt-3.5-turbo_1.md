Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

# Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Believers become saints according to the Christian faith through:**

**1. Regeneration:**
* The Bible teaches that salvation is a work of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:16).
* When someone accepts Jesus as Lord and Savior, they are born again (regenerated) by the Holy Spirit (John 3:5).

**2. Sanctification:**
* Regeneration is followed by sanctification, which is the ongoing process of being made holy by the Holy Spirit.
* Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers are transformed into the image of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18).

**3. Glorification:**
* Ultimately, believers will be glorified when they meet Jesus Christ in heaven.
* This will be a complete and final transformation, where believers will be free from sin and suffering and will be like Christ (1 Corinthians 15:42-43).

**Biblical References:**

* "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on his name" (John 1:12).
* "For you were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit" (1 Corinthians 6:20).
* "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

**Additional Notes:**

* The concept of " Sainthood" is not explicitly used in the Bible, but it is implied in the ideas of being made holy, being like Christ, and ultimately being glorified.
* The process of sanctification is ongoing and will continue until believers are glorified.
* Believers are called to live lives that are pleasing to God and reflect the character of Christ.
