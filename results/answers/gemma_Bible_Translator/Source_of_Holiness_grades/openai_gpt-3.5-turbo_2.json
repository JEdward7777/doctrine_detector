The response aligns well with the Christian worldview by highlighting that holiness comes from Jesus' saving work and believers' faith in Him, as supported by the Bible references provided. The clarification on the source of holiness strengthens the foundational belief that it is through Christ alone that believers are made holy and ultimately glorified. This response effectively integrates faith in Jesus as the key component in the process of becoming saints in Christianity."
