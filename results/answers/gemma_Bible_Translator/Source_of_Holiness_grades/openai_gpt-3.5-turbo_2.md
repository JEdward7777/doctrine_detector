## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Believers become saints according to the Christian faith through:**

**1. Regeneration:**
* The Bible teaches that salvation is a work of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:16).
* When someone accepts Jesus as Lord and Savior, they are born again (regenerated) by the Holy Spirit (John 3:5).

**2. Sanctification:**
* Regeneration is followed by sanctification, which is the ongoing process of being made holy by the Holy Spirit.
* Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers are transformed into the image of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18).

**3. Glorification:**
* Ultimately, believers will be glorified when they meet Jesus Christ in heaven.
* This will be a complete and final transformation, where believers will be free from sin and suffering and will be like Christ (1 Corinthians 15:42-43).

**Biblical References:**

* "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on his name" (John 1:12).
* "For you were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit" (1 Corinthians 6:20).
* "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

**Additional Notes:**

* The concept of " Sainthood" is not explicitly used in the Bible, but it is implied in the ideas of being made holy, being like Christ, and ultimately being glorified.
* The process of sanctification is ongoing and will continue until believers are glorified.
* Believers are called to live lives that are pleasing to God and reflect the character of Christ.

The response aligns well with the Christian worldview by highlighting that holiness comes from Jesus' saving work and believers' faith in Him, as supported by the Bible references provided. The clarification on the source of holiness strengthens the foundational belief that it is through Christ alone that believers are made holy and ultimately glorified. This response effectively integrates faith in Jesus as the key component in the process of becoming saints in Christianity.
