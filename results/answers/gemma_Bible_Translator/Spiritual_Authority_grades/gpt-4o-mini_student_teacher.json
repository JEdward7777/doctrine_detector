  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively explains the differences between spiritual and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. The answer incorporates relevant Biblical references and highlights key aspects of both types of authority. However, the answer could have included a more direct reference to the specific verse mentioned in the teacher's reference answer (Ephesians 6:12) to align more closely with the given concern. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
