  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 90\n\n**Comments:** This is a well-written and insightful response that effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority in a Christian's life. The student clearly explains the nature of both types of authority, their distinct spheres of influence, and their hierarchical relationship. The inclusion of biblical references and practical principles for navigating these authorities demonstrates a deep understanding of the text and its application in daily life."
