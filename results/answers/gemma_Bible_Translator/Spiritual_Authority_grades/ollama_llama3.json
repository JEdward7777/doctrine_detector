  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by recognizing the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority and their implications in a Christian's life. It provides clear definitions and examples of both types of authorities, highlighting their different spheres of influence and sources of authority.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved to achieve a higher score:\n\n* While the response mentions Ephesians 6:12 as a reference for spiritual authorities, it does not fully develop this point or show how it relates to the broader biblical teaching on authority.\n* The summary at the end of the response is brief and could be expanded to provide more context and application for Christians.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical teaching on authority and provides clear explanations and examples. With some further development and expansion, it has the potential to be even stronger."
