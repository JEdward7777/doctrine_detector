# Stated Concern
Recognizing the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority and their implications in a Christian's life

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Biblical teaching differentiates between spiritual authorities and earthly authorities based on their source of authority and their spheres of influence:**

**1. Spiritual Authorities:**

* Derived from God himself (2 Corinthians 13:14).
* Exercise authority in the realm of spiritual things, such as forgiveness of sins, guidance, and spiritual understanding.
* Represent God's authority on earth and are subject to his ultimate rule.
* Examples include apostles, prophets, pastors, and other spiritual leaders.

**2. Earthly Authorities:**

* Established by God for maintaining order and societal functioning (Romans 13:1-7).
* Exercise authority in temporal matters, such as governance, law enforcement, and social regulations.
* Their authority is limited to the physical realm and does not extend into spiritual matters.
* Examples include government officials, police officers, and judges.

**The relationship between spiritual and earthly authorities is hierarchical:**

* Spiritual authorities are subject to God's authority and are called to uphold his laws.
* Earthly authorities are created by God and are accountable to him for their actions.
* Conflict between the two authorities should be resolved in light of God's Word (1 Peter 3:15).

**Biblical principles guide Christians in navigating the relationship between these two authorities:**

* **Submission:** Christians are called to submit to both spiritual and earthly authorities (Romans 13:1-7).
* **Discernment:** Believers should discern between the two authorities and exercise their faith accordingly.
* **Integrity:** Christians should live in integrity and honor both spiritual and earthly authorities.

**In summary, spiritual authorities have authority in the spiritual realm, while earthly authorities have authority in the physical realm. Both authorities are subject to God's ultimate authority and Christians are called to submit to both responsibly.**
