It effectively addresses the concern by clearly differentiating between spiritual and worldly authority and how they impact a Christian's life. The references to relevant Bible verses strengthen the argument. The response could be further improved by expanding on how Christians should navigate situations where spiritual and earthly authorities may conflict."
