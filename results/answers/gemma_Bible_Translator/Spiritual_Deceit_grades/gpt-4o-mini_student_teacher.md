Comment: The student correctly acknowledges the absence of information in the provided text regarding the role of demons in idolatry but misses an opportunity to apply a Christian worldview to explain that demons deceive people into believing in false gods and idols that divert them from the truth of God's sovereignty. Encouraging the student to consider integrating biblical principles to engage with the topic more deeply would enhance their understanding and response.
