I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response correctly acknowledges that the provided text does not contain information about demons, which is a fair assessment given the context. However, it fails to address the concern about spiritual deceit and its relevance to the question. The response also lacks any explicit connection to Christian theology or biblical principles, such as God's sovereignty.

To improve this response, I would suggest that the student provide more insight into how demons deceive people into idolatry, and how Christians can be vigilant against these influences. Additionally, incorporating relevant biblical passages or theological concepts could strengthen the response and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the issue.
