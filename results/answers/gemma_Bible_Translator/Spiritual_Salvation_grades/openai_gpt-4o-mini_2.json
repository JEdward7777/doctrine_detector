It touches on key aspects such as reconciliation with God, new life in Christ, eternal life, forgiveness of sins, access to God's promises, new identity in Christ, community and belonging, and empowerment to serve. While it demonstrates a good understanding of the holistic nature of salvation, it could have further emphasized the transformative aspect of salvation in a believer's life in relation to the concern about faith and assurance of eternal life."
