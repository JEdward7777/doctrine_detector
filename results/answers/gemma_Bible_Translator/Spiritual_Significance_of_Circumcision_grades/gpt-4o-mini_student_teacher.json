  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-supported explanation of the symbolic meaning of the circumcision of the heart in a Christian context. They effectively connected the concept to relevant Bible verses and emphasized the spiritual nature of this transformation. The explanation aligned closely with the reference answer, but the student's additional insights and explanations enhance their response."
