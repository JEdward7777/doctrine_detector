## [Answer](../Spiritual_Significance_of_Circumcision.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The circumcision of the heart symbolizes a radical transformation of the inner life, where one's sinful desires and affections are removed, and a new heart filled with love for God and others is formed.**

This concept is found in several passages of the New Testament:

* **Romans 2:29:** "He will give you a new heart and a new spirit."
* **Colossians 2:12:** "Putting off the old self with its habits and passions, and putting on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the likeness of its Creator."
* **Heart transplant metaphor:** 1 John 3:1-3 speaks of a spiritual transformation where the old heart of sin is replaced with a new heart that loves like God loves.

**The circumcision of the heart is not a physical procedure, but a spiritual one.** It involves:

* **Repentance:** Turning away from sin and turning towards God.
* **Humility:** Recognizing our need for God's forgiveness and grace.
* **Faith:** Accepting God's love and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.
* **Transformation:** Developing a new character and lifestyle that reflects God's love.

**The circumcision of the heart is a continuous process of spiritual growth and transformation.** As believers live in relationship with God, their hearts are progressively renewed and transformed by the Holy Spirit.
