# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The circumcision of the heart symbolizes a radical transformation of the inner life, where one's sinful desires and affections are removed, and a new heart filled with love for God and others is formed.**

This concept is found in several passages of the New Testament:

* **Romans 2:29:** "He will give you a new heart and a new spirit."
* **Colossians 2:12:** "Putting off the old self with its habits and passions, and putting on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the likeness of its Creator."
* **Heart transplant metaphor:** 1 John 3:1-3 speaks of a spiritual transformation where the old heart of sin is replaced with a new heart that loves like God loves.

**The circumcision of the heart is not a physical procedure, but a spiritual one.** It involves:

* **Repentance:** Turning away from sin and turning towards God.
* **Humility:** Recognizing our need for God's forgiveness and grace.
* **Faith:** Accepting God's love and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.
* **Transformation:** Developing a new character and lifestyle that reflects God's love.

**The circumcision of the heart is a continuous process of spiritual growth and transformation.** As believers live in relationship with God, their hearts are progressively renewed and transformed by the Holy Spirit.

The integration of relevant Bible verses and the emphasis on repentance, humility, faith, and ongoing transformation demonstrate a strong grasp of the topic from a Christian perspective. The response addresses the concern by clearly distinguishing the spiritual nature of the circumcision of the heart from any physical practice in modern Christianity.
