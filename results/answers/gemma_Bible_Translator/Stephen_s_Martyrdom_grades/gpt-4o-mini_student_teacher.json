  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church, drawing connections to themes of escalating hostility, Christian forgiveness, and parallels with Jesus Christ's sacrifice. The response effectively addresses the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. The inclusion of additional theological considerations and a well-rounded conclusion further enriches the response. The student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
