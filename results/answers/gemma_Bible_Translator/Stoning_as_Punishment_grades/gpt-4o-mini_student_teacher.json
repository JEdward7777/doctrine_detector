However, the student could have strengthened the analysis by directly addressing how the practice of stoning reflects God's justice and mercy, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the balance between justice and mercy in God's commandments, especially in light of Jesus' interaction in the New Testament, would have further enriched the response."
