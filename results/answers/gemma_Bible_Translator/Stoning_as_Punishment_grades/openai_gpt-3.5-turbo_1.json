It effectively highlights the shift in emphasis from strict punishment to mercy and forgiveness in Jesus's teachings in the New Testament. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly connecting the Old Testament practice of stoning to the overarching Christian understanding of justice and mercy as demonstrated by Jesus in the New Testament. Integrating this connection would provide a more comprehensive Christian worldview perspective on the topic."
