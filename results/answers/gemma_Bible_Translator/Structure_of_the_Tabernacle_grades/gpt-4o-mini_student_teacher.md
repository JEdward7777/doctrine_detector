Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a detailed and accurate description of the two main sections of the tabernacle, outlining the significance of the items located in each section in worship. However, the student's answer deviates significantly from the reference answer provided by the teacher, which stated that the Holy Place contained the altar for burning incense, and the Most Holy Place housed the ark of the covenant. While the student's answer is informative and well-written, the divergence from the reference answer impacts the accuracy of the response in the context of the given concern.
