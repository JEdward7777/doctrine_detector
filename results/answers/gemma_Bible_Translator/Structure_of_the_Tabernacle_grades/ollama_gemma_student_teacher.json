  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comments:** The student's answer accurately describes the two main sections of the tabernacle and their intended uses. They also provide concise summaries of the items located in each section and their significance. However, the answer lacks some elaboration on the spiritual significance of these items within a Christian worldview, particularly in relation to worship. Including references to relevant biblical passages or theological interpretations would further elevate the quality of the response."
