The correct answer only mentions the altar for burning incense and the ark of the covenant, whereas the original response provides a more comprehensive overview of both the Outer Court and the Holy Place. While it does mention some specific items, such as the golden altar of incense and the mercy seat, it does not fully explore their significance in worship. To better address the concern, the response could have delved deeper into how these components contributed to God's presence, provision, and illumination in the life of His people."
