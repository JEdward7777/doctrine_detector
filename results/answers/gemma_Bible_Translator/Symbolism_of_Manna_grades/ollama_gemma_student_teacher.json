  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 90\n\n**Comments:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the symbolism of manna in relation to God's provision. The student effectively connects the physical sustenance of manna to the spiritual nourishment believers receive through God's Word and grace. The inclusion of references to the temporary vs. eternal nature of manna, faith and dependence, and the miraculous sign of God's care adds depth and nuance to the analysis."
