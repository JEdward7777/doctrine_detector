  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of the metaphor of the cornerstone in relation to Jesus and His followers. The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of the foundational role of Jesus in the Christian faith and how this metaphor extends to various aspects of the relationship between Jesus and His followers. The response is well-structured, clear, and incorporates key theological concepts in a coherent manner. One suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more specific scriptural references to support the points made, enhancing the doctrinal correctness of the response. Overall, this is a strong and insightful analysis."
