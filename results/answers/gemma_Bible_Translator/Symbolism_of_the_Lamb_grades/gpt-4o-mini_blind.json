  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: The answer provides a thorough explanation of the significance of using lambs in biblical sacrifices and effectively connects it to the concept of atonement. The response accurately highlights the symbolic nature of the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, pointing to Jesus Christ as the ultimate atoning sacrifice and Lamb of God. The explanation is clear, concise, and well-supported with biblical references. However, to enhance the answer further, the inclusion of specific scriptural passages (such as Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29) could have added more depth to the explanation. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
