Additionally, the student connects the spiritual principles learned in the synagogues to the development of Christianity and acknowledges the ongoing influence of the synagogue on Christian faith and practice.\n\nThe suggestion that the term \"synagogue\" can also refer figuratively to the group of people who meet for worship aligns with the teacher's reference answer and further reinforces the spiritual understanding of the term."
