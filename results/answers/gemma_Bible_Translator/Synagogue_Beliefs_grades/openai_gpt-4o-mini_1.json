It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how the term 'synagogue' represents the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship. The Christian-specific worldview is evident in connecting the early Christian gatherings in synagogues to spiritual growth, community formation, and the influence on Christian faith. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the deeper spiritual implications of the term 'synagogue' within a Christian context."
