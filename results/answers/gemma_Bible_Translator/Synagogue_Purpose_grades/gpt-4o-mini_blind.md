## [Answer](../Synagogue_Purpose.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Synagogues did not play a role in the worship practices of Jews during ancient times.** Worship practices for ancient Jews centered around the Temple in Jerusalem and other sacrificial and devotional rituals associated with the Mosaic Law. Synagogues primarily served as social and educational centers for Jews, not religious worship spaces.

Grade: 50

Comment: While the student correctly pointed out that the Temple in Jerusalem was central to Jewish worship practices during ancient times, they inaccurately stated that synagogues did not play a role in worship. Synagogues did have a religious role in terms of prayer, study, and community gatherings outside of the Temple rituals. The response lacked nuance and depth in explaining the multifaceted role of synagogues in ancient Jewish worship practices.
