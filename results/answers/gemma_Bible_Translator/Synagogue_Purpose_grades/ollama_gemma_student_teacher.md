## [Answer](../Synagogue_Purpose.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Synagogues did not play a role in the worship practices of Jews during ancient times.** Worship practices for ancient Jews centered around the Temple in Jerusalem and other sacrificial and devotional rituals associated with the Mosaic Law. Synagogues primarily served as social and educational centers for Jews, not religious worship spaces.

**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 
While the student's answer correctly states that synagogues were not primarily used for worship in ancient times, it lacks nuance and fails to acknowledge the multifaceted role of synagogues in Jewish life. The reference answer highlights the fact that synagogues served as places for prayer, scripture reading, and teaching, which is an important aspect of worship practice for many Jews.
