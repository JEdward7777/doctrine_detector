The statement \"Synagogues primarily served as social and educational centers for Jews, not religious worship spaces\" is an oversimplification and potentially misleading.\n\nA more accurate response would acknowledge that while the Temple in Jerusalem was the primary site for animal sacrifices and other Mosaic Law-related rituals, synagogues still played a vital role in Jewish worship, particularly during times of exile or when access to the Temple was limited. Synagogues served as alternative spaces where Jews could continue their spiritual practices, such as praying, reading scripture, and teaching.\n\nTo improve this response, it's essential to provide a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between the Temple and synagogues in ancient Jewish worship practices."
