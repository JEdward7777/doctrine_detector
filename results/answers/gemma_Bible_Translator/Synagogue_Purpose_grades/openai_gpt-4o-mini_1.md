Synagogues primarily served as social and educational centers for Jews, not religious worship spaces.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response correctly acknowledges that synagogues served as places for prayer, scripture reading, and teaching for Jews, especially those living far from the central Temple in Jerusalem. However, the response does not fully address the historical and religious importance of synagogues in Jewish worship, as it neglects to mention their significant role in fostering community, preserving Jewish identity, and keeping the faith alive during periods of exile or when the Temple was inaccessible.
