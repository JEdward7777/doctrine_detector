## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The association of "Zion" with the temple in Jerusalem arose from two biblical sources:**

**1. Psalm 133:**

> "For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has made her his habitation." (Psalm 133:2)

This psalm clearly associates Zion with God's chosen people and their dwelling place. Early Christians interpreted this to refer to the physical temple in Jerusalem, which was seen as God's dwelling place on earth.

**2. New Testament prophecies:**

Several prophecies in the New Testament speak of a future restoration of Zion, often interpreted as referring to the physical restoration of the temple and the reestablishment of Israel as a nation. Examples include:

* "Rejoice and be glad, because great is the restoration of Zion." (Luke 1:79)
* "Then shall the Branch of righteousness blossom for a crown of beauty, and the humble shall dwell in the righteousness of Zion." (Isaiah 53:10)

**Early Church interpretations:**

Early Christian writers like Origen and Augustine interpreted these passages as linking "Zion" with the physical temple in Jerusalem. This interpretation became widely accepted and remained the dominant view for centuries.

**However, it's important to note:**

* The biblical use of "Zion" is multifaceted and can refer to both the physical temple and the spiritual concept of God's people or covenant.
* Later interpretations of "Zion" may differ from the early Church understanding.
