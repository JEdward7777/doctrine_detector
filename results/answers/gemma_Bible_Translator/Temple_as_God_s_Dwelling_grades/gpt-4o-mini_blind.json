The explanation of the shift from the physical temple to the believer's heart as the dwelling place of God is well articulated, with appropriate scriptural references. The discussion on themes common to both Testaments and the additional considerations adds depth to the response. However, the explanation could benefit from further emphasizing the sacrificial and atoning aspects of the temple in the Old Testament, as they are crucial for understanding the significance of the temple in biblical theology. Additionally, connecting the concept of temple to Christ as the ultimate sacrifice and fulfillment of the temple system would enhance the theological depth of the answer."
