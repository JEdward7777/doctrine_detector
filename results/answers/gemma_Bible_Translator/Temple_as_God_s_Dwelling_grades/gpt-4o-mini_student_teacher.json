  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is expressed in both the Old and New Testaments. They effectively highlight the shift from the physical temple in the Old Testament to believers being referred to as the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. The student also makes connections between the two Testaments and discusses common themes effectively. However, the student could have incorporated more explicit references to specific biblical passages to strengthen their argument further."
