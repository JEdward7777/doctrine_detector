  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive overview of the concept of the temple in both the Old and New Testaments.\n* Articulate explanation of the shift from physical temple to the believer's heart as the new dwelling place of God.\n* Connection between the two Testaments and the ongoing revelation of God.\n* Inclusion of relevant themes and considerations.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The response could benefit from further elaboration on the theological implications of God dwelling among His people.\n* While the student acknowledges the New Testament's emphasis on the believer's heart, further exploration of how this transformation impacts the understanding of worship and ritual would strengthen the overall argument.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical concepts. However, incorporating additional analysis of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people would elevate the quality of the answer."
