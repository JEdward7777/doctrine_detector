## [Answer](../Temple_as_God_s_Dwelling.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
## The Concept of the Temple in both the Old and New Testaments:

**Old Testament:**

* The Temple in Jerusalem was understood as the physical dwelling of God among his people. 
* Psalms and prophets frequently speak of God's presence filling the Temple, highlighting its significance as a sanctuary for worship and prayer.
* The emphasis is on God's glory and power residing within the Temple, symbolizing his covenant relationship with his people.

**New Testament:**

* The New Testament reveals a shift in emphasis from the physical temple to the believer's heart as the new dwelling place of God.
* The writer of Hebrews states, "We do not have a temple made by human hands... but our hearts are his temple" (Hebrews 3:5).
* Christ himself is portrayed as the ultimate temple, where God's glory dwells in human form (John 2:22).

**Connecting the Old and New Testaments:**

* The transition from the physical temple to the spiritual temple reflects God's ongoing revelation and work in the lives of believers.
* While the physical temple served as a place for rituals and worship, the New Testament emphasizes a deeper connection with God through faith in Christ.

**Themes common to both Testaments:**

* **Divine presence:** The concept of God's presence filling the temple, whether physical or spiritual, remains central.
* **Sacramental significance:** The temple represents a space where God's presence becomes accessible to his people.
* **Access to God:** The temple provides a place for believers to approach God in prayer and worship.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The New Testament does not explicitly reject the concept of physical temples, but emphasizes the primacy of the believer's heart as the dwelling place of God.
* The Church continues to use physical spaces for worship and prayer, recognizing the importance of gathering together as a community. 
* Ultimately, the emphasis is on believing in Christ, who is the ultimate temple of God, and dwelling in the presence of the Holy Spirit.
