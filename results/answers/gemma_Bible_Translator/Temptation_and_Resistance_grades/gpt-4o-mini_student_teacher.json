  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. The student provided thorough explanations supported by biblical references on how Jesus responded to temptations, emphasizing his reliance on divine authority, spiritual preparation, firmness, dependence on God, humility, and obedience. The student also highlighted key lessons for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. While the student's response is detailed and well-structured, the teacher's reference answer is slightly more concise and direct in stating Jesus' victory in resisting temptations."
