The student effectively elaborates on key aspects such as drawing on divine authority, spiritual preparation, firmness, dependence on God, humility, and obedience. The connection to how understanding Jesus' resistance serves as a model for Christians in their spiritual battles against evil is well-developed. The response displays a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively applies it to the given concern. Great job!"
