  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-organized list of different terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in various Christian communities, including biblical, historical, contemporary, and denominational variations. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the diversity of terminology associated with this sacred practice within Christianity. However, they may have included some terms that are not commonly used or might be more specific to certain traditions, which could have been simplified to focus on the most widely recognized terms. Overall, a solid effort in understanding the terminology associated with the Lord's Supper."
