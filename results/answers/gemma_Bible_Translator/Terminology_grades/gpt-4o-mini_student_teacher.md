## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 85.

While the student's answer provides a thorough list of alternative terms for "deacon," including biblical references, contemporary terms, and additional options, the reference answer from the teacher is more concise and directly relevant to the concern of identifying service roles within the church. The student's answer includes a wide range of creative and thoughtful alternatives, which demonstrates a deep understanding and exploration of the topic. However, the simplicity and directness of the teacher's reference answer may be more suitable for practical use within a church context.
