  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40%\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges that there are different ways to identify service roles within the church, it does not specifically address the concept of deacons or their various titles, which was the primary concern. The provided terms for \"deacon\" were more focused on emphasizing the role's significance and responsibility rather than exploring alternative names. Additionally, the given answer only touched upon a few possible descriptions without providing a comprehensive list like the one presented in the original response. To improve, future responses should delve deeper into the specific context of deacons and their various titles while addressing the concern of recognizing different service roles within the church."
