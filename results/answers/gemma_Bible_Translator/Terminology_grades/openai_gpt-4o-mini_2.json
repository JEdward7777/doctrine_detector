  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response not only provides alternative terms for \"deacon\" but also includes biblical references, contemporary terms, and additional options which show a deep understanding of the diverse ways to identify service roles within the church. The suggestions are thoughtful and align well with a Christian worldview that values serving, leadership, stewardship, and community engagement. This comprehensive approach merits a high grade."
