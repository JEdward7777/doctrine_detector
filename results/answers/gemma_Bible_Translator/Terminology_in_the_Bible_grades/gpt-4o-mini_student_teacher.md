Comment: The student provided relevant terms, but they did not specifically address the terms that are interchangeably used to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible as stated in the reference answer. Additionally, the terms 'Hebrews,' 'Israelites,' and 'Jews' were not included in the student's response. However, their explanation on Israel, Church, and Saints shows a good understanding of how different groups are considered God's chosen people from a Christian perspective.
