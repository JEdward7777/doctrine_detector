  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a valid point about the interchangeability of terms in the Bible regarding Hebrews, Israelites, and Jews. However, the initial response does not directly address the concern provided, which emphasizes understanding the context and audience of Biblical texts. A higher grade could be achieved by connecting the interchangeability of terms to how it impacts the comprehension of the context and audience in Biblical interpretation."
