However, the response does not directly address the distinctions between 'Israel' (physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), 'Church' (spiritual descendants of Abraham through faith in Jesus Christ), and 'Saints' (those made holy by God through faith in Jesus Christ). Connecting these concepts with the given concern would have improved the response."
