  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of why putting God to the test is considered wrong from a Christian worldview. They explored various aspects including God's character, faithfulness, sovereignty, spiritual pride, and purpose, all of which align well with the teacher's reference answer. The biblical references provided also support their points effectively. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept and effectively addresses the concern raised. Great job!"
