It accurately delineates the differences in source, purpose, consequences, and biblical examples. The answer is well-structured and effectively highlights the doctrinal distinctions between these concepts. The only minor area for improvement could be providing additional scriptural references to further support the explanation. Overall, an excellent and doctrinally sound response."
