  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that clearly outlines the differences between testing and temptation from a biblical perspective. They effectively explained the origins, purposes, consequences, and contexts of testing and temptation, supported by relevant biblical examples. The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, demonstrating a solid understanding of the concepts.\n\nHowever, to enhance the response further, the student could have emphasized more on the aspect that God does not tempt individuals to sin, as mentioned in James 1:13. This addition would have strengthened the student's argument and provided a clearer distinction between testing, which God allows for growth, and temptation, which is a lure to sin.\n\nOverall, the student's response is excellent, but a minor improvement in highlighting God's role in temptation could have made it even stronger."
