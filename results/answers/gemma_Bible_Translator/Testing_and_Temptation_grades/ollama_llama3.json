  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response is excellent in differentiating between testing and temptation, providing clear biblical examples, and highlighting the importance of understanding the distinction for spiritual discernment. The key differences between testing and temptation are well-articulated, including their sources, purposes, and consequences. The biblical examples provided further illustrate the distinct nature of these concepts. One minor area for improvement is that some of the points could be more explicitly linked to specific biblical passages or verses to add even more authority and clarity. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern of differentiating between testing and temptation in a biblical context."
