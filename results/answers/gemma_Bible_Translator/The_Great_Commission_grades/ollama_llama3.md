## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The command Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven is found in **Matthew 28:18-20**:

> "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, until the end of the age."

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The student accurately summarizes the command given by Jesus to His disciples, which is the main point of the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20). They correctly identify the key elements of making disciples, including baptism and teaching obedience to everything commanded. The only minor area for improvement is that the response could benefit from a bit more depth or analysis regarding the significance and implications of this commission in the context of spreading Christianity.

Comment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the Great Commission and its importance in Christian mission. However, it would be even stronger if it explored further what this command means for us today, such as how we can practically apply it in our lives and ministry.
