## [Answer](../The_Messiah.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Jesus and Christ are two names for the same divine person in Christianity.**

* **Jesus** is the common name used in the New Testament for the central figure of Christianity, who is believed to be the Son of God.
* **Christ** is a title that refers to the anointed one, the Messiah, who is foretold in the Old Testament.

Both terms are used interchangeably in the Bible to refer to the same person.

**The connection between the two terms is based on:**

* **Prophetic prophecies:** The Old Testament prophecies foretold that the Messiah would be anointed by the Holy Spirit (Psalm 2:6-7).
* **Jesus' anointing:** Jesus was anointed by the Holy Spirit at his baptism (Luke 3:22).
* **Early Church usage:** The early Church fathers used both terms to refer to Jesus Christ.

**Therefore, "Jesus" and "Christ" are two names for the same divine person, representing his divine identity and his role as the Messiah.**
