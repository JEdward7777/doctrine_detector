It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus as the anointed one and the Messiah, highlighting his divine nature as God's Son. The reference to biblical prophecies, Jesus's anointing, and early Church usage strengthens the argument. Overall, this response aligns well with a Christian worldview on Jesus's identity and role as the Messiah."
