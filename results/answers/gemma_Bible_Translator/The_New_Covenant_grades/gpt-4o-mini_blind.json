  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid explanation of the concept of God writing His law on the hearts of believers in the New Covenant. The Biblical basis is adequately referenced with key verses from Romans and Jeremiah. The interpretation emphasizes the transformative nature of this process and rightly highlights the shift from external to internal obedience. The implications drawn out from this understanding are well articulated, reflecting a deep grasp of the topic. However, to enhance the answer, further elaboration could be given on how this internal transformation impacts the believer's daily walk with God and empowers them to live out their faith in practical ways. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
