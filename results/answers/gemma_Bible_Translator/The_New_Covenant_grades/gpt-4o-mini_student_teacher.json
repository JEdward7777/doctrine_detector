  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful explanation of the concept of God writing His law on the people's hearts in the New Covenant. They supported their answer with relevant biblical references and offered a comprehensive interpretation of the implications and understanding of this concept. The student effectively conveyed the idea of inner transformation and a deeper relationship with God resulting from this internalization of His laws. This response aligns well with a Christian worldview perspective on the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant."
