  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive analysis of the concept of God writing His law on believers' hearts in the New Covenant, supported by relevant biblical references. The interpretation is clear and aligns well with Christian teachings. The implications and understanding of inner transformation and relationship with God are well-explained. The only minor improvement could be explicitly addressing the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant in more depth."
