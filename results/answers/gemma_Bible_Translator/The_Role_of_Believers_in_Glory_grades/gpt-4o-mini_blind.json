  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid biblical understanding of glorification with Christ according to the New Testament. The student effectively references relevant biblical texts to support their points and explains the meaning of glorification in a clear and doctrinally sound manner. The implications for believers are well articulated, and the conclusion summarizes the key points effectively. One suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the role of justification through faith in Christ as the basis for glorification. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
