  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of glorification with Christ, highlighting the transformative aspects of being united with Jesus in His resurrection and eternal glory. The inclusion of biblical texts (Philippians 2:9-11, Romans 8:18, and 1 Corinthians 13:12) to support this concept is also commendable.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by exploring the implications of glorification more thoroughly, particularly in terms of its connection to hope and perseverance. While the conclusion does touch on these aspects, a more nuanced discussion would strengthen the overall response.\n\nThe concern about understanding the future promise of glory for believers is well-addressed, as the response provides a clear explanation of what glorification entails and how it relates to the believer's union with Christ. The inclusion of biblical texts also helps to underscore this concept.\n\nOverall, while there is room for improvement, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the biblical doctrine of glorification and its significance for believers' hope and perseverance."
