The New Testament teaches that believers will be glorified with Christ when He returns in glory. This glorious transformation is a future event that awaits all who follow Christ as their Lord and Savior.

**Biblical Texts:**

* "Therefore God also has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord." (Philippians 2:9-11)
* "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed to us." (Romans 8:18)
* "Then shall we know as we are known." (1 Corinthians 13:12)

* **Eternal life:** Glorification is the guarantee of eternal life with God.
* **Divine union:** Believers can experience a sense of union with Christ even in this life, as they are united with him in spirit.

**Conclusion:**

Glorification with Christ is a fundamental belief of Christianity and is a future event that will bring immense joy and transformation to believers. It is a promise that sustains hope, encourages perseverance, and connects believers to Christ in a profound way.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response demonstrates a good understanding of glorification with Christ, highlighting the transformative aspects of being united with Jesus in His resurrection and eternal glory. The inclusion of biblical texts (Philippians 2:9-11, Romans 8:18, and 1 Corinthians 13:12) to support this concept is also commendable.

However, the response could be improved by exploring the implications of glorification more thoroughly, particularly in terms of its connection to hope and perseverance. While the conclusion does touch on these aspects, a more nuanced discussion would strengthen the overall response.

The concern about understanding the future promise of glory for believers is well-addressed, as the response provides a clear explanation of what glorification entails and how it relates to the believer's union with Christ. The inclusion of biblical texts also helps to underscore this concept.

Overall, while there is room for improvement, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the biblical doctrine of glorification and its significance for believers' hope and perseverance.
