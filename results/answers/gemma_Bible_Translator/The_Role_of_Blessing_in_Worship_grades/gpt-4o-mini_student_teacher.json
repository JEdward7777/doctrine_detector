  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that thoroughly explores the relationship between blessings and worship in a Christian context. They have effectively highlighted the similarities between blessing and praising God, supported by biblical examples, and connected these actions to expressing gratitude, trust, and alignment with God's will. However, the reference answer from the teacher simplifies the relationship to a more concise explanation, which the student's response could have aligned with more closely to match the reference."
