The response effectively demonstrates how Jesus' sacrifice brings ultimate cleansing. However, it would have been strengthened by including more explicit references to the relationship between Old Testament cleansing practices, such as the sacrificial system, and the fulfillment of these practices in Christ's redemptive work in the New Testament. This connection is vital in understanding the continuity and fulfillment of God's plan of salvation throughout the Bible."
