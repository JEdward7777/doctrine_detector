  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of God's selection process and the implications for the Christian community, drawing from examples of Moses and David. The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of divine call, obedience, specific circumstances, and God's ultimate purpose and glory in choosing individuals. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern raised in the question, which emphasizes recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders. The student's response, while informative and well-structured, could benefit from a more direct alignment with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
