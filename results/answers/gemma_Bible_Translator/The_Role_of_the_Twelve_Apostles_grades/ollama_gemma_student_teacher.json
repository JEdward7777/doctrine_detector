While this additional information is valuable, it slightly deviates from the reference answer's specific focus.\n* The conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly linking the apostles' significance to their role in continuing Jesus' teachings and establishing Christianity.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of the twelve apostles within Christian belief and ministry."
