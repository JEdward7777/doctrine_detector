I would grade this response as 80.

The response provides some good points about the apostles' significance, such as their role in continuing Jesus' teachings after His ascension. However, it lacks the depth and breadth of understanding demonstrated in the given answer. The response only touches on a few aspects of the apostles' importance, whereas the provided answer explores six different reasons why the twelve apostles were significant.

The concern was to recognize the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. While the response mentions that they were chosen by Jesus to continue His teachings, it does not fully acknowledge the apostles' role in spreading the Gospel, their doctrinal authority, or their spiritual leadership, which are all important aspects of their significance.

Overall, while the response shows some understanding of the apostles' importance, it could be improved by providing more details and exploring more reasons why they were significant.
