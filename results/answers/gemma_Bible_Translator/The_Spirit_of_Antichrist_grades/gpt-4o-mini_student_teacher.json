They referenced relevant biblical passages, explained key characteristics, presented different interpretations, and offered Christian perspectives on the topic. However, the answer focused more on the future appearance of the antichrist rather than the general spirit of antichrist that currently exists in the world as mentioned in the reference answer. To align with a Christian worldview, it is important for Christians to recognize and combat the present spirit of antichrist in addition to being aware of its potential future embodiment."
