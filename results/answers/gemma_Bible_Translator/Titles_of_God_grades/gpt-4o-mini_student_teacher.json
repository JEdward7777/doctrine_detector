  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that refer to God's power and might, which aligns with the concern of enhancing understanding of God's character. However, the specific title 'Almighty' was not directly included in the student's list. While the student has demonstrated knowledge of various titles emphasizing God's power, the key title 'Almighty' was not explicitly mentioned, and this slightly detracts from the accuracy of the response."
