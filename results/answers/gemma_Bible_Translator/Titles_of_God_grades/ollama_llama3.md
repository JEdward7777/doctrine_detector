Here are some of the titles used in the Bible that refer to God as "Almighty":

**Old Testament:**

* **Omnipotent:** This term emphasizes God's unlimited power and ability to do anything. (Psalm 139:16, Isaiah 40:15)
* **Mighty One:** This title highlights God's immense strength and power. (Daniel 7:27, Judges 5:11)
* **Strong and Mighty:** This phrase emphasizes God's immeasurable power and sovereignty. (1 Samuel 17:45, Zephaniah 3:19)
* **Eternal Strength:** This title refers to God's unchanging and unfailing power that sustains all things. (Habakkuk 3:19, Nehemiah 8:6)

**New Testament:**

* **Mighty God:** This title emphasizes God's divine power and authority. (2 Timothy 1:17)
* **Everlasting Power:** This emphasizes God's unchanging and eternal strength. (Philippians 4:13)
* **Lord of Hosts:** This title highlights God's control over all creation and his immense power. (Psalm 24:10)

**Other significant titles:**

* **The Almighty:** This is a direct translation of the Hebrew word "kabod," which signifies God's greatness, power, and glory. (2 Samuel 7:22)
* **The Prince of Peace:** This title emphasizes God's ultimate authority and peace-giving power. (Isaiah 9:6)

These titles highlight various aspects of God's immense power and sovereignty. They emphasize his unlimited ability to do anything, his immense strength and might, and his unchanging and eternal power.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 85.

The response provides a comprehensive list of titles that refer to God as "Almighty" from both the Old and New Testaments, along with some explanations of their significance. This shows a good understanding of Scripture and its relevance to the concern about recognizing God's character.

However, I would deduct points because the response does not directly address the provided answer. While it mentions some titles that refer to God as "Almighty", it does not provide an exact match with the given list ("Almighty God", "God Almighty", "Lord Almighty", and "Lord God Almighty"). Instead, it provides a broader range of titles that highlight God's power and sovereignty.

Despite this limitation, the response still demonstrates a good grasp of biblical concepts and their application to understanding God's character. With some refinement to address the specific concern and answer, this response could be even more effective in recognizing and applying these titles to our understanding of God's character.
