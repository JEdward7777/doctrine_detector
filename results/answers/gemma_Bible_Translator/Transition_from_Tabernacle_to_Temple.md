## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle due to several factors:

**1. Fulfillment of the Purpose:**

* The tabernacle was a temporary dwelling place for God among the Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness.
* Its purpose was to facilitate worship and provide a sense of God's presence.
* Once the Israelites settled in the Promised Land, a permanent dwelling place was needed.

**2. Construction of the Temple:**

* Around 1000 BC, David was instructed by the prophet Nathan to build a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and the presence of God.
* This temple would be a more majestic and permanent structure than the tabernacle.

**3. Tabernacle Became Unnecessary:**

* The establishment of the temple rendered the tabernacle redundant.
* The temple housed the Ark of the Covenant, which was the primary object of worship in the tabernacle.

**4. Temporary Nature of the Tabernacle:**

* The tabernacle was intended as a temporary dwelling place.
* Its purpose was to serve the Israelites during their nomadic life, not as a permanent solution.

**5. God's Promises:**

* God had promised the Israelites a land of their own, and with that, a permanent dwelling place.
* The completion of the temple fulfilled that promise.
