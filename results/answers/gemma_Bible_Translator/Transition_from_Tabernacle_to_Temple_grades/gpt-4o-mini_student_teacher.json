  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer addressing various factors that led to the Israelites stopping the use of the tabernacle. They accurately mentioned the purpose of the tabernacle, the construction of the temple, and the fulfillment of God's promises. However, there was some unnecessary detail and interpretation beyond the core concern of understanding the transition in worship practices. The reference answer, while more concise, focused directly on the specific question asked, giving it a higher grade."
