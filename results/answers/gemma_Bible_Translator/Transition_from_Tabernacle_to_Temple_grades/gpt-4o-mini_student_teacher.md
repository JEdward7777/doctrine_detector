## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle due to several factors:

**1. Fulfillment of the Purpose:**

* The tabernacle was a temporary dwelling place for God among the Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness.
* Its purpose was to facilitate worship and provide a sense of God's presence.
* Once the Israelites settled in the Promised Land, a permanent dwelling place was needed.

**2. Construction of the Temple:**

* Around 1000 BC, David was instructed by the prophet Nathan to build a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and the presence of God.
* This temple would be a more majestic and permanent structure than the tabernacle.

**3. Tabernacle Became Unnecessary:**

* The establishment of the temple rendered the tabernacle redundant.
* The temple housed the Ark of the Covenant, which was the primary object of worship in the tabernacle.

**4. Temporary Nature of the Tabernacle:**

* The tabernacle was intended as a temporary dwelling place.
* Its purpose was to serve the Israelites during their nomadic life, not as a permanent solution.

**5. God's Promises:**

* God had promised the Israelites a land of their own, and with that, a permanent dwelling place.
* The completion of the temple fulfilled that promise.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer addressing various factors that led to the Israelites stopping the use of the tabernacle. They accurately mentioned the purpose of the tabernacle, the construction of the temple, and the fulfillment of God's promises. However, there was some unnecessary detail and interpretation beyond the core concern of understanding the transition in worship practices. The reference answer, while more concise, focused directly on the specific question asked, giving it a higher grade.
