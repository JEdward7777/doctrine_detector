## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle due to several factors:

**1. Fulfillment of the Purpose:**

* The tabernacle was a temporary dwelling place for God among the Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness.
* Its purpose was to facilitate worship and provide a sense of God's presence.
* Once the Israelites settled in the Promised Land, a permanent dwelling place was needed.

**2. Construction of the Temple:**

* Around 1000 BC, David was instructed by the prophet Nathan to build a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and the presence of God.
* This temple would be a more majestic and permanent structure than the tabernacle.

**3. Tabernacle Became Unnecessary:**

* The establishment of the temple rendered the tabernacle redundant.
* The temple housed the Ark of the Covenant, which was the primary object of worship in the tabernacle.

**4. Temporary Nature of the Tabernacle:**

* The tabernacle was intended as a temporary dwelling place.
* Its purpose was to serve the Israelites during their nomadic life, not as a permanent solution.

**5. God's Promises:**

* God had promised the Israelites a land of their own, and with that, a permanent dwelling place.
* The completion of the temple fulfilled that promise.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a clear and concise overview of the reasons why the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle, including its temporary nature, the construction of the temple, and God's promises. It also correctly identifies the significance of the Ark of the Covenant being housed in the temple, which was the primary object of worship in the tabernacle.

The response does a good job of explaining the transition from the tabernacle to the temple, highlighting the fulfillment of God's promise for a permanent dwelling place and the redundancy of the tabernacle. The only area for improvement is that it could have explored more deeply why the tabernacle was intended as a temporary dwelling place and how this reflects God's character and purposes.

Overall, the response provides a clear and well-organized explanation of the transition from the tabernacle to the temple, demonstrating a good understanding of the concern.
