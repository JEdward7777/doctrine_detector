# Question [Transition from Tabernacle to Temple](../../../questions/Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md)
Why did the Israelites stop using the tabernacle?

# Correct Answer
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle when the temple was built in Jerusalem by Solomon, which became a permanent place of worship.

# Stated Concern
Understanding the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple.

# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle due to several factors:

**1. Fulfillment of the Purpose:**

* The tabernacle was a temporary dwelling place for God among the Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness.
* Its purpose was to facilitate worship and provide a sense of God's presence.
* Once the Israelites settled in the Promised Land, a permanent dwelling place was needed.

**2. Construction of the Temple:**

* Around 1000 BC, David was instructed by the prophet Nathan to build a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and the presence of God.
* This temple would be a more majestic and permanent structure than the tabernacle.

**3. Tabernacle Became Unnecessary:**

* The establishment of the temple rendered the tabernacle redundant.
* The temple housed the Ark of the Covenant, which was the primary object of worship in the tabernacle.

**4. Temporary Nature of the Tabernacle:**

* The tabernacle was intended as a temporary dwelling place.
* Its purpose was to serve the Israelites during their nomadic life, not as a permanent solution.

**5. God's Promises:**

* God had promised the Israelites a land of their own, and with that, a permanent dwelling place.
* The completion of the temple fulfilled that promise.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of why the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple occurred, emphasizing key factors such as the fulfillment of purpose, construction of the temple, the temporary nature of the tabernacle, and God's promises to the Israelites. However, it could have included more specific references to biblical passages to further strengthen the Christian perspective on this transition.
