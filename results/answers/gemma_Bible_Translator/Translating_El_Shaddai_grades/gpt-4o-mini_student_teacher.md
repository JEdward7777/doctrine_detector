Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for 'El Shaddai' in various languages, considering both literal translations, theological equivalents, and cultural adaptations. However, the concern was to ensure accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages. The teacher's reference answer emphasized simplicity and phonetic alignment in translation, which the student's answer did not fully adhere to. While the student's answer was thorough, it could have been improved by focusing on maintaining the simplicity and phonetic essence of the original name, as highlighted in the reference answer.
