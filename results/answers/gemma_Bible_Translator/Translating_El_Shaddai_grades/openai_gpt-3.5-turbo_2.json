  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-researched exploration of translating 'El Shaddai' into different languages, considering literal, theological, and cultural aspects. The considerations and important notes show an understanding of the importance of accurately representing God's name across various cultures and languages. The response could have further emphasized the significance of preserving the theological depth and richness of 'El Shaddai' in translations, but overall, it is comprehensive and well-developed."
