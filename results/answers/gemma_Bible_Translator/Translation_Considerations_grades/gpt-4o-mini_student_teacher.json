  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-structured answer that highlights the theological significance, literal translation, cultural context, continuity of tradition, theological understanding, and inspiration and encouragement related to retaining the terms 'Zion' and 'Daughter' in Biblical translations. The response effectively conveys the importance of these terms in maintaining theological accuracy, literary integrity, and continuity of tradition. However, the answer could have been improved by directly stating the point regarding the rich figurative meanings and connection to Biblical heritage and teachings, as emphasized in the reference answer."
