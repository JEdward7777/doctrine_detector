  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of suggested translations for the phrase \"image of God\" when applied to humans and Jesus. They have effectively discussed the significance of each translation, demonstrating a good understanding of the theological implications. The explanations provided are clear and well-reasoned, aligning well with a Christian worldview. One suggestion for improvement would be to delve deeper into the scriptural basis for each translation to strengthen the theological argument further."
