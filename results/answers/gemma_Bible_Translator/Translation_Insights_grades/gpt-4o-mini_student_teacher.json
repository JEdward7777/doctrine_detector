They considered different aspects such as clarity for different audiences, avoiding cultural bias, emphasis on spiritual qualities, and theological depth. However, the answer could be improved by directly addressing the translations suggested in the reference answer provided by the teacher and comparing the student's suggestions with those specific translations. This would have shown a deeper engagement with the specific translations related to humans and Jesus, thus enhancing the overall analysis."
