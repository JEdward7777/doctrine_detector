Comment:

While the response provides some relevant translations, it primarily focuses on suggesting new phrases rather than exploring the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. The concern emphasizes the importance of considering how different translations can affect our comprehension of scripture, but this answer does not fully address that concern.

The response does attempt to apply the concept to both humans and Jesus, which is a positive step. However, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into the significance of translation choices in understanding biblical teachings. A more comprehensive response might explore how different translations can influence our interpretation of scripture, or discuss potential pitfalls or biases associated with certain translations.

To improve this grade, the answer could provide more insight into the impact of translation choices on our comprehension of biblical truths and consider alternative perspectives or nuances that arise from various translations.
