  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured answer that addresses various historical, linguistic, and theological reasons for using 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' in Bible translations. The student also acknowledges the balance between accuracy and accessibility in translation. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the concern of maintaining reverence for God's name in the translation of sacred texts. Additionally, the student could have highlighted the significance of the Jewish tradition of not pronouncing 'Yahweh' as a key reason for using 'LORD' in translations."
