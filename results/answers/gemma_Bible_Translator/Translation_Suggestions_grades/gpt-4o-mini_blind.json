The explanations provided for each translation demonstrate an understanding of the source and nature of biblical zeal. The use of phrases like \"Burning with Spirit\" and \"Consumed by Purpose\" effectively captures the spiritual and purpose-driven aspects of zeal. Overall, a well-thought-out and insightful answer."
