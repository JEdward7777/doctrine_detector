  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of alternative translations for 'to be zealous', each with detailed explanations that reflect the biblical meaning of zeal in various contexts. The translations offered by the student align well with the Christian understanding of zeal and demonstrate a deep understanding of the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith. The student's response effectively explores different nuances of zeal, connecting them to spiritual aspects and the Christian worldview. Great effort in providing thoughtful and relevant translations."
