The suggested translations not only capture the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith but also emphasize the source of zeal as rooted in the Holy Spirit and driven by divine energy. The additional insights into different aspects of zeal, such as passion, dedication, purpose, justice, service, and motivation, further enhance understanding and appreciation of the concept within a Christian context."
