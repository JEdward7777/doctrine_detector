  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful exploration of alternative translations for 'covenant faithfulness,' considering various aspects and implications of each translation. The student demonstrated a deep understanding of the concept and presented clear and well-developed explanations for each alternative. However, the student's answer did not directly align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which suggested alternative translations such as 'faithful love,' 'loyal, committed love,' and 'loving dependability.' While the student's response was comprehensive and well-organized, it deviated from the specific translations mentioned in the reference answer."
