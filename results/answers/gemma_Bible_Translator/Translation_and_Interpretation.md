**Translating 'Lord' in Theological and Non-Theological Contexts:**

**1. References to God:**

* The translation of "Lord" in references to God emphasizes his divinity, sovereignty, and majesty. 
* Words like "Lord God," "Lord Jesus Christ," or "Lord Almighty" highlight his divine nature and power. 
* Translators often use words like "Lord," "Divine," or "Sovereign" to convey these concepts.

**2. References to Ordinary People:**

* In contexts referring to ordinary people, the translation of "Lord" is more informal and respectful. 
* It implies authority and leadership, but not in a divine or supernatural sense. 
* Words like "Lord Mayor," "Lord CEO," or "Lord Scholar" convey a position of authority or leadership in the human realm.

**Distinction in Meaning:**

The translation of "Lord" in theological contexts differs significantly from its usage in non-theological contexts. 

* **Theological:** Refers to God as the supreme being, worthy of worship and adoration.
* **Non-Theological:** Indicates a position of authority or leadership, but not in a divine or supernatural sense.

**Examples of Translational Distinctions:**

* **The Bible:** "Lord God" (divine), "Lord Jesus Christ" (divine)
* **Modern Usage:** "Lord Mayor" (human leader), "Lord CEO" (human leader)

**Principles of Translation:**

* Accuracy: Translating the original word correctly in its intended meaning.
* Clarity: Ensuring that the translation is clear and understandable.
