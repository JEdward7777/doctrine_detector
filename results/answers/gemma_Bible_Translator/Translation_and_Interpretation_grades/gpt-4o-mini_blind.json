  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the translation of \"Lord\" in theological and non-theological contexts. It correctly highlights the differences in meaning and usage between references to God and ordinary people. The principles of translation mentioned are relevant and important. However, the response could be enhanced by including scriptural references or examples from Christian theological literature to further support the explanation. Overall, a solid effort."
