  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the distinction between translating \"Lord\" in theological and non-theological contexts, and provides insightful examples, their answer lacks a direct reference to the capitalization of 'Lord' when referring to God as specified in the teacher's reference answer. This detail is crucial in understanding the reverence and respect shown to God in biblical translations. Encouraging the student to incorporate this specific detail next time will help further strengthen their response within a Christian worldview context."
