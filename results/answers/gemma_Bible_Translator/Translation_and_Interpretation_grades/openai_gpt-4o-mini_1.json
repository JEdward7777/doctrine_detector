  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how the term \"Lord\" is translated and interpreted in theological and non-theological contexts, considering both divine and human references. The principles of translation outlined are clear and relevant to the concern raised. However, the response could be strengthened by including more specific biblical examples to further illustrate the differences in translation and interpretation, especially in theological contexts. Overall, a well-reasoned and thoughtful analysis."
