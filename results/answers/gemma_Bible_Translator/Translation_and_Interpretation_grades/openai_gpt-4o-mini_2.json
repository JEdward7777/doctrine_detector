  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the translation of \"Lord\" in theological and non-theological contexts, emphasizing the importance of accurately conveying the intended meaning while maintaining respect for God and authority figures. The distinction between the divine usage of \"Lord\" and its human application is clearly articulated. The principles of translation highlighted are relevant and aligned with a Christian worldview. However, there could be a stronger integration of how proper translation and interpretation directly impact the understanding of Scripture and the nature of God, in relation to the provided concern. Additionally, connecting the implications of accurate translation to theological significance could further enhance the response."
