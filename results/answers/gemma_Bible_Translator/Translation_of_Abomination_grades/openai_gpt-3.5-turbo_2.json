  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a strong framework for context-sensitive translation of the term \"abomination,\" incorporating considerations of cultural sensitivity, theological understanding, and inclusive language. The suggested translations align well with the Christian worldview and the examples provided demonstrate an understanding of the nuances between literal and figurative uses of the term. The only area for improvement would be to provide a more direct correlation between the potential translations offered and their specific contexts within biblical passages for greater clarity."
