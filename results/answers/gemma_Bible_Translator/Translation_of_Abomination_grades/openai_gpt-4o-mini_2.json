It considers relevant factors such as cultural sensitivity, theological understanding, and inclusive language. The suggested translations align well with the concern of accurately conveying the severity of actions against God's laws. However, there could be more emphasis on the importance of maintaining consistency with other biblical translations to uphold the integrity of the text."
