  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough exploration of potential translations of 'truly' in Jesus' phrases, considering various nuances and implications. However, the translations offered do not align closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on accurately reflecting the specific translations suggested by the teacher and ensuring that the explanations provided are consistent with a Christian worldview on biblical translation and interpretation."
