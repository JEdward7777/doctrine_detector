* Spiritual rebirth involves being "born again" as children of God through faith in Jesus Christ.

* This signifies a deep and intimate connection with the Father, who loves and cares for his children.

**Biblical Examples:**

* **John 1:12:** "Whoever believes in him is 'born again,' not into the world, but to a new life."
* **2 Corinthians 5:17:** "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a 'new creation'; the old has gone, the new has come."
