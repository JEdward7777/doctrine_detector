Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of suggested translations for the term 'church' that reflect its meaning well. They demonstrated an understanding of the communal nature and spiritual significance of the church. However, their answer could be improved by focusing more on translations that specifically emphasize the inclusive nature of the church, as mentioned in the concern. The reference answer from the teacher highlighted translations like 'gathering together', 'assembly', or 'congregation' that ensure the term refers to all believers and not just a select group, which was missing in the student's response. Overall, a solid effort but could benefit from addressing the specific concern more directly.
