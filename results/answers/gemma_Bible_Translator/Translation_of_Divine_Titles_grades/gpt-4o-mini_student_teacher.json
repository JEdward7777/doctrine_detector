  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for 'Lord Yahweh' in various languages and considered important factors such as accuracy, equivalence, and theological understanding. The guidelines and additional notes show a good understanding of the significance of translating divine titles accurately. However, the reference answer from the teacher simplifies the translation to 'Lord God' or 'God who is the Lord,' stressing the importance of grammatical structure, which the student's response did not emphasize enough. A higher grade could be achieved by integrating more focus on the grammatical structures of the target languages in relation to conveying the meaning effectively."
