  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and thoughtful response with detailed explanations of the biblical meanings of 'Hades' and 'Sheol', along with appropriate translation options that respect these meanings. The student also considered additional factors such as context, clarity, accuracy, and relevance to the audience. While the translations provided are creative and reflective of the biblical concepts, they could be slightly improved by aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer, which emphasizes terms like 'the underworld' and 'the grave'. Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the biblical concepts and translation considerations, earning a commendable grade of 80."
