The emphasis on accuracy, clarity, cultural sensitivity, and theological truth aligns well with the concern of maintaining theological implications in translations. The only room for improvement would be to further elaborate on how the suggested translations specifically ensure accurate representation of the term's theological implications. Overall, it is a well-rounded and insightful analysis."
