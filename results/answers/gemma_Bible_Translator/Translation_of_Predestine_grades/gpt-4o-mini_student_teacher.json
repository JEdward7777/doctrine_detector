  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough list of suggested translations for the term \"predestined\" and highlighted the theological implications of each translation. The student also considered important factors such as context, audience, and accuracy in translation. However, the grade is slightly lower because the student did not include the teacher's reference answer, which could have been beneficial for comparison and analysis. Additionally, the student could have incorporated the teacher's translation suggestions into their list of translations to improve coherence and completeness."
