The emphasis on theological accuracy, cultural context, linguistic and theological equivalents, clarity, and context-specificity is commendable. The student's suggestions for potential translation options are well-reasoned and align with Christian teachings on spiritual leadership. Additionally, the inclusion of consulting with theologians, considering different Christian denominational views, and being mindful of sensitivities shows a comprehensive approach to the translation process. Overall, this is a thorough and well-rounded answer."
