  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of considerations for translating the term 'Rabbi' in various languages, touching on theological accuracy, cultural context, linguistic and theological equivalents, clarity, and context-specificity. However, the student's answer could be improved by explicitly addressing the concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The reference answer emphasizes the importance of respecting the significance of the title 'Rabbi' without diminishing Jesus' role as more than a mere schoolteacher, which is not directly addressed in the student's response. Encouraging the student to explicitly tie their considerations back to how Jesus' teaching role should be accurately represented in the translation would enhance the Christian worldview perspective in this context."
