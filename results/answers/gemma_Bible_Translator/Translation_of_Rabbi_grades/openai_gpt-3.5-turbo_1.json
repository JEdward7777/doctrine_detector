The potential options for translation are thoughtful and demonstrate a deep understanding of the nuances involved. The concern regarding accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith is addressed well, emphasizing the importance of respecting the title's significance. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific theological connections between the role of a Rabbi and Jesus within Christianity to further enhance the understanding of the significance of the translation."
