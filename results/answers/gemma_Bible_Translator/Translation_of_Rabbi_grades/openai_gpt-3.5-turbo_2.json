  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides thorough considerations for translating the term 'Rabbi' while taking into account theological accuracy, cultural context, linguistic and theological equivalents, clarity, context-specificity, potential options, and additional considerations. The emphasis on respecting the significance of the title without diminishing Jesus' role and conforming to the target language's norms is commendable. However, to improve the grade, a direct suggestion for a translation that accurately represents Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith could have been included."
