  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of considerations for translating the term 'Rabbi' into different languages, taking into account theological accuracy, cultural context, linguistic and theological equivalents, clarity, context-specificity, and potential options. The potential options presented for translation are well-reasoned and considerate of the different aspects of the role of a Rabbi. The additional considerations, such as consulting theologians and scholars and being mindful of potential sensitivities, demonstrate a comprehensive approach to translating the term. The concern about accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith is appropriately addressed in the context of finding a translation that respects the significance of the title while aligning with how teachers are addressed in the target language. Overall, the response shows a deep understanding of the Christian faith perspective and provides a strong framework for translating the term 'Rabbi' in a way that maintains theological accuracy and respect for Jesus' role."
