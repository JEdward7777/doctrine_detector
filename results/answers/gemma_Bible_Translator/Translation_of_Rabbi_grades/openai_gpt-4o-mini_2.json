The potential options presented were thoughtful and took into account various aspects of spiritual leadership. The recommendation to consult with theologians and scholars in both languages and to consider different denominational perspectives shows a commitment to accuracy and sensitivity. The specific concern regarding accurate representation of Jesus' teaching role was addressed by considering how teachers are typically addressed in the target language and avoiding implications that Jesus was merely a schoolteacher. This response demonstrated thoroughness and careful attention to maintaining the theological integrity of the translation within a Christian perspective."
