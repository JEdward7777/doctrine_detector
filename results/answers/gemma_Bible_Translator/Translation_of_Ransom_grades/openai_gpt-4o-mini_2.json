  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the term \"ransom\" in different languages, considering both literal translations, theological equivalents, and context-sensitive translations. The emphasis on accuracy, clarity, and theological consistency is commendable. The additional considerations for finding suitable substitutes in languages without a direct equivalent demonstrate careful attention to linguistic and cultural contexts. The response effectively addresses the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across different contexts from a Christian worldview perspective."
