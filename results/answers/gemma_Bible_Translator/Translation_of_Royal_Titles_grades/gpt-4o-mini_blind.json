  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages and includes considerations for theological accuracy. It acknowledges the importance of respecting the divine nature of the sovereign when choosing translations. The inclusion of Biblical references that highlight the authority and sovereignty of God is commendable. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more specific guidance on how to ensure theological accuracy in translation choices, such as referencing specific theological principles or doctrines. Additionally, incorporating examples of how certain translations may align or conflict with Christian beliefs would further enhance the theological analysis. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological exploration."
