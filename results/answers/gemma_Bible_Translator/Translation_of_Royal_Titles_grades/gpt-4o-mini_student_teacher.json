  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, which is helpful. However, the concern was to ensure accuracy and respect in translations in the context of biblical teachings. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency' when translating 'Your Majesty' to maintain appropriate respect. The student did not directly address this specific concern, impacting the grade. It is important to ensure that translations are not only accurate for the language but also align with biblical teachings on respect and reverence."
