  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive research and accurate translations of \"Your Majesty\" in various languages.\n* Consideration of theological accuracy and the divine nature of the sovereign.\n* Inclusion of biblical references to support the translation choices.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The suggestion that \"Your Majesty\" can be translated as \"your Highness\" or \"your Excellency\" lacks nuance and fails to capture the regal or divine nature of the title.\n* The absence of examples or citations for the proposed translations in non-European languages.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* Provide more specific examples or citations for the translations in different languages.\n* Further elaborate on the theological considerations and their relevance to the translation of such titles.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the linguistic and theological aspects of the translation challenge. However, the lack of examples and the generalizability of the suggested translations could be improved."
