  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe main strengths of this response are its comprehensive coverage of various languages, including African and Asian languages, which is not often seen in such responses. Additionally, it provides a clear consideration for theological accuracy, highlighting the importance of choosing translations that are respectful of the divine nature of the sovereign.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the response could be improved. Firstly, while it provides a range of translations, it does not explicitly discuss the potential issues with using \"your Highness\" or \"your Excellency\" as alternatives to \"Your Majesty\". This is particularly important in the context of biblical teachings, which emphasize the importance of respecting and honoring those in authority.\n\nSecondly, the response could benefit from more explicit engagement with biblical references and theological resources. While it mentions that the Bible uses phrases like \"Lord,\" \"King,\" and \"Sovereign\" to describe God's authority and sovereignty, it does not provide a detailed explanation of how these concepts relate to the translation of \"Your Majesty\".\n\nOverall, while this response is strong in terms of its linguistic scope and theological consideration, it could be improved by providing more explicit discussion of the potential issues with alternative translations and deeper engagement with biblical references and theological resources."
