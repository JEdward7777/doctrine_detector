  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of appropriate translations of \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, taking into account cultural nuances and considerations for accuracy and respect in addressing rulers. The inclusion of theological accuracy considerations and Biblical references adds depth to the response, aligning well with the concern of ensuring respectful translations in light of biblical teachings. However, it could have been strengthened by including specific theological insights related to titles and translations in the Christian context. Overall, a well-thought-out and informative response."
