  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of appropriate translations of \"Your Majesty\" in various languages and cultures. It also emphasizes the importance of theological accuracy and respect when choosing translations, drawing on biblical references to support the recommendations. The only room for improvement would be to include specific examples of how biblical teachings guide or inform the selection of these translations. Overall, a solid and well-reasoned answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
