  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of appropriate translations of \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, considering cultural nuances and theological accuracy. The emphasis on choosing translations that respect the divine nature of the sovereign aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, it could have been improved by providing more direct references to biblical teachings related to titles and honorifics. Overall, the response is well-researched and thoughtful in addressing the concern of accurate and respectful translations in alignment with biblical teachings."
