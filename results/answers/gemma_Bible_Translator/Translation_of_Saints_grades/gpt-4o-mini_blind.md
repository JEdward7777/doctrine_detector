## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Recommended Translation for "Saints":**

* **Holy people:** This emphasizes the holiness and righteousness of the saints.
* **Believers:** This focuses on their faith in Christ as the foundation of their salvation.
* **Disciples:** This highlights their commitment to following Christ's teachings.
* **Victorious Christians:** This emphasizes their triumph over sin and death through Christ's sacrifice.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Context and culture: The specific translation may vary depending on the context in which the term is used.
* Clarity and precision: The translation should be clear and accurate, conveying the intended meaning.
* Theological integrity: The translation should uphold Christian theological beliefs about the saints as glorified followers of Christ.

**Avoid:**

* "Saints" as a singular term, as it can suggest a hierarchy or exclusivity.
* Translations that equate the saints with angels or other spiritual beings.
* Translations that deny the resurrection and ascension of Christ.
