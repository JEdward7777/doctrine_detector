## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Recommended Translation for "Saints":**

* **Holy people:** This emphasizes the holiness and righteousness of the saints.
* **Believers:** This focuses on their faith in Christ as the foundation of their salvation.
* **Disciples:** This highlights their commitment to following Christ's teachings.
* **Victorious Christians:** This emphasizes their triumph over sin and death through Christ's sacrifice.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Context and culture: The specific translation may vary depending on the context in which the term is used.
* Clarity and precision: The translation should be clear and accurate, conveying the intended meaning.
* Theological integrity: The translation should uphold Christian theological beliefs about the saints as glorified followers of Christ.

**Avoid:**

* "Saints" as a singular term, as it can suggest a hierarchy or exclusivity.
* Translations that equate the saints with angels or other spiritual beings.
* Translations that deny the resurrection and ascension of Christ.

Grade: 88

Comment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful answer in recommending translations for the term "saints" that align with the specified concern of using inclusive language. They offered multiple alternatives with explanations that emphasize various aspects of Christian faith. However, the recommendations slightly deviate from the teacher's reference answer by including terms like "disciples" and "victorious Christians" which, although relevant, may not directly correspond to the term "saints" in all contexts. The additional considerations and avoidances provided also demonstrate a good understanding of the complexities involved in translation. Overall, a strong effort is evident, but some minor adjustments would align the response more closely with the specific concern outlined.
