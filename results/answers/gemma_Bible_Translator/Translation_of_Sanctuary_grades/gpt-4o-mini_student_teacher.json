  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured response addressing various aspects to consider when translating the term 'sanctuary' in modern texts. They demonstrated a good understanding of the need for contextual, theological, and cultural considerations. However, the student's answer lacked a direct reference to maintaining the original Biblical definition of sanctuary as a holy and sacred place, which was the key concern highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of preserving the Biblical meaning of terms in translations, especially in a Christian worldview, which the student's answer did not fully incorporate."
