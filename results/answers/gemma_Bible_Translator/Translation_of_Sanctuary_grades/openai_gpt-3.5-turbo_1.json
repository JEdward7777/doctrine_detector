  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides thorough and well-thought-out guidance on translating the term 'sanctuary' in modern texts, considering contextual, theological, semantic, clarity, accessibility, cultural sensitivity, expert consultation, and wider theological context factors. The suggested translations align with maintaining the term's original biblical meaning. The only slight improvement could be to explicitly address the concern regarding maintaining the term's original meaning within the specific guidance provided. Overall, an excellent and Christian worldview-aligned response."
