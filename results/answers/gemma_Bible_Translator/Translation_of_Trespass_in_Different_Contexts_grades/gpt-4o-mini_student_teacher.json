  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the implications of translating \"trespass\" within a Christian context, considering theological accuracy, cultural context, interpersonal implications, and clarity for different audiences. The recommendations offered by the student align well with the concern provided, showing a good understanding of the issue. However, the student could have directly addressed the concern by explicitly comparing the spiritual consequences emphasized by translating as \"sin\" and the potential downplaying of moral and relational impact by translating as \"breaking the rule.\" This direct comparison would have further strengthened the student's analysis and response."
