  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough evaluation of the implications of translating \"trespass\" and offers specific recommendations based on theological accuracy, cultural context, interpersonal implications, and clarity for non-theological audiences. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of accurately reflecting scriptural integrity and community values in church teachings. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or biblical references to bolster the argument. Overall, well done!"
