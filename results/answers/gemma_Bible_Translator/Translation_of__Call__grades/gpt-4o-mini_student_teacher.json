  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided thorough and thoughtful alternative translations that captured the nuances of calling upon Jesus' name in a biblical context. The translations aligned well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing aspects of confession, declaration, invocation, submission, and reliance on Jesus' name. The student also considered important factors such as context, audience, and accuracy in their analysis. The only improvement would be to also include the teacher's reference answer of \"you must name him,\" which emphasizes the act of assigning a name, to showcase a comprehensive understanding of the nuances in biblical language."
