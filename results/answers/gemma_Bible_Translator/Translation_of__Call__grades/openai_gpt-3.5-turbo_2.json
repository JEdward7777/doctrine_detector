  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough analysis of alternative translations of the phrase \"You must call his name\" in a Biblical context, considering nuances in meaning and theological implications. The concern regarding understanding biblical language and its impact on interpretation was addressed well. The response demonstrated a strong grasp of Christian terminology and theological concepts. However, the given answer suggesting the translation as \"you must name him\" could have been further expanded upon to tie it back to Christian beliefs and practices, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and confessing Jesus' name in a salvific context. Overall, a well-discussed response with room for slightly deeper theological exploration."
