The student effectively explains the differences in emphasis, such as God's sovereignty, love, and grace. The impact on understanding Scripture is well-analyzed, showing an understanding of theological shifts and their implications. The conclusion nicely sums up the evolution of translation and its theological reflections. The response could be strengthened by providing more specific scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a solid analysis with room for further depth and textual support."
