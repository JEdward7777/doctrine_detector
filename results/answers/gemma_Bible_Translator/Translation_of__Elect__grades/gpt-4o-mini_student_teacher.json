  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive comparison of the translation of 'elect' in older and modern English Bible versions, highlighting the theological implications and impact on understanding Scripture. The student effectively addressed the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God. However, the answer could have further emphasized the reader's understanding of their identity as God's people, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the response demonstrated a strong grasp of the topic and effectively analyzed the differences in translations."
