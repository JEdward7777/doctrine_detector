  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God, particularly with regards to different translations of the term \"elect\". The comparison between older and modern English Bible versions provides valuable insight into how theological understandings have shifted over time. The discussion also thoughtfully considers the implications of these changes for our understanding of Scripture.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because this response does not directly address the concern about clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God. While it provides some insight into the significance of different translations, it could be more explicit in exploring how these differences impact our understanding of this concept.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of biblical translation and its implications for theological interpretation. With some further attention to directly addressing the concern, it could be even stronger!"
