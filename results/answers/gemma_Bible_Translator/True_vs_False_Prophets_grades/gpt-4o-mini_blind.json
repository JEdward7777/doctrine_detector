The points are grounded in scriptural principles and highlight the importance of doctrinal correctness and spiritual discernment. The emphasis on consistency with Biblical teaching, fulfillment of prophecy, demonstrating the fruit of the Spirit, clarity in communication, humility, lifestyle consistency, seeking guidance from spiritual leaders, and above all, reliance on prayer and God's guidance are all excellent criteria for evaluating prophets. The only suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the centrality of Jesus Christ as the ultimate standard by which to judge all prophetic claims. Overall, an excellent and doctrinally sound response."
