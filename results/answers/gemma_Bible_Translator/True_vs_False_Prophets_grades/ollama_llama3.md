## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The answer addresses the concern by providing some practical ways to discern true prophetic voices from false ones, which aligns with the biblical teaching of testing spirits (1 John 4:1-3) and examining the fruit of one's ministry (Matthew 7:15-20). The response emphasizes the importance of comparing prophetic messages with God's Word (Scripture) and evaluating the nature of their teachings.

However, the answer could be more comprehensive by addressing additional aspects listed in the original criteria, such as:

* Consistent lifestyle: Does the prophet's life reflect the values and principles they teach?
* Consensus among believers: Do multiple reliable sources confirm the prophet's messages?
* Seeking guidance from spiritual leaders: Have respected leaders examined and verified the prophet's teachings?

Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific examples or illustrations to support its claims. Nevertheless, it provides a solid foundation for discerning true prophetic voices and deserves an 80% grade.

Comment: The answer demonstrates a good understanding of biblical principles and provides some helpful tips for discerning true prophecy. However, it could be more comprehensive by addressing additional aspects and providing more specific examples or illustrations to support its claims.
