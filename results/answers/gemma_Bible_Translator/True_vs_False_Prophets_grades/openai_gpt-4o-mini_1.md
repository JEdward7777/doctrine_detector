Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a good foundation for discerning true prophetic voices by emphasizing alignment with God's Word, the nature of teachings, and the fruits of their ministry. However, it could be strengthened by incorporating more specific criteria from the provided Christian worldview perspective, such as referencing Scripture, the fruit of the Spirit, and the emphasis on humility and serving others. A more detailed explanation with explicit connections to Christian principles would enhance the discernment process in distinguishing true prophetic voices.
