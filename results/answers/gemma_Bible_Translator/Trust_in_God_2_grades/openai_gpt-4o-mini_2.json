However, the response could be improved by elaborating more on the additional aspects highlighted in the provided Christian teachings such as repentance, forgiveness, submission to Jesus' lordship, faith, and experiencing transformation. Expanding on these further would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the foundation of Christian faith in relation to trust."
