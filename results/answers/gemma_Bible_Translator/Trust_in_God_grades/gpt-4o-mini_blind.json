  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and thorough comparison between hope in God and mere wishing, highlighting key theological distinctions. The answer appropriately uses biblical examples to support the points made and concludes with a strong summary emphasizing the supernatural nature of hope in God. The only area for improvement would be to include more direct scriptural references to support the assertions made throughout the response. Overall, a well-written and insightful answer."
