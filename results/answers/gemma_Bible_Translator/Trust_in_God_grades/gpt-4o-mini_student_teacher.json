  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and well-thought-out explanation of the difference between hope in God and mere wishing, covering various aspects such as basis, duration, confidence, action, and connection to God. The biblical examples and conclusion also add depth to the response. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused directly on the core difference between hope in God and wishing, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the student's response is comprehensive, it slightly deviates from the specific concern of distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation and wishful thinking."
