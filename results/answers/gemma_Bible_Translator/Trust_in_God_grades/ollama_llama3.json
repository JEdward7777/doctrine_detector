  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response provides a clear and thorough explanation of the differences between hope in God and mere wishing, using scriptural examples to support its claims. It effectively addresses the concern by distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking, highlighting the supernatural nature of hope in God. The writer also uses specific biblical examples to illustrate the contrast between hope in God and human wishes.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that some of the points could be more explicitly connected to the original answer and concern. For example, while the response does discuss the differences between hope in God and wishing, it could be made clearer how these distinctions relate to the concept of having hope in God as a confident trust in God's faithfulness.\n\nComment: This is an excellent response that provides a detailed and biblically-grounded explanation of the difference between hope in God and mere wishing. The writer's use of scriptural examples adds depth and authority to their argument, making it a compelling and persuasive case for the distinct nature of hope in God."
