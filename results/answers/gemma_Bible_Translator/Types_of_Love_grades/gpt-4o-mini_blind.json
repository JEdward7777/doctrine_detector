  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the different forms of love within a Christian context, including brotherly love, romantic love, and agape love. They have effectively highlighted the biblical foundation for each form of love and how they relate to the overall biblical definition of love. Additionally, the student has emphasized the importance of all forms of love in reflecting God's character and promoting unity within communities. The only improvement could be to further integrate specific biblical references to support the points made, which would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
