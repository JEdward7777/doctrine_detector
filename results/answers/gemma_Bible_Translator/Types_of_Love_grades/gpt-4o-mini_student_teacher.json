  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive understanding of different forms of love in the biblical context, emphasizing brotherly love, romantic love, and agape love. They have effectively linked these forms of love to the biblical definition, highlighting key aspects such as selflessness, sacrificial nature, unity, and origin from God. Additionally, the student acknowledges the importance of all forms of love in reflecting God's character and fostering relationships. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern of ensuring that all forms align with a biblical worldview, which the reference answer specifically mentions. Nonetheless, the student has demonstrated a strong knowledge of the topic and effectively connected the discussion to a Christian worldview."
