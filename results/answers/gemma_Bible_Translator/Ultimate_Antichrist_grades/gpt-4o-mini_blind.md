## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: While it is commendable that the student is cautious in avoiding speculation and conspiracy theories, the response lacks doctrinal clarity. Providing a scripturally accurate answer based on the teachings of the Bible would have been more beneficial in this context. It is important to acknowledge the biblical figure without falling into harmful or divisive speculation.
