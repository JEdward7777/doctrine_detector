The inclusion of examples like sacrificing humans, idol worship, and sexual sins aligns well with the concerns outlined in scripture. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance for Christians to be aware of actions that go against God's will as outlined in the Bible. Great job on connecting the given answer to the specific concern!"
