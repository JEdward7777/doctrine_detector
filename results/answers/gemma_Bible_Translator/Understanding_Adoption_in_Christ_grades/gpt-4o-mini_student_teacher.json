  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful explanation of what it means to be adopted as a child of God according to Ephesians 1:5. They highlighted key aspects such as forgiveness, new identity, divine affection, eternal relationship, full acceptance, and divine empowerment, demonstrating a deep understanding of the spiritual significance of adoption in the Christian faith. The response beautifully captures the essence of God's unconditional love and the privileges bestowed upon believers through adoption. The grade is slightly lower than perfect as the student's answer could have directly tied the concept of being co-heirs with Christ to the adoption process, as mentioned in the reference answer."
