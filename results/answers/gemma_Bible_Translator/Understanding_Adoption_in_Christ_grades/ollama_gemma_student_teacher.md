## [Answer](../Understanding_Adoption_in_Christ.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Ephesians 1:5 teaches that being adopted as a child of God means:**

* **Initial Forgiveness:** God's love for us is so great that he offers us complete forgiveness of our sins through Jesus Christ (verse 7). 


* **New Identity:** We are no longer slaves to sin and death, but are now God's children, heirs to his eternal kingdom (verse 18). 


* **Divine Affection:** God lovingly welcomes us into his family and calls us his own (verse 5). 


* **Eternal Relationship:** This adoption is not temporary but is permanent and eternal, lasting throughout our lives (verse 19).


* **Full Acceptance:** God accepts us unconditionally, not because of anything we have done, but because of his love for us (verse 6).


* **Divine Empowerment:** As God's children, we receive the power of the Holy Spirit to live a new life (verse 19).


**In essence, being adopted as a child of God means experiencing God's unconditional love, receiving forgiveness for our sins, and being welcomed into his family with all the privileges and responsibilities that come with it.**
