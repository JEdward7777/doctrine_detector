# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Ephesians 1:5 teaches that being adopted as a child of God means:**

* **Initial Forgiveness:** God's love for us is so great that he offers us complete forgiveness of our sins through Jesus Christ (verse 7). 


* **New Identity:** We are no longer slaves to sin and death, but are now God's children, heirs to his eternal kingdom (verse 18). 


* **Divine Affection:** God lovingly welcomes us into his family and calls us his own (verse 5). 


* **Eternal Relationship:** This adoption is not temporary but is permanent and eternal, lasting throughout our lives (verse 19).


* **Full Acceptance:** God accepts us unconditionally, not because of anything we have done, but because of his love for us (verse 6).


* **Divine Empowerment:** As God's children, we receive the power of the Holy Spirit to live a new life (verse 19).


**In essence, being adopted as a child of God means experiencing God's unconditional love, receiving forgiveness for our sins, and being welcomed into his family with all the privileges and responsibilities that come with it.**

Comment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the spiritual significance of adoption as a child of God based on Ephesians 1:5. It covers key aspects such as forgiveness, new identity, divine affection, eternal relationship, full acceptance, and divine empowerment, reflecting a deep understanding of the concept within the Christian faith. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to directly reference the specific verse in Ephesians 1:5 to strengthen the connection between the explanation and the biblical text.
