## [Answer](../Understanding_Amen.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**The term "amen" signifies concurrence and agreement with the prayer that has just been offered.**

This understanding aligns with the traditional interpretation of the word "amen" in both Hebrew and Greek, the two languages in which it appears in the Bible.

* **In Hebrew,** "amen" (meaning "so be it" or "thus let it be") signifies an affirmation of the petition made in prayer.
* **In Greek,** "amen" (meaning "indeed" or "so be it") expresses concurrence and agreement with the prayer request.

The use of "amen" at the end of a prayer is a way to:

* **Express personal agreement** with the prayer request.
* **Acknowledge the authority of God** to fulfill the request.
* **Communicate the believer's faith** that God will answer the prayer.
