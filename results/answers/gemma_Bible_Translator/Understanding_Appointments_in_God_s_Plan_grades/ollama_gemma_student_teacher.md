**In a Christian context, 'appointed to eternal life' means:**

God, in His sovereignty and grace, has chosen certain individuals for salvation and eternal life in Christ Jesus. This selection is not based on any merit or works of the recipients but solely on God's loving purpose and grace.

**Biblical References:**

* **Ephesians 1:4:** "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, and destined us to be adoptive sons through Jesus Christ."
* **2 Timothy 1:9:** "I rejoiced greatly when I remembered your faithfulness in Christ Jesus. I am convinced that God did not save us to lose but to save us, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit."
* **John 10:27:** "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish."

**Understanding the Concept:**

* God's election is not based on any human criteria but on His sovereign will and purpose.
* It is not a punishment but a gift of grace.
* It is a secure and eternal destiny.
* The Holy Spirit plays a role in regeneration and renewal, transforming the lives of believers.

**Implications:**

* **Humility and Gratitude:** Recognizing our eternal appointment should lead to humility and gratitude for God's grace.
* **Assurance:** The promise of eternal life offers believers a firm foundation for faith and hope.
* **Obedience:** Our response to God's love should be one of obedience and faithfulness.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The concept of election is often debated and controversial within Christianity.
* Some passages suggest that God's election is limited to a specific people or group.
* The role of free will and God's sovereignty in salvation is a complex theological issue.
