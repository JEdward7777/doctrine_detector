It correctly emphasizes God's sovereignty and grace as the foundation for this appointment, citing relevant biblical passages. The response also touches on the implications of this concept, including humility, gratitude, assurance, and obedience.\n\nHowever, I deducted a few points because the response does not fully engage with the concern about divine selection and grace in the context of salvation. While it mentions God's sovereign will and purpose, it could have explored more deeply the relationship between election and free will, as well as the role of the Holy Spirit in regeneration and renewal.\n\nAdditionally, I would have liked to see a bit more development on the biblical references provided, perhaps highlighting specific verses or phrases that support the concept of appointment to eternal life. Nevertheless, overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of this key Christian doctrine."
