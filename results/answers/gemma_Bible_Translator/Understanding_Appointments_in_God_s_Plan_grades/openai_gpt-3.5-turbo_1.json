  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, supported by relevant biblical references and implications for believers. The understanding of divine election, grace, and the role of the Holy Spirit is well articulated. The response effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the concept of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation from a Christian worldview."
