  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of being 'appointed to eternal life' in a Christian context, supported by relevant biblical references. The understanding of the concept, implications for believers, and additional considerations are well articulated, giving a comprehensive view of the topic. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern by delving into the concept of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation."
