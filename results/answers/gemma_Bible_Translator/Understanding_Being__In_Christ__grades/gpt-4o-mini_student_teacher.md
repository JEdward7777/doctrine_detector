**To be 'in Christ' according to Christian theology:**

**1. Union with Christ:**

* This is the core of Christian faith.
* Believers are united with Christ in his person and work through faith in him.
* This union brings forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and new life in Christ.

**2. Incorporation into Christ's life:**

* When believers are 'in Christ,' they are joined to Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
* They share in Christ's divinity and humanity.
* This means believers participate in Christ's righteousness, power, and glory.

**3. Transformation by Christ:**

* Being 'in Christ' is not just about a legal position, but a transformative experience.
* Christ's love and grace work in believers' lives, changing their character and actions.
* They become new creations in Christ, motivated by his love and empowered by his Spirit.

**4. Participation in Christ's work:**

* Believers are called to participate in Christ's mission on earth.
* This includes sharing the gospel, serving others, and loving God with all their hearts.

**5. Completion in Christ:**

* The ultimate goal of being 'in Christ' is to be completed in Christ at resurrection.
* Believers will receive their glorified bodies and live eternally with God in heaven.

**Biblical References:**

* "In whom you also are being made complete through the uniting of your faith with his blood." (Colossians 1:24)
* "For you are not a slave to fear, but you are a son. And since you are a son, God has made you an heir to his kingdom." (Galatians 4:7)
* "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone away, the new has come." (2 Corinthians 5:17)
