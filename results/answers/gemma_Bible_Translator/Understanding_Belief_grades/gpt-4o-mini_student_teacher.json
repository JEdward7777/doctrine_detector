  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the difference between belief in something and belief in someone, highlighting key differences in nature, object, basis, and consequences. They have effectively tied this explanation to a biblical perspective, citing relevant verses and emphasizing the importance of faith in God and Jesus. However, the student's response is more detailed and analytical compared to the reference answer, which may lead to a slight deduction in grade for deviating from the simplicity of the teacher's provided response."
