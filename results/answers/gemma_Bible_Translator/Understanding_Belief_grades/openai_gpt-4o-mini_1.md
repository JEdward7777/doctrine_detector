* Refers to a deep-seated trust and confidence in the character, abilities, or integrity of a person.
* It involves an emotional attachment and commitment to the person's well-being.
* Belief in someone is based on personal experiences, observations, and a subjective assessment of their character.


**Key Differences:**

* **Nature:** Belief in something is an intellectual process, while belief in someone is an emotional and relational response.
