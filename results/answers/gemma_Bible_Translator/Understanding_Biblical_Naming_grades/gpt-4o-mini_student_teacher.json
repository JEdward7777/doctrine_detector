  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. \n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation on the significance of biblical names and their connection to God's plan, they may have overcomplicated the interpretation in relation to the specific context of \"His name is called John.\" The reference answer from the teacher, which simplifies the interpretation to stating the person's name as John, should have been given more prominence in the response. The student's answer, while informative and insightful, could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the context of the biblical statement provided."
