  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob according to biblical accounts. The answer covers the impact on both Esau and Jacob, as well as the broader implications of the event within a Christian context. The student effectively discussed themes such as spiritual consequences, God's sovereignty, the importance of spiritual inheritance, and lessons on decision-making. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the central idea of Esau losing his inheritance and honor as the firstborn, which was the key concern highlighted in the teacher's reference answer."
