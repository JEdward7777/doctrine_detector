  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical references and the meaning of being blameless before God. They correctly emphasized the importance of obedience, sanctification, and Christ's atonement in achieving blamelessness. However, the student could improve by explicitly addressing the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context, as highlighted in the concern provided. Overall, a commendable response with a solid biblical foundation."
