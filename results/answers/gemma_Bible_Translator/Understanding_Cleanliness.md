## Biblical Concepts of Cleanliness and Moral Purity

The Biblical definitions of "clean" and "unclean" offer profound insights into understanding moral purity. These concepts are not merely external or physical, but delve into the heart and motives of individuals.

**Biblical Perspectives:**

* **Old Testament:**
    * Purity is associated with adherence to God's laws and rituals. (Lev. 15:1-8)

    * Maintaining a clean environment and avoiding unnecessary exposure to impurity reflects an outward manifestation of inward purity.


3. **Compassion and Justice:**
    * The concept of "clean" and "unclean" is not solely about personal hygiene or ritualistic practices. 
    * It encompasses upholding justice and caring for the marginalized. 
    * This aligns with the New Testament emphasis on loving others as oneself.


4. **Transformation and Growth:**
