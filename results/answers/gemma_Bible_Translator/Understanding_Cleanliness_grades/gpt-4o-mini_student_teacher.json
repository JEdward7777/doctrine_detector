  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of how the Biblical concepts of cleanliness and moral purity intersect. They have effectively highlighted the importance of internal purity, external actions, compassion, justice, and transformation in understanding moral purity. The student's discussion aligns well with the concern provided and offers a nuanced perspective from a Christian worldview. However, to improve the grade, they could have emphasized more on the symbolic nature of cleanliness in relation to moral purity, as outlined in the reference answer from the teacher."
