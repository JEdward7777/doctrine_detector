  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the nature of condemnation in light of 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16. The student effectively highlights the differences in perspective between the two verses and offers key aspects and explanations for each. The conclusion ties everything together well. However, to improve the grade, the student could have delved deeper into the doctrinal implications of Christ's sacrifice in abolishing condemnation and could have included more Scriptural references to support their analysis. Overall, a well-written and insightful answer."
