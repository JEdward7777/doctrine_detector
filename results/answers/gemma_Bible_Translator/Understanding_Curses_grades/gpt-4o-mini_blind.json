  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer rooted in relevant scriptural references and has done well to explain the consequences of cursing others from a Biblical perspective. The use of additional insights and practical applications based on biblical principles adds depth to the response. However, the answer could be further enhanced by emphasizing the concept of repentance and seeking forgiveness as a means to address the consequences of cursing others. Overall, a strong answer demonstrating a good understanding of the topic."
