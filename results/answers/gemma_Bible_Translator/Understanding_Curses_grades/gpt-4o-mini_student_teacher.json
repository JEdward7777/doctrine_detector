  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of cursing others from a biblical perspective, supported by relevant scripture references. The answer effectively highlighted the spiritual and relational harm caused by cursing, and emphasized the importance of speaking with grace and love. The additional insights and practical applications further enriched the response. However, the student could have focused more on directly addressing the concern of aligning one's words with God's teachings, as per the reference answer provided by the teacher. A stronger connection to the specific implications of the student's response in light of James 3:10 would have further enhanced the analysis."
