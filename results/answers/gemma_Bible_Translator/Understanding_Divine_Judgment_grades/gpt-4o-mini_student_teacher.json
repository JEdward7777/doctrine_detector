  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed comparison between God's judgment and human judgment, highlighting key differences such as motivation, fairness, mercy, and consequences, they effectively capture the essence of the concern by emphasizing the perfection and righteousness of God's judgment in contrast to the flawed nature of human judgment. Additionally, the inclusion of relevant biblical references and key principles of divine judgment enriches the response.\n\nHowever, the student could strengthen their answer by directly referencing the teacher's answer, which emphasizes God's judgment being based on His perfect righteousness and justice, as well as including a clearer explanation of how God's judgment is distinct from human judgment in terms of response to sin and the call to repentance. By incorporating these elements more explicitly, the student's answer could more directly address the concern provided."
