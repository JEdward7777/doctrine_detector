It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the differences in motivation, fairness, mercy, and consequences between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. The inclusion of biblical references and key principles adds depth and credibility to the response. Great job in presenting a Christian worldview perspective on this topic."
