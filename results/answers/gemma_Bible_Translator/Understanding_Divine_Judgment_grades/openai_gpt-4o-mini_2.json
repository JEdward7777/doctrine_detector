  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a deep understanding of the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. The student effectively contrasts the motivations, fairness, mercy, forgiveness, and consequences of these two forms of judgment from a Christian worldview. The biblical references and key principles provided further support the argument. This response shows critical thinking and provides a thorough analysis with clear explanations, aligning well with Christian beliefs about judgment. Great job!"
