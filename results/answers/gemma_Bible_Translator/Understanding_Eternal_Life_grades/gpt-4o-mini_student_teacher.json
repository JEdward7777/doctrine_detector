  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a clear and well-supported explanation of how to inherit eternal life according to the Bible, emphasizing faith in Jesus Christ as the key factor. However, the grading is lower due to the deviation from the teacher's reference answer, which specifically mentions obeying God's laws as a requirement for inheriting eternal life. In a Christian worldview, obedience to God's laws is typically regarded as essential for receiving eternal life, along with faith in Jesus Christ. It is important for the student to align their answer more closely with the emphasis on obedience to God's laws as per the reference answer."
