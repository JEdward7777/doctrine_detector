  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical teachings regarding inheriting eternal life. They effectively cited relevant scripture passages and provided a clear explanation of the concept of inheritance in the context of faith. The student also acknowledged the need for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ and outlined the steps necessary to receive eternal life. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the idea of obeying God's laws as a prerequisite for inheriting eternal life, as this is not entirely consistent with the traditional Christian understanding of salvation by grace through faith."
