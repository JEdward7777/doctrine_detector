  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer from a Christian perspective, touching on key biblical concepts related to faith and its implications accurately. However, the answer could have been more direct in addressing the concern by explicitly tying the lack of faith to moral conduct, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a strong theological analysis, but slightly missed on aligning perfectly with the specified concern."
