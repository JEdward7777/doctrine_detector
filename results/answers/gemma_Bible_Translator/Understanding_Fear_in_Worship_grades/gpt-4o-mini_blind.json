  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated comparison between Biblical fear and common everyday fear. They effectively differentiate the motivations, objects, attitudes, results, and perspectives of fear in the Bible versus in daily life. The incorporation of relevant Bible verses to support their points enhances the depth of their response. Additionally, highlighting the implications for translation demonstrates an understanding of the importance of accurate theological communication. Overall, a solid explanation with doctrinal correctness."
