- Common fear often involves anxiety, worry, or panic about negative outcomes.


**2. Object:**

- Biblical fear focuses on the holy and righteous character of God, emphasizing his love and justice.
- Common fear can be directed at people, circumstances, or things, often leading to avoidance or superstition.


**3. Attitude:**

- Biblical fear involves trembling before God's authority, while maintaining a submissive and obedient heart.
- Common fear can foster feelings of helplessness, fearfulness, or paranoia.


**4. Result:**

- Biblical fear leads to humility, repentance, and awe, motivating believers to live in obedience and righteousness.
- Common fear can paralyze individuals, leading to avoidance or unhealthy coping mechanisms.


**5. Perspective:**

- Biblical fear acknowledges God's sovereignty and justice but emphasizes his love and redemption.
- Common fear often emphasizes potential threats and anxieties, leading to distress and insecurity.


**Examples in the Bible:**

- **Job 1:21:** "I know that you can do all things, and that no evil shall befall your chosen ones." (Fear of God's justice leading to trust and obedience)
- **Psalm 23:4:** "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life." (Fear of God's love resulting in peace and security)
