The integration of biblical references is commendable, supporting the explanation effectively. The emphasis on forgiveness as a process and the clarification that forgiveness does not enable sinful behavior but seeks restoration and freedom from sin are important additions. However, there could be a deeper exploration of the role of repentance in the process of forgiveness according to Christian beliefs."
