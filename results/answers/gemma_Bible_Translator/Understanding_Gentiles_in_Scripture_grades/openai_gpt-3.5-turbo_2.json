  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles and their impact on early Church relationships, touching on key points such as the initial perception, Jesus' teachings, the early Church response, issues of distinction, Paul's influence, reconciliation and growth, and the legacy of inclusion. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing how the barriers between Jews and Gentiles were challenged and transformed within the early Church context. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or Scripture references to further support the points made."
