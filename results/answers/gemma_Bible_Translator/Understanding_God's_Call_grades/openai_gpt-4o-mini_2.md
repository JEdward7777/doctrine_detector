**When the Bible states that God has called us by name, it signifies:**

**1. Divine Election:**

* God's call is an act of his sovereign grace. He chooses individuals for his purposes, not based on their merit or works.
* This call is evident throughout Scripture, from Abraham being chosen to be the father of the faithful to Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus.

**2. Personal Revelation:**

* God's call is a personal revelation. He speaks directly to each individual, revealing his purpose and love for them.
* This revelation can be through Scripture, prayer, or other spiritual experiences.

**3. Reconciliation and Redemption:**

* God's call is an invitation to reconciliation with him through Jesus Christ.
* His name represents his character and attributes, and when he calls us by name, he is acknowledging our sinfulness but offering redemption through Christ's sacrifice.

**4. Perseverance and Growth:**

* God's call is not just about salvation, but also about growth in faith.
* When God calls us by name, he empowers us to persevere through challenges and grow in our relationship with him.

**5. Acceptance and Belonging:**

* God's call is a reminder that we are accepted and loved by him.
* When he calls us by name, he is acknowledging us as his children and welcoming us into his family.

**Biblical Examples:**

* "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I called you by my name." (Jeremiah 1:5)
* "The Lord called me by name from the fields." (Samuel 1:15-16)
* "You call me, Lord, and I will follow you anywhere." (John 6:35)

**Conclusion:**

God's call by name is a profound and personal experience that reveals God's love, purpose, and acceptance for each individual. It is a call to faith, growth, and a life lived in obedience to God's will.
