**Knowing that Christians are 'called' by God means:**

**1. Election:**
* God's calling is not based on human merit or works, but on his sovereign grace and love.
* God chooses individuals for his purposes, knowing their hearts and their potential for good. (Romans 9:11-13)

**2. Reconciliation:**
* God's calling is to reconcile us to himself through Jesus Christ.
* When we accept his call, we are forgiven of our sins and restored to a right relationship with him. (2 Timothy 1:9)

**3. Obedience:**
* God's calling is not just about receiving forgiveness, but about living a life that pleases him.
* As followers of Christ, we are called to love God with all our hearts and to love others as ourselves. (Matthew 22:37-39)

**4. Purpose:**
* God's calling gives us a sense of purpose and direction in life.
* When we understand that we are called by God, we can live with greater meaning and motivation. (1 Peter 2:9)

**5. Community:**
* God's calling is not a solitary journey.
* Christians are called to be part of a community of believers, united in faith and love. (1 Corinthians 12:13)

**Biblical References:**

* Romans 8:29 - "For whom he did foreknow, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."
* Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast."
* 1 Peter 1:1 - "To those who are elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit."

**In summary, knowing that Christians are 'called' by God means accepting God's unconditional love, committing to obedience, discovering a purpose in life, and becoming part of a community of believers.**
