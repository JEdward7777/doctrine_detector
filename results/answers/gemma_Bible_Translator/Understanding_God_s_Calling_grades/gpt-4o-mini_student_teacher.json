They incorporated relevant biblical references to support their points and connected the concept of calling to themes such as election, reconciliation, obedience, purpose, and community. However, the answer could have been improved by aligning the main thesis more closely with the reference answer provided by emphasizing the aspect of being chosen and appointed by God for His special purpose and work."
