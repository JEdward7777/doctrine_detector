**Knowing that Christians are 'called' by God means:**

**1. Election:**
* God's calling is not based on human merit or works, but on his sovereign grace and love.
* God chooses individuals for his purposes, knowing their hearts and their potential for good. (Romans 9:11-13)

**2. Reconciliation:**
* God's calling is to reconcile us to himself through Jesus Christ.
* When we accept his call, we are forgiven of our sins and restored to a right relationship with him. (2 Timothy 1:9)

**3. Obedience:**
* God's calling is not just about receiving forgiveness, but about living a life that pleases him.
* As followers of Christ, we are called to love God with all our hearts and to love others as ourselves. (Matthew 22:37-39)

**4. Purpose:**
* God's calling gives us a sense of purpose and direction in life.
* When we understand that we are called by God, we can live with greater meaning and motivation. (1 Peter 2:9)

**5. Community:**
* God's calling is not a solitary journey.
* Christians are called to be part of a community of believers, united in faith and love. (1 Corinthians 12:13)

**Biblical References:**

* Romans 8:29 - "For whom he did foreknow, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."
* Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast."
* 1 Peter 1:1 - "To those who are elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit."

**In summary, knowing that Christians are 'called' by God means accepting God's unconditional love, committing to obedience, discovering a purpose in life, and becoming part of a community of believers.**

Comment: The response provides a good overview of the concept of being "called" by God, highlighting its connection to election, reconciliation, obedience, purpose, and community. It also includes relevant biblical references that support the idea. However, it does not fully capture the nuances of personal purpose in the context of faith. While it mentions the importance of discovering a sense of purpose in life as part of being "called" by God, it could be further developed to provide more practical advice and examples for readers to apply their understanding of personal purpose in their daily lives.
