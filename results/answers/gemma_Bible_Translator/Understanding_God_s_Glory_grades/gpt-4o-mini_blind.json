  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate comparison between the concept of God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory. The Biblical perspective is well articulated, emphasizing key doctrinal aspects such as God's intrinsic worth, love, justice, and eternal nature. The student effectively highlights the differences in the source, focus, permanence, subjectivity, and purpose of God's glory versus worldly glory. This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological distinctions between the two perspectives. Great job!"
