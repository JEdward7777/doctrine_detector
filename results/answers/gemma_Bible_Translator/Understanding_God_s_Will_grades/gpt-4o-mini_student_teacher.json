  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out explanation of seeking God's will in everyday decisions, the answer could have been more concise and focused on aligning choices with what is pleasing to God as revealed in Scripture, which is the reference answer. However, the inclusion of practical examples and key principles adds depth to the response and demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept. The student effectively addressed the concern of people struggling with decision-making and uncertainty about God's direction by providing practical steps and considerations for seeking God's will in various aspects of life."
