  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and insightful guide on how to seek God's will in everyday decisions, covering important aspects such as examining Scripture, prayer, reflection, discernment, consulting with others, and emphasizing obedience and trust. The key principles highlighted, along with practical examples, enhance the understanding of the process. The only minor area for improvement would be to provide more specific examples related to struggling with decision-making or feeling uncertain about God's direction to address the concern raised."
