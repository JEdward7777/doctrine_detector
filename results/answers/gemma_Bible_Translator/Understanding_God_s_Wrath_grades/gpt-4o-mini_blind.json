  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the nature of God's wrath compared to human anger, drawing from biblical examples and key distinctions. The student effectively highlights the motivations, scope, intensity, purpose, and timing/control of God's wrath. The doctrinal correctness is strong, but there could be more emphasis on the eternal justice aspect of God's wrath and how it upholds His righteousness. Additionally, connecting God's wrath to His redemptive plan could further strengthen the theological depth of the answer."
