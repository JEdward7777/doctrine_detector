  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the nature of God's wrath as compared to human anger. They have effectively conveyed the biblical perspective on this topic and highlighted key distinctions between the two. The biblical examples cited further support their points. The only slight room for improvement would be to include more direct references to specific Bible verses that explicitly address the nature of God's wrath to further reinforce their argument."
