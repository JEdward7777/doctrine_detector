  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe response provides a clear and accurate description of God's wrath, highlighting its righteous and just nature, as well as its distinction from human anger. The writer effectively illustrates the motivations behind God's wrath (love and justice) and its scope (universal but targeted at sin). They also accurately describe the purpose of God's wrath (transformative, leading to repentance and restoration) and its intensity (greater than human anger).\n\nThe response also provides several biblical examples that demonstrate God's wrath, which helps to support the writer's claims. The distinction between God's wrath and human anger is well-articulated, emphasizing that God's wrath is not motivated by personal feelings or human experiences.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from more explicit connection to the concern about God's wrath being a measured response to sin. While the writer does mention that God's wrath is not a \"fit of rage,\" they could have further emphasized this point and explicitly tied it back to the concern. Nevertheless, the response overall demonstrates a strong understanding of God's wrath and its distinctiveness from human anger.\n\nComment: This response is strong in its description of God's wrath and its distinction from human anger.
