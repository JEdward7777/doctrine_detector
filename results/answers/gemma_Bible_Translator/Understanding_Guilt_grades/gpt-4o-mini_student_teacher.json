  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of guilt according to the Bible, supported by relevant biblical references. They have effectively highlighted the key elements of guilt, the consequences of guilt, and the concept of forgiveness in Christian theology. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the given reference answer from the teacher, demonstrating a clear connection to the specified concern and emphasizing the central theme of disobeying God in defining guilt according to the Bible."
