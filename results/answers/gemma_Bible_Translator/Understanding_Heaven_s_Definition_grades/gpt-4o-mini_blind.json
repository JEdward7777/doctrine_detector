  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of the biblical definition of heaven, emphasizing its spiritual nature and eternal significance. They correctly highlighted that heaven is not solely a physical location but a state of being in fellowship with God. The distinction between the literal sky and the spiritual realm of heaven is well articulated. One improvement could be to provide more direct scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
