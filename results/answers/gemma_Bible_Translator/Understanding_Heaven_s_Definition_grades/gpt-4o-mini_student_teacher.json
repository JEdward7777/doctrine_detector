  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the biblical definition of heaven, highlighting its spiritual significance and eternal nature. They appropriately address the concern by emphasizing the distinction between heaven as a spiritual realm where believers dwell with God and the sky as the physical expanse above the earth. The student's explanation is clear, supported by relevant biblical references, and aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the grade could be higher if the student had incorporated more direct comparison to the reference answer provided by the teacher to further enhance their response."
