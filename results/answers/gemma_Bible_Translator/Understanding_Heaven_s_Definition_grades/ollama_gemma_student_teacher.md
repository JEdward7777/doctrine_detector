## Question [Understanding Heaven's Definition](../../../questions/Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md)
What is the biblical definition of 'heaven' and how does it differ from 'sky'?

## Correct Answer
In the Bible, 'heaven' usually refers to where God lives, while 'sky' refers to the blue expanse above the earth. The term 'heavens' encompasses everything above the earth, including celestial bodies like the sun and stars.

## Stated Concern
It's essential to understand the different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture, as they can impact our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him.

## Biblical Definition of Heaven:

**The primary biblical definition of heaven is not a physical location, but a state of being.** It refers to:

* **Eternal dwelling place:** Heaven is described as the final and eternal home for believers (Matthew 25:34, Revelation 21:4).
* **Union with God:** The ultimate joy of heaven is being in fellowship with God (John 17:3).
* **Perfection and bliss:** Heaven is a state of complete peace, joy, and righteousness (1 Corinthians 2:9, Revelation 21:3).

**Biblical references often use "heaven" in two ways:**

1. **The literal sky:** This refers to the physical realm above the earth (Genesis 1:14, Psalm 104:3).
2. **The spiritual realm:** This refers to the realm of the spirits, including angels and the presence of God (2 Corinthians 12:2, Ephesians 6:12).


**Therefore, heaven is not simply the physical sky. It is a spiritual realm that transcends the physical world and represents the ultimate destination for believers.**
