It appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the distinctions between \"heaven\" and \"sky\" in Scripture for a deeper understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him. This response effectively integrates a Christian worldview and biblical references to support the explanation."
