The inclusion of biblical references and the distinction between the literal sky and spiritual realm adds depth to the explanation. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding the distinctions between terms like 'heaven' and 'sky' in Scripture for a deeper comprehension of God's nature and our relationship with Him."
