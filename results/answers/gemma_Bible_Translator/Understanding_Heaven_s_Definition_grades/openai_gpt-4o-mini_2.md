## Biblical Definition of Heaven:

**The primary biblical definition of heaven is not a physical location, but a state of being.** It refers to:

* **Eternal dwelling place:** Heaven is described as the final and eternal home for believers (Matthew 25:34, Revelation 21:4).
* **Union with God:** The ultimate joy of heaven is being in fellowship with God (John 17:3).
* **Perfection and bliss:** Heaven is a state of complete peace, joy, and righteousness (1 Corinthians 2:9, Revelation 21:3).

**Biblical references often use "heaven" in two ways:**

1. **The literal sky:** This refers to the physical realm above the earth (Genesis 1:14, Psalm 104:3).
2. **The spiritual realm:** This refers to the realm of the spirits, including angels and the presence of God (2 Corinthians 12:2, Ephesians 6:12).


**Therefore, heaven is not simply the physical sky. It is a spiritual realm that transcends the physical world and represents the ultimate destination for believers.**
