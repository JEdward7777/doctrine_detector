- **Romans 4:13:** "For the promise, that he should inherit the blessing of Abraham, is confirmed to us."
- **Galatians 3:14:** "But if you are a child of the promise, you are heirs according to the promise."

**Understanding the inheritance:**

- The inheritance includes God's blessing, righteousness, and eternal life.
- The heir is considered worthy of the inheritance due to their relationship to the promisor (Abraham or Christ).
- The inheritance is not based on merit or works but on God's grace and redemption.

**Applying the concept of heirship:**

- **Assurance of God's promises:** Believers can confidently claim God's promises because they are heirs of the blessing of Abraham.
- **Perseverance and faithfulness:** The heirship underscores the importance of faithfulness and perseverance in following God's commands.
