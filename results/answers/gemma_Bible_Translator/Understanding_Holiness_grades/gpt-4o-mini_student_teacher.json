The student effectively addresses key aspects of God's holiness and how it should influence our humility, fear, transformation, gratitude, and accountability. The only minor improvement would be to explicitly emphasize the aspect of needing God's allowance to approach Him due to our sinful nature, as highlighted in the reference answer."
