## Biblical Distinction between Iniquity, Sin, and Transgression:

**1. Iniquity:**

* Primarily refers to a state of moral imperfection or departure from righteousness.
* Often used in the context of divine judgment upon humanity due to their sinful actions.
* Example: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).

**2. Sin:**

* Represents conscious violation of God's law or principles.
* Involves deliberate disobedience or wrongdoing.
* Often carries the penalty of divine punishment.
* Example: "Whoever transgresses the law is guilty of sin" (James 2:10).

**3. Transgression:**

* Represents a deliberate violation of God's law or commands.
* Specifically refers to exceeding or going beyond what is permitted.
* Often involves conscious defiance or disregard for God's authority.
* Example: "Do not transgressed the Son of God" (Matthew 26:52).

**Relationship to Each Other:**

* **Sin is a type of transgression:** Every sin is a deliberate violation of God's law, but not all transgressions are necessarily sins.
* **Iniquity encompasses sin:** Iniquity includes both deliberate and unintentional violations of God's law, while sin specifically refers to conscious violations.

**Key Distinctions:**

* **Emphasis:** Iniquity focuses on the inherent fallenness of humanity, while sin emphasizes conscious disobedience.
* **Punishment:** Both sin and transgression incur divine punishment, while iniquity primarily results in God's judgment upon humanity.

**Conclusion:**

While these terms are often used interchangeably, understanding their distinct meanings is important for accurate biblical interpretation and understanding God's condemnation of human behavior.
