  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComments: This response provides a solid overview of the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression. The definitions and examples given are generally accurate and align with Christian teachings. The response effectively highlights the relationship between these concepts and offers a clear explanation of their key distinctions. However, there could be further depth added to each point, especially in discussing the theological implications of these terms within the Christian worldview. Additionally, tying these concepts back to the foundational doctrine of sin and redemption through Christ could enhance the completeness of the response."
