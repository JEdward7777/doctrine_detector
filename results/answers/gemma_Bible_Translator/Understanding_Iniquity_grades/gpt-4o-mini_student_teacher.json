  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression, which aligns with the reference answer to a certain extent. However, the student's answer tends to be overly complex and occasionally deviates from the specific concern of how understanding these distinctions can help Christians in recognizing the gravity of their actions and seeking repentance. Simplifying the language and focusing more on the practical implications for believers would improve the grade of this response."
