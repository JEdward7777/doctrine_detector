  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns with biblical teachings on innocence in the context of wrongful accusation. They have effectively referenced relevant Bible verses and connected the concept of innocence to broader theological implications within Christianity. The response could be improved by further elaborating on the redemptive aspect of innocence through Christ's sacrifice and the importance of forgiveness in cases of wrongful accusation. Overall, a strong effort demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic."
