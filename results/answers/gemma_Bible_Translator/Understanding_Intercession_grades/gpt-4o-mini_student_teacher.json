They demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and effectively explained the Spirit's involvement in prayer. However, the reference answer is more concise and direct, focusing solely on the Holy Spirit interceding for believers, which could be seen as the main teaching on the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession according to the Bible."
