The writer provides specific biblical support and expands on the concept with helpful explanations (e.g., the Spirit's ability to translate human words into the language of heaven, His knowledge of believers' needs better than they do). The only area for improvement is a lack of explicit connection between the Holy Spirit's involvement in intercession and the believer's role. While the response acknowledges the importance of the believer's prayer in Ephesians 6:18, it does not explicitly state how this relates to the Holy Spirit's intercession."
