However, it could be enhanced by placing a stronger emphasis on the redemptive aspect of lamentation, highlighting how it ultimately leads to a deeper intimacy with God and a trust in His sovereign plan. Additionally, tying the concept of lamentation more explicitly to the Christian worldview and theology would strengthen the doctrinal correctness of the response."
