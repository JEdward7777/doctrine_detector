  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a thorough and well-structured explanation of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. The student effectively highlights key aspects such as deity, supremacy, authority, compassion, and care. The biblical references and their relevance to the discussion are commendable. However, it would have been beneficial to include more direct Scriptural citations that specifically emphasize Jesus' lordship and divine nature. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response. Well done."
