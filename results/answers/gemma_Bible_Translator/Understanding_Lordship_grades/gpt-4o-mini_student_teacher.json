  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-articulated explanation of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. They accurately covered key aspects such as deity, supremacy, authority, compassion, and care. The Biblical references provided support the student's points effectively. However, the student could strengthen their answer by emphasizing the aspect of ownership or authority more explicitly, as mentioned in the reference answer from the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the significance of the term \"Lord\" in the Christian worldview."
