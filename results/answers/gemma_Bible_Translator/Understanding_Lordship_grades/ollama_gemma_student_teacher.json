Additionally, the inclusion of relevant biblical references reinforces the credibility of the answer. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the aspect of Jesus being referred to as \"Lord.\" The connection between the title \"Lord\" and Jesus' divinity could be explicitly stated."
