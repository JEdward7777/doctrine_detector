  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by acknowledging that the term \"Lord\" is used as a title for God and that it communicates Jesus' divinity when used in phrases like 'Lord Jesus' and 'Lord Jesus Christ.' However, the response does not fully explore the significance of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus, nor does it delve into the various connotations and implications of this title.\n\nThe answer also lacks specific biblical references and examples that would support its claims. While it mentions the use of \"Lord\" as a title for God, it does not provide a nuanced understanding of its significance in different contexts, such as Psalm 23:1 or Romans 10:9.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could benefit from more detailed explanations and biblical examples that demonstrate the multifaceted nature of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus."
