  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's character, covering various aspects such as divine glory, transcendence, royal authority, grace, and worship. It effectively elaborates on God's attributes and His sovereignty over creation, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The only slight room for improvement could be further connecting the specific aspects of majesty described with the overarching understanding of God's sovereignty, but overall, the response is comprehensive and insightful."
