The term "born again" is primarily used in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospel of John (John 3:3-7). It refers to a transformative spiritual experience that results in a new life in Christ.

**Biblical Understanding:**

* **New Birth:** The process of being "born again" is often compared to being born physically. It signifies a complete change of heart and life.
* **Spirit-Led Transformation:** The Holy Spirit plays a vital role in this transformation, regenerating the believer's spirit.

**The Process of Being 'Born Again':**

The Bible teaches that being "born again" is a work of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ. It involves:

* **Faith in Christ:** Trusting in Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection as the basis for salvation.
* **Repentance:** Turning away from sin and turning towards God.
* **Baptism:** Symbolic representation of the new life in Christ (not essential for salvation, but recommended).

**Conclusion:**

Being "born again" is a foundational belief in Christianity, representing a transformative spiritual experience that leads to eternal life and a new life in Christ. It is a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ, and is essential for entering the kingdom of God.
