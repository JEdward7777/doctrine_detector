**Biblical Understanding:**

* **New Birth:** The process of being "born again" is often compared to being born physically. It signifies a complete change of heart and life.
* **Spirit-Led Transformation:** The Holy Spirit plays a vital role in this transformation, regenerating the believer's spirit.

The Bible teaches that being "born again" is a work of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ. It involves:

* **Faith in Christ:** Trusting in Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection as the basis for salvation.
* **Repentance:** Turning away from sin and turning towards God.
