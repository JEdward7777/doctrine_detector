  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the concept of 'perish' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament, drawing from relevant biblical passages and articulating the implications of spiritual separation from God. The references provided align well with the concern of exploring spiritual separation from God. The inclusion of key concepts related to spiritual death in the New Testament further enhances the depth of the answer. However, the student's response could have been strengthened by more direct and explicit reference to trusting in Jesus for salvation, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a thorough and well-supported explanation."
