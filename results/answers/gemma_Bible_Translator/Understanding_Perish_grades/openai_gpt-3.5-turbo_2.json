  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides detailed and supported explanations of how 'perishing' spiritually is understood in the New Testament, highlighting separation from God, loss of spiritual life, spiritual death, complete loss of spiritual potential, and missing out on eternal life. The key concepts related to spiritual death are also effectively referenced. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the consequences of being spiritually separated from God and the significance of trusting in Jesus for salvation."
