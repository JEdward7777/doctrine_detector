  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed answer addressing various aspects of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of propitiation, which demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. However, the answer may have gone into more detail than necessary and could have been more concise in connecting Jesus' sacrifice specifically to how it satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath, as per the reference answer provided by the teacher."
