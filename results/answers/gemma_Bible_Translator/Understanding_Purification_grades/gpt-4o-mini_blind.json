They have effectively highlighted the importance of purification in restoring fellowship with God, maintaining purity in the community, prefiguring Christ's redemption, showing God's holiness, and teaching spiritual truths. The references to relevant scriptural passages and examples from the Old Testament further bolster their explanation. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
