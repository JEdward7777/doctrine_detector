It adequately addresses the concern by emphasizing how the process of ritual purification reflects God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin. The examples provided further strengthen the explanation. Overall, this response demonstrates a deep understanding and application of a Christian worldview to the concept of purification in the Old Testament. Great job!"
