* **Upright and truthful:** He stands in moral opposition to all that is false or dishonest. 
* **Just:** He punishes sin and rewards righteousness. 
* **Compassionate:** His righteousness is not based on rigid legalism but on a deep love for justice and mercy.

* **Hope:** God's righteousness gives hope to those who are struggling with sin. 
* **Motivation:** God's righteousness motivates Christians to live lives that reflect his character.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student has provided a thorough and thoughtful explanation of God's righteousness, highlighting various aspects of His character and how it relates to Christian theology. The response effectively connects God's righteousness to important concepts such as salvation, hope, and motivation. However, the student's answer could benefit from emphasizing more explicitly the condemning nature of God's righteousness towards sin, as mentioned in the reference answer. Strengthening this aspect would provide a more complete understanding of the nature of God's righteousness in relation to His justice and love.
