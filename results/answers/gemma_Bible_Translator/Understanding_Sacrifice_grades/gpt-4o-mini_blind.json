It accurately connects Jesus' sacrificial role to biblical prophecies, parallels with Old Testament sacrifices, symbolism of purity and sacrifice, representation of the New Covenant, and demonstration of God's love. The answer is well-supported biblically and effectively conveys the significance of Jesus as the ultimate atoning sacrifice. Great job!"
