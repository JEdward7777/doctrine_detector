  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that addresses the significance of Jesus being referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. They accurately touch upon various theological aspects such as the fulfillment of prophecy, parallelism to sacrifices, symbolism of purity and sacrifice, representation of the New Covenant, and the demonstration of God's love through Jesus' sacrifice. However, the student's answer expands upon the reference answer by providing more in-depth explanations and covering a wider range of theological implications. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic and a strong ability to connect biblical concepts with the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role."
