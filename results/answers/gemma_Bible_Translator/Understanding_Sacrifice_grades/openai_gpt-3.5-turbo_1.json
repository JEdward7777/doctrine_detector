The response effectively incorporates biblical references, theological reasoning, and symbolic significance to convey the depth of Jesus' sacrificial role. The additional insights provided enhance the understanding of how Jesus as the 'Lamb of God' fulfills prophecies, symbolizes purity and sacrifice, establishes a New Covenant, and demonstrates God's love through his ultimate sacrifice. The response could have further emphasized the specific theological significance of Jesus being the perfect and unblemished sacrifice in connection to the Old Testament sacrificial system."
