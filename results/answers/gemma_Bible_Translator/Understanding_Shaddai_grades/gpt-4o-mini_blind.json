  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the meaning of the Hebrew term 'Shaddai' and its usage in the Old Testament. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the term's significance in expressing God's power, sovereignty, and protection. However, to improve the grade, the student could further strengthen the theological implications of God being referred to as 'Shaddai,' linking it more explicitly to His attributes such as omnipotence, omnipresence, and provision. Additionally, connecting the term 'Shaddai' to Christological implications within Christian theology would deepen the analysis. Overall, a well-written response that shows comprehension of the topic."
