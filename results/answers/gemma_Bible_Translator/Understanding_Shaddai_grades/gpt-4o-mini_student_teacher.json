  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed explanation of the meaning and usage of the Hebrew term 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament, focusing on themes such as divine power, sovereignty, and protection. However, the student's answer does not align perfectly with the teacher's reference answer, which mentions that 'Shaddai' is often translated as 'the Almighty' and may have origins related to 'mountain' or 'mountain range.' While the student's answer is informative and demonstrates an understanding of God's attributes as revealed in Scripture, a closer alignment with the specific translation and origin of 'Shaddai' as per the teacher's reference answer could have improved their response."
