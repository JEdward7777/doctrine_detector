  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed response outlining various strategies Jesus used to resist Satan's temptations, which align well with the concern of combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. The inclusion of scriptural references and practical examples enhances the strength of the answer. However, the student could have focused more on the central idea of Jesus using scripture and unwavering faith in God as the primary strategies to resist temptations, as indicated in the reference answer. Despite this, the comprehensive exploration of different strategies and their applications warrants a high grade."
