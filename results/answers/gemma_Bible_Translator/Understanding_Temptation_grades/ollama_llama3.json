  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern about understanding how to combat temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ by highlighting Jesus' strategies for resisting Satan's temptations. The response provides specific examples from Scripture and explains each strategy, including scripture warfare, humility and dependence on God, counter-temptation strategies, prayer and fasting, avoiding temptation sources, and focusing on the greater goal.\n\nThe only area where this response could be improved is in its ability to directly relate Jesus' strategies to daily life as a follower of Christ. While the response provides valuable insights into Jesus' responses to temptation, it does not explicitly connect these strategies to specific challenges or temptations that Christians may face in their daily lives. To improve this response, I would suggest adding examples or applications of each strategy to specific scenarios or temptations that followers of Christ might encounter.\n\nOverall, however, this response is well-written, clear, and provides valuable insights into Jesus' strategies for resisting temptation."
