  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a **95**.\n\nThe student provided a thorough explanation of what the term 'transgress' implies in a Biblical context, supported by relevant biblical references, theological interpretations, examples, implications, and consequences. They demonstrated a clear understanding of the nature of sin and the importance of one's relationship with God's commandments. The inclusion of specific biblical examples added depth to their response, and the emphasis on obedience to God's law aligns well with a Christian worldview. Overall, a well-articulated and comprehensive answer."
