  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the concepts of trespass and sin in a Christian worldview. The student effectively connects the two concepts, supported by relevant Bible verses. The emphasis on the need for forgiveness through Jesus Christ is commendable. One suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on the concept of divine justice and how Christ's sacrifice addresses the trespass of sin. Overall, a well-structured and doctrinally sound response."
