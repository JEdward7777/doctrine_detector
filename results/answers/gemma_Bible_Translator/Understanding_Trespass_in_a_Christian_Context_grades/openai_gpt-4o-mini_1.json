  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of trespass and sin within a Christian worldview, clearly connecting them and emphasizing the gravity of sin as an intrusion into the holiness of God. The relevant Bible verses effectively support the discussion. The additional considerations also add depth to the explanation. The only area for improvement would be to include more explicit examples of how interpersonal violations can be considered as trespasses against God to further clarify the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
