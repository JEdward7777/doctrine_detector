Grade: 85

Comment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of characteristics of an unholy life and includes practical ways to identify unholiness in actions and society. The response is well-structured, drawing from biblical principles and offering specific examples. However, the answer could have been strengthened by focusing more explicitly on the Christian worldview perspective and emphasizing the ultimate consequence of living an unholy life in relation to God's holiness. Incorporating more scriptural references could have further enhanced the Christian perspective. Overall, a solid effort, but room for deeper theological reflection.
