  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively expands on the concept of 'woe' in biblical warnings and judgments, providing well-supported biblical examples, significance, interpretation, theological implications, and a clear conclusion. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment from a Christian worldview. The response effectively integrates scriptural references and theological reflection to address the concern raised."
