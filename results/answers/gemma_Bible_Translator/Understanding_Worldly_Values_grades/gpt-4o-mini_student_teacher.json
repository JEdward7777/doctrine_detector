  "grade": 72.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 72\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-explained and detailed response regarding the implications of being 'worldly' according to Christian teachings and the contrast between worldly values and godly principles. The student effectively references biblical verses to support their explanation and highlights the importance of living a life that is separate from worldly values. However, the student's answer does not align entirely with the specified Christian worldview as the reference answer emphasizes the evil values and behaviors associated with being 'worldly', while the student's response focuses more on the contrast between worldly and godly values. While the student's answer is informative and well-structured, there is a slight deviation from the specific concern provided in the grading criteria which affects the grade."
