  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good foundation for understanding the concept of being \"worldly\" from a Christian perspective. It correctly identifies that worldly refers to values and behaviors that are contrary to biblical teachings, such as selfishness, corruption, and ungodliness. The response also acknowledges the importance of separating oneself from these values in order to live according to godly principles.\n\nHowever, the grade is not higher because the response could be more explicit in highlighting the contrast between worldly values and godly principles. While the Bible references are provided, they are mainly used to illustrate the concept rather than explicitly demonstrate the contrast. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more detailed explanation of what it means to live an \"unworldly\" life and how this looks practically.\n\nOverall, while the response is on the right track, it could be further developed to provide a clearer understanding of the contrast between worldly values and godly principles."
