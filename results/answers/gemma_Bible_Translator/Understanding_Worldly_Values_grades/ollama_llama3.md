## [Answer](../Understanding_Worldly_Values.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**According to Christian teachings, the term 'worldly' implies a separation of the behaviors and values of people from those that are aligned with the values of the world system.**

**Biblical Perspective:**

* 1 John 2:15-17 emphasizes the distinction between those who are of the world and those who are not of the world.
* Paul instructs believers to be transformed by the renewing of their minds (Romans 12:2) and to count everything as loss for the sake of Christ (Philippians 3:7).
* Jesus himself warned his followers to be wary of the values and practices of the world (Matthew 7:16).

**Christian Understanding:**

* **Worldly values:** These are values, beliefs, and practices that are prevalent in the wider culture and society, but are not in accordance with biblical teachings. They often prioritize things like wealth, pleasure, and self-indulgence.
* **Christian values:** These are values that are based on the teachings of the Bible, such as love, humility, forgiveness, and obedience to God.

**Implications of Being 'Unworldly':**

* **Separation from the world:** Christians are called to live a life that is separate from the world in terms of their values and practices.
* **Witnessing for Christ:** The way we live our lives can be a witness to the gospel.
* **Purity of heart:** Living a life that is unworldly helps to keep our hearts pure from the corruption of the world.

**Therefore, for a Christian, being 'worldly' implies aligning oneself with the values and behaviors of the world system, while 'unworldly' implies a deliberate separation from those values and behaviors in order to live in accordance with biblical teachings.**

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a good foundation for understanding the concept of being "worldly" from a Christian perspective. It correctly identifies that worldly refers to values and behaviors that are contrary to biblical teachings, such as selfishness, corruption, and ungodliness. The response also acknowledges the importance of separating oneself from these values in order to live according to godly principles.

However, the grade is not higher because the response could be more explicit in highlighting the contrast between worldly values and godly principles. While the Bible references are provided, they are mainly used to illustrate the concept rather than explicitly demonstrate the contrast. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more detailed explanation of what it means to live an "unworldly" life and how this looks practically.

Overall, while the response is on the right track, it could be further developed to provide a clearer understanding of the contrast between worldly values and godly principles.
