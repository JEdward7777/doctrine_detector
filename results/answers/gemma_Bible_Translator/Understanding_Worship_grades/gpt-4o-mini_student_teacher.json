They supported their explanation with relevant Biblical references and outlined the characteristics of worship in a Christian context effectively. The emphasis on the transformation of the heart in true worship aligns well with the concern of understanding the significance of worship in a Christian's life. This answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of worship from a Christian worldview."
