The explanation of Sheol and Hades is doctrinally sound and distinguishes between their temporary and permanent nature well. However, the mention of the unrighteous being sentenced to \"eternal punishment in Hades\" may need further clarification or scriptural support as some Christian traditions believe in the concept of Gehenna as the final place of punishment for the unrighteous. Overall, a solid explanation with room for minor improvements and additional Biblical references."
