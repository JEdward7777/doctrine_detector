  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the differences between Sheol and Hades, highlighting their temporary and permanent natures and their associations with the righteous and unrighteous. They demonstrate a good understanding of the topic and effectively address the concern of the distinction in the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death. However, the answer could have been improved by further emphasizing the evolving understanding of Sheol and Hades over time, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
