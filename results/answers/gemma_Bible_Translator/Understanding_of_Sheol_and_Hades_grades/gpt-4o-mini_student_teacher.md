## Question [Understanding of Sheol and Hades](../../../questions/Understanding_of_Sheol_and_Hades.md)
How do the concepts of Sheol and Hades differ in the context of the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous?

## Correct Answer
In biblical context, Sheol and Hades refer to a place of the dead but were understood differently over time. Initially, both represented a neutral place where all the dead awaited judgment. However, in the New Testament, Hades becomes associated primarily with the unrighteous, contrasting with 'Abraham's side' or 'paradise' for the righteous.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death.

## [Answer](../Understanding_of_Sheol_and_Hades.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
## Differences between Sheol and Hades in the Bible:

**Sheol:**

* Represents a **temporary** state of separation from life.
* Primarily used in the **Old Testament** to describe the **common grave** of anyone, regardless of their righteousness.
* Often associated with **forgetfulness** and **silence**.
* Represents a temporary holding place until the resurrection at the end of days.

**Hades:**

* Represents a **permanent** realm of **darkness and separation from God**.
* Primarily used in the **New Testament** to describe the **eternal destination** of the unrighteous.
* Represents a state of **punishment and separation** from God's presence.


**Differences in the afterlife:**

**For the righteous:**

* The Bible teaches that the righteous will be **resurrected** to life at the return of Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 15:23).
* Their souls are believed to be in **heaven** or with God until the resurrection.

**For the unrighteous:**

* The unrighteous are judged by God and sentenced to **eternal punishment in Hades**.
* Their souls experience **separation from God, suffering, and punishment**.

**Both Sheol and Hades are temporary or permanent states of separation from God, but they differ in their nature and consequences.** Sheol is a temporary holding place for all people, while Hades is the eternal destination for those who have rejected God's offer of salvation.
