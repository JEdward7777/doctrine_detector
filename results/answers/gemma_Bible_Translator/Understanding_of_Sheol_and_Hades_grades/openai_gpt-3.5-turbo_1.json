It effectively addresses the concern by discussing how the fates of the righteous and unrighteous differ in the afterlife. The only minor point of improvement would be to clearly tie in the concept of the righteous being in heaven or with God until the resurrection, as mentioned in the initial response to fully integrate the Christian worldview perspective."
