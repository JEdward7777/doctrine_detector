It also effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the fate of the righteous (resurrection to life) and the unrighteous (eternal punishment in Hades). The response accurately reflects a Christian worldview regarding the afterlife and the final destinies of the righteous and unrighteous. Great job!"
