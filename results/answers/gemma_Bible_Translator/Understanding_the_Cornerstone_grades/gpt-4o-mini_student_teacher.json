  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the role of Jesus Christ as the cornerstone in the Assembly of believers. They correctly highlight various aspects such as Jesus being the foundation, identity, guiding presence, source of hope, and cornerstone of faith. However, the answer goes beyond the reference answer by including additional details which may slightly dilute the focus on the foundational support aspect mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic but could benefit from more emphasis on the foundational support aspect for a closer alignment with the reference answer."
