**2. Identity of the Assembly:**

* As the cornerstone, Jesus Christ gives the Assembly its identity and purpose (Colossians 2:19). 
* He is the head of the Church, and the Assembly is his body (Colossians 1:18).
* Through him, the Assembly finds its unity and purpose in God's kingdom.

**3. Guiding Presence:**

* Jesus Christ is the living cornerstone, offering guidance and support to the Assembly (Hebrews 13:20-21). 
* His presence encourages and strengthens the believers (John 14:23).
* He stands with the Assembly in all its endeavors and challenges.

**4. Source of Hope:**
