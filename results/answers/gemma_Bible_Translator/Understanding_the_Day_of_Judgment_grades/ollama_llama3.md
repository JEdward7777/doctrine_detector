I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus and His role as judge, which aligns with the question's intention. The response also provides some biblical references to support its claims, although they could be more directly related to the topic at hand. The main issue is that the response does not fully develop or elaborate on each point, leaving room for further expansion.

The strengths of this response include:

* It accurately states Jesus' sinless nature and His relationship with God.
* It correctly emphasizes the significance of faith in Jesus.
* It provides some relevant biblical references to support its claims.

To improve this response, consider adding more detail and examples to each point, as well as providing more directly related biblical references. This would help to further develop the ideas and provide a stronger connection between the response's main points and the concern being addressed.
