  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive overview of the term \"house of God\" in the biblical context. The student effectively explains the various meanings of the term, provides scriptural references, and discusses the theological significance and examples. The focus on the literal structures, spiritual community, and God's presence associated with the \"house of God\" is well articulated. The only area for improvement could be to add a stronger emphasis on the sacrificial aspect of the Old Testament temple to align more closely with Christian doctrine regarding the symbolic nature of sacrifices pointing to Christ."
