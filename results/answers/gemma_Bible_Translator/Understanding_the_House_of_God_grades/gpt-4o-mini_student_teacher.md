## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's answer a **80**.

While the student provided a thorough explanation of the term "house of God" in biblical context, they included both literal and spiritual meanings, as well as theological significance and biblical examples. The student also highlighted the importance of community and interdependence in the Christian faith. However, the focus of the reference answer provided by the teacher is more specific - emphasizing that the 'house of God' refers to a place where God is worshiped, specifically relating to the tabernacle or the temple. The student's answer could have more closely aligned with this specific biblical definition. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept, but could have better emphasized the worship aspect tied to the 'house of God' as indicated in the reference answer.
