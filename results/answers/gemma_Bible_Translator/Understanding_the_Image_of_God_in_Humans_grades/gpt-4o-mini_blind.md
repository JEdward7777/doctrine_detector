Grade: 85

Comment: This answer provides a solid overview of characteristics reflecting the image of God according to the biblical definition. The student appropriately references relevant Scriptures and outlines key traits such as creativity, moral responsibility, sociality, compassion, and stewardship. However, to enhance the depth of the response, it could benefit from more explicit connections to foundational Christian doctrines, such as the impact of the fall on humanity's ability to fully reflect God's image and the role of Christ in redeeming and restoring that image. Additionally, further emphasis on the importance of relationship with God as a central aspect of reflecting His image would strengthen the theological underpinning of the answer.
