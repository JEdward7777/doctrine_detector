  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of characteristics reflecting the image of God, including creativity, moral responsibility, sociality, physical and mental wholeness, compassion, integrity, and stewardship. However, the answer does not explicitly mention key characteristics like the ability to feel emotion, reason, communicate, and have an eternal spirit, which are highlighted in the reference answer. While the student's response is thorough, addressing additional characteristics from a biblical perspective would have strengthened the answer and aligned it more closely with the biblical definition of the image of God."
