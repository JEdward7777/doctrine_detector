  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively delves into the significance of the term 'kingdom of God' in the New Testament. They have touched on various key aspects such as eschatological reality, present reality, cosmic significance, relational concept, transformation and redemption, mission and evangelism, continuity and progression, and more. The student effectively relates the concept of the kingdom of God to God's sovereignty and authority in our lives. However, the answer lacks direct alignment with the teacher's reference answer that emphasizes God's spiritual rule over people and His authority over all creation. This deviation slightly detracts from the overall coherence with the specified concern."
