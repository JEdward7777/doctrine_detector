  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of the 'last days' in relation to both Jesus' first and second comings, supported by relevant biblical references. The explanation of the events surrounding each coming is accurate, and the mention of Christian beliefs aligns with mainstream interpretations. The response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications of these events and providing additional scriptural support. Overall, a good understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
