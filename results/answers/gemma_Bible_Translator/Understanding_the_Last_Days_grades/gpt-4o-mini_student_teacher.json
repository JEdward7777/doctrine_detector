  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the 'last days' in relation to both Jesus' first and second comings, supported by relevant biblical references. However, the student's answer elaborates on specific events and beliefs associated with the last days, which may be considered too detailed for a simple explanation required in a Christian worldview perspective. The focus should be on the overall understanding of the 'last days' timeline, which the student partially captures but could have been more succinct and aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
