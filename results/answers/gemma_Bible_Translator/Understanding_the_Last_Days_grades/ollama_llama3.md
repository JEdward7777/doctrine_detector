Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a clear understanding of the timeline of Jesus' first coming, second coming, and final judgment. However, it lacks specificity in defining what constitutes the "last days" during each period. The answer is more general than the concern requires, which focuses on understanding the timeline of major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the overall biblical narrative and its significance for Christian beliefs.

The response does not fully address the concern because it does not delve deeper into the specific events that mark the "last days" during Jesus' first coming and second coming. The response also does not discuss the implications of these events on Christian faith, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the timeline of major Biblical events. Nevertheless, the response shows a good foundation in biblical teachings and could be improved with more specificity and depth.
