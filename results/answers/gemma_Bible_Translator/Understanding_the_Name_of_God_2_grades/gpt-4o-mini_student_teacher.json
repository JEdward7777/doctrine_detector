  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-explained understanding of the significance of the name 'Yahweh' in the Old Testament, focusing on the covenant relationship between God and His people. The answer appropriately highlights God's faithfulness, unchanging love, and sovereignty over His people. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes that 'Yahweh' signifies God's eternal and self-existent nature, which the student's answer does not explicitly address. Despite this omission, the student demonstrates a strong grasp of the theological implications of God's name."
