  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive and well-structured overview of the differentiation between the human spirit and evil spirits based on biblical references. The student effectively captures the key distinctions in origin, purpose, and control between the two concepts. The explanation is clear and supported by relevant scriptures. However, the student could deepen the analysis by incorporating more biblical references to strengthen the argument further. Overall, it is a strong and well-articulated response from a Christian worldview."
