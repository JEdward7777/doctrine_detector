  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus' identity. The answer accurately highlights Jesus' unique humanity and connection to humanity, as well as the divine-human relationship. The student effectively explains the Messianic fulfillment aspect and the identification with humanity. However, there could be more emphasis on the scriptural basis for the title \"Son of Man\" and the specific Old Testament prophecies that Jesus fulfilled. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the cosmic significance in terms of Jesus' role as the mediator between God and humanity would enhance the answer."
