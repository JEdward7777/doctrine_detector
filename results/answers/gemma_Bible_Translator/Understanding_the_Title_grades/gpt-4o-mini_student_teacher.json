  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' from a Christian worldview, their interpretation lacks precision in accurately reflecting the full depth of Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine. The student correctly highlights Jesus' connection to humanity and humility through the title 'Son of Man,' but falls short in emphasizing the Messianic significance and the crucial aspect of Jesus' divine nature. Encouraging the student to further explore the unique theological significance of Jesus' title 'Son of Man' would enhance the accuracy and depth of their analysis."
