I would give this response a score of 85.

The response accurately captures the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the "Son of Man" in relation to his dual nature, emphasizing both his humanity and divinity. It also touches on the Messianic fulfillment aspect, highlighting Jesus' role as the Messiah. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept's connection to humanity, discussing Jesus' identification with ordinary people and his representative role in their relationship with God.

However, I deduct 10 points because the response does not explicitly address the concern about implications for our faith. While it touches on some aspects related to our faith, such as redemption and reconciliation, it would have been beneficial to explore these implications more deeply or provide specific examples of how this concept applies to everyday Christian life.

Overall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the theological significance of Jesus' self-identification as the "Son of Man," but could benefit from further development on its practical applications for our faith.
