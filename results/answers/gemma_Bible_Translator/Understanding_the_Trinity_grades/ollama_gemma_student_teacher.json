  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comments:** This is a well-written and thorough response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the complexities of the Trinity within a Christian worldview. The student clearly articulates the essential elements of the Trinity, including its relation to monotheism, the shared essence and distinct roles of the three persons, and the gradual revelation of the Trinity throughout scripture. The inclusion of relevant biblical passages further strengthens the response."
