**Consequences Pronounced on Ungodly People According to the Christian Bible:**

The Bible teaches that ungodly people face severe consequences from God. These consequences include:

**1. Separation from God:**
- God's love and fellowship are only for those who are righteous (2 Corinthians 6:14).
- Ungodly people are estranged from God and his presence (Isaiah 59:2).

**2. Judgment and Wrath:**
- God will judge the wicked and punish them for their sins (Revelation 20:12).
- Judgment will include physical punishment and spiritual separation from God (Matthew 25:46).

**3. Eternal Separation:**

- This separation is a complete and final destiny for those who reject God's love and forgiveness.

- They have no spiritual life or connection to God.

**6. Powerlessness and Despair:**
