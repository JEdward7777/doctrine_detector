The Bible teaches that ungodly people face severe consequences from God. These consequences include:

**1. Separation from God:**

- Ungodly people are estranged from God and his presence (Isaiah 59:2).

**2. Judgment and Wrath:**
- God will judge the wicked and punish them for their sins (Revelation 20:12).
- Judgment will include physical punishment and spiritual separation from God (Matthew 25:46).

**3. Eternal Separation:**
- Ungodly people will be eternally separated from God in hell (Eternal punishment for sin) (Matthew 25:46).
- This separation is a complete and final destiny for those who reject God's love and forgiveness.

**4. Loss of Blessings:**
- God's blessings and promises are only for those who are faithful to him (Matthew 7:21-27).
- Ungodly people will lose out on these blessings and rewards.

- Ungodly people are spiritually dead in their sins (Ephesians 2:1).
- They have no spiritual life or connection to God.

**6. Powerlessness and Despair:**
- The ungodly are powerless to change their circumstances or overcome sin (James 1:14).
- They experience despair and hopelessness because they lack God's love and guidance.
