**Consequences Pronounced on Ungodly People According to the Christian Bible:**

The Bible teaches that ungodly people face severe consequences from God. These consequences include:

**1. Separation from God:**
- God's love and fellowship are only for those who are righteous (2 Corinthians 6:14).
- Ungodly people are estranged from God and his presence (Isaiah 59:2).

**2. Judgment and Wrath:**
- God will judge the wicked and punish them for their sins (Revelation 20:12).
- Judgment will include physical punishment and spiritual separation from God (Matthew 25:46).

**3. Eternal Separation:**
- Ungodly people will be eternally separated from God in hell (Eternal punishment for sin) (Matthew 25:46).
- This separation is a complete and final destiny for those who reject God's love and forgiveness.

**4. Loss of Blessings:**
- God's blessings and promises are only for those who are faithful to him (Matthew 7:21-27).
- Ungodly people will lose out on these blessings and rewards.

**5. Spiritual Death:**
- Ungodly people are spiritually dead in their sins (Ephesians 2:1).
- They have no spiritual life or connection to God.

**6. Powerlessness and Despair:**
- The ungodly are powerless to change their circumstances or overcome sin (James 1:14).
- They experience despair and hopelessness because they lack God's love and guidance.

**7. God's Wrath on Sin:**
- God's wrath is poured out on sin and those who practice it (Romans 1:18).
- This wrath is a just response to the violation of God's law and the corruption of human nature.

**8. The Day of Reckoning:**
- Every ungodly person will stand before God on the Day of Judgment (Hebrews 9:27).
- Their actions will be evaluated and they will be held accountable for their sins.
