  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of the usage of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the primary references to God in the Old Testament and Jesus Christ in the New Testament. They have also touched upon the significance of the term when used for other beings or objects set apart for divine purposes. However, the student could improve their answer by explicitly mentioning the phrase 'Holy One of Israel' in the Old Testament and focusing more on the divinity and authority of Jesus as the 'Holy One' in the New Testament, in line with the concern provided."
