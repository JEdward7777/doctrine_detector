## Usage of the term "Holy One" in the Old and New Testaments:

**Old Testament:**

* **143 times:** Primarily refers to **God** as the source of holiness.
* **Examples:** Psalms 17:15, Isaiah 40:25, Lamentations 3:48.
* **Context:** Often emphasizes God's transcendence, uniqueness, and source of righteousness.

**New Testament:**

* **48 times:** Primarily refers to **Jesus Christ** as the ultimate expression of holiness.
* **Examples:** Hebrews 1:3, 1 Peter 1:16, Revelation 1:4.
* **Context:** Highlights Jesus' perfect sinlessness, divine nature, and role as the atoning sacrifice for sin.

**Additional Notes:**

* In both testaments, the term "Holy One" can also be used for other beings or objects that are set apart for divine purposes, such as people (Daniel), places (Temple), or things (Bread of Life).
* When referring to God or Jesus, the term "Holy One" often carries a sense of awe, reverence, and uniqueness.
* The term is often paired with other titles for God or Jesus, such as "Lord," "Savior," or "King."
