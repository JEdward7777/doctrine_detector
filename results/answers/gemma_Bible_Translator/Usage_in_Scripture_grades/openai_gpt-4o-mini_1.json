It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting Jesus as the ultimate expression of holiness and emphasizing His divine nature and role as the atoning sacrifice for sin. The additional notes provide further insights into the significance of the term. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the authority and divinity of Jesus as portrayed in the New Testament."
