However, it lacks depth and does not specifically tie the use of myrrh to any biblical events or references. To improve, the student could have referenced specific instances in the Bible where myrrh was used in burial practices, such as in the story of Jesus' burial in the New Testament. Additionally, the explanation could have delved into the symbolic significance of myrrh in Christian theology, highlighting its association with sacrifice and death, particularly in the context of Christ's crucifixion."
