  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer adequately explains the use of myrrh in burial practices in biblical times as an embalming agent and fragrance. It also acknowledges the cultural and religious influence on this practice. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the significance of myrrh in the anointing process and the respect given to the deceased, as suggested in the reference answer."
