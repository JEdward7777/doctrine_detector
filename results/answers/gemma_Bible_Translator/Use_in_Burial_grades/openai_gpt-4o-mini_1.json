It aligns well with the concern by emphasizing how understanding burial practices enhances comprehension of cultural contexts in scripture. The response could have been strengthened by showcasing how myrrh's use in burial practices reflects deeper spiritual and theological meanings, bringing in how this practice can relate to Christian beliefs in the afterlife or the importance of honoring the body as a temple of the Holy Spirit."
