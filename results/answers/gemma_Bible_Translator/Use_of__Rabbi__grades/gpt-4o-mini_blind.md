Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus are referred to as "Rabbi" in the biblical texts. The title "Rabbi" was typically used for teachers of Jewish law and tradition, and neither John nor Jesus were considered to be Pharisees or teachers in that sense.</start_of_turn>

80.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would give this answer a grade of 80. The student correctly explains that neither John the Baptist nor Jesus were referred to as "Rabbi" in the biblical texts and provides context on the typical usage of the title. However, the explanation could be strengthened by acknowledging that Jesus was sometimes referred to as "Rabbi" in a colloquial sense by his disciples and followers in the Gospels. Adding this nuance would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the use of the title in relation to Jesus.
