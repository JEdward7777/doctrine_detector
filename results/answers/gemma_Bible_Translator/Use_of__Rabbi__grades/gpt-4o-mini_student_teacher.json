  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student correctly identified that the title \"Rabbi\" was used for teachers of Jewish law and tradition, and acknowledged that John the Baptist and Jesus were not considered as such. However, the student missed the important point that both John the Baptist and Jesus were sometimes referred to as 'Rabbi' by their disciples, signifying their roles as spiritual teachers. It is important to recognize the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings, which the student did not fully address in their response."
