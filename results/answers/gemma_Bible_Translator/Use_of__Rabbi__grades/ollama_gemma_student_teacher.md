Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus are referred to as "Rabbi" in the biblical texts. The title "Rabbi" was typically used for teachers of Jewish law and tradition, and neither John nor Jesus were considered to be Pharisees or teachers in that sense.</start_of_turn>

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** While the student's answer is generally accurate in stating that neither John nor Jesus are explicitly referred to as "Rabbi" in the biblical texts, it fails to acknowledge the contextual and symbolic significance of the title within the Jewish tradition. The response could have further elaborated on the concept of "rabbinate" and its relevance to Jesus' and John's teachings.
