## Question [Use of 'Rabbi'](../../../questions/Use_of__Rabbi_.md)
How were John the Baptist and Jesus referred to concerning the title 'Rabbi'?

## Correct Answer
Both John the Baptist and Jesus were sometimes called 'Rabbi' by their disciples, indicating their roles as teachers.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings.

## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus are referred to as "Rabbi" in the biblical texts. The title "Rabbi" was typically used for teachers of Jewish law and tradition, and neither John nor Jesus were considered to be Pharisees or teachers in that sense.</start_of_turn>

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
30.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 30.

This response is incorrect in stating that both John the Baptist and Jesus were referred to as "Rabbi" by their disciples, when in fact neither of them are referred to with this title in the biblical texts. The concern about recognizing respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings is not addressed in this response.

The low grade is due to the lack of accuracy and failure to address the specified concern.
