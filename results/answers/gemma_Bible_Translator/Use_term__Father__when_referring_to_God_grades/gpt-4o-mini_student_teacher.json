  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response addressing the concern regarding potential misunderstandings when using the term \"Father\" to refer to God. They have effectively balanced the importance of theological accuracy with the need for clarity in communication. The student has demonstrated an understanding of the nuances involved in translating theological concepts and has offered practical alternatives for clarity in various contexts. While the student's answer is well-written and well-reasoned, the grade is slightly reduced to reflect the deviation from the teacher's specific Christian worldview, which emphasizes the necessity of using the term 'Father' and relying on teaching and context for clarification."
