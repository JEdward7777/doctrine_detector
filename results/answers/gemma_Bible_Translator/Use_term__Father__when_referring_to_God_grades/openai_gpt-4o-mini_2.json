The suggested alternatives provide helpful solutions to potential misunderstandings without compromising the scriptural message. The emphasis on context-sensitive decisions and the importance of maintaining the term \"Father\" in certain theological contexts align well with a Christian worldview. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern while upholding the integrity of biblical teachings."
