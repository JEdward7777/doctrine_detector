  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate list of parables used by Jesus to describe the value of the Kingdom of God. The explanations for each parable demonstrate a good understanding of the underlying spiritual and doctrinal messages conveyed by Jesus through these stories. One area for improvement could be to provide more biblical references or specific verses to support the interpretations given."
