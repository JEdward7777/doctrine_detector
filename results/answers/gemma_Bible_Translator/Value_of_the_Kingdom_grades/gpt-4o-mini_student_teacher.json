  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough list of parables used by Jesus to describe the value of the Kingdom of God, showcasing a strong understanding of the topic. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the central message that Jesus compared the kingdom of God to a mustard seed, yeast, hidden treasure, and a perfect pearl. Emphasizing this key point would have strengthened the overall coherence and relevance of the response."
