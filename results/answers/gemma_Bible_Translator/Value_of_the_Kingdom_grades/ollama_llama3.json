While mentioning a few examples of Jesus' comparisons (mustard seed, yeast, hidden treasure, perfect pearl), the response does not fully convey the transformative power and immense worth of the kingdom of God as described in the original text. The concern is to appreciate the worth and significance of the kingdom of God in our lives, but the response only touches on this aspect briefly."
