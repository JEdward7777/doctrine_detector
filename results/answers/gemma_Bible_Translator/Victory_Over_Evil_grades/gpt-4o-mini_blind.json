  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the promise God gives regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan, citing relevant Bible passages and explaining their significance. The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of the biblical perspective on this topic. However, the explanation could be strengthened by focusing more on the specific language and context of the passages cited, as well as emphasizing the centrality of Christ in Satan's defeat. Additionally, a clearer connection between the cited passages and the ultimate defeat of Satan would enhance the clarity and coherence of the response."
