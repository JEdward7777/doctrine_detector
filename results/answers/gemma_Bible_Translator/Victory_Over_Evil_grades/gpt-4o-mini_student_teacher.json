  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed response citing relevant Bible passages, explaining the promise of the defeat of Satan through Christ's sacrifice, ultimate dominion, and the liberation of believers. However, the specific promise from Genesis about the Messiah defeating Satan completely and crushing his power forever was not directly addressed in the answer. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and integrated Christian worldview perspectives effectively."
