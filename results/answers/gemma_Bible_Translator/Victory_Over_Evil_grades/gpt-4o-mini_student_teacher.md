## Question [Victory Over Evil](../../../questions/Victory_Over_Evil.md)
What promise does God give regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan?

## Correct Answer
God promised that one of Eveâ€™s descendants, referring to the Messiah, would defeat Satan completely and crush his power forever.

## Stated Concern
This promise offers hope and assurance to Christians about God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph over evil.

## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible offers several promises regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan. Here are two key passages:

**1. Revelation 20:10:** "The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire."

This passage clearly states that Satan will ultimately be thrown into the lake of fire, which represents his permanent destruction and defeat.

**2. 1 John 3:8:** "No victory over sin and death rests in the flesh, but in this: the Son has overcome the world, and he offers us victory through his blood."

This passage emphasizes that Jesus' sacrifice overcame the power of sin and death, which includes Satan's influence. This victory is ultimately for all who believe in him.

**Other relevant passages:**

* **Psalm 109:6:** "I will pray for the peace of your people; their enemies will be vanquished and all who oppose you will flee from you."
* **Daniel 7:21:** "One of the saints will dominate the kingdoms of the earth, and he will be given eternal dominion." (This refers to Christ's ultimate victory over all earthly powers.)
* **2 Corinthians 4:4:** "The god of this world has blinded them, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ." (This suggests that Satan's influence will eventually be broken and Christ will be glorified.)

**Therefore, God promises the ultimate defeat of Satan through:**

* Christ's sacrifice and victory over sin and death
* His ultimate dominion over the earth
* The downfall of Satan and his demonic forces
* The liberation of those who are currently under Satan's influence

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed response citing relevant Bible passages, explaining the promise of the defeat of Satan through Christ's sacrifice, ultimate dominion, and the liberation of believers. However, the specific promise from Genesis about the Messiah defeating Satan completely and crushing his power forever was not directly addressed in the answer. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and integrated Christian worldview perspectives effectively.
