  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and articulate explanation of how Jesus' death on the cross diminishes Satan's dominion, drawing from relevant biblical references. However, the student's answer could have been improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern of understanding Christ's victory and its impact on believers' spiritual lives, as highlighted in the reference answer. The response touched on this aspect but could have delved deeper into how Christ's victory over Satan directly influences and empowers believers in their daily spiritual walk."
