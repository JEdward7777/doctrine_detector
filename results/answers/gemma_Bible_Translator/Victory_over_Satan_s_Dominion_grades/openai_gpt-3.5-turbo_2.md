# Answer by [gemma Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
**Jesus' death on the cross significantly diminishes Satan's dominion in several ways:**

**1. Cosmic Reconciliation:**

* Jesus' death reconciled God and creation (Colossians 1:20). 
* This reconciliation includes the spiritual realm, where Satan exerts his influence. 
* Through Christ's sacrifice, the power of sin and death over the cosmos is broken.

**2. Satan's Power Subdued:**

* Jesus' death disarmed and conquered Satan's authority (1 John 3:8). 
* The power of his lies and temptations is weakened. 
* Christians are not overcome by fear or temptation because of Christ's victory.

**3. Redemption of God's Creation:**

* Jesus' sacrifice redeems God's creation from the curse of sin (Romans 8:21). 
* This redemption includes the spiritual realm, liberating it from Satan's domination.

**4. Ultimate Triumph:**

* Jesus' death and resurrection demonstrate God's ultimate triumph over sin and death (1 Corinthians 15:57). 
* This victory includes overcoming Satan's power and dominion.

**5. Hope and Freedom:**

* Christians who believe in Jesus receive the hope of eternal life and freedom from Satan's influence (John 3:16). 
* This freedom empowers them to resist temptation and live lives that honor God.

**Therefore, Jesus' death on the cross is central to the defeat of Satan's dominion and the restoration of all things in Christ.**
