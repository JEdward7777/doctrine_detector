  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's response a grade of 75.\n\nWhile the student's answer provides a thorough and detailed list of actionable ways Christians can honor God in their daily lives, it lacks a clear emphasis on the central theme provided in the reference answer from the teacher. The student's response explores various aspects of Christian living and practical applications of faith, but it does not directly focus on the core elements of thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and showcasing His greatness.\n\nWhile the student's answer is comprehensive and covers a wide range of practical ways to honor God in daily life, it could benefit from more direct alignment with the central theme outlined in the reference answer."
