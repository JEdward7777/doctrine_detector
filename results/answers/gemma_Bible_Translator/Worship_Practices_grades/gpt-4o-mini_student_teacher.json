  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30 \n\nComment: The student's response fails to address the question from a Christian perspective. As Christians are called to discern and guard against idol worship, it is essential to acknowledge and address potential modern idols that may hinder a relationship with God. The answer lacks depth and insight into the specific concerns raised in the question. A more robust response should have offered examples of modern idols and emphasized the importance of self-reflection and prioritizing devotion to God."
