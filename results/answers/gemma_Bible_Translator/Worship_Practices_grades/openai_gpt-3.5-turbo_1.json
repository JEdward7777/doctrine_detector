However, the initial response failed to address the concern raised, which is essential for Christians to reflect on and ensure their devotion to God remains central in their lives. Encouraging self-examination in light of potential idol worship is crucial for spiritual growth and maturity. This aspect could have been incorporated for a more thorough Christian perspective."
