## Answer given by [gemma Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gemma_Bible_Translator.md)
## Why are people created to worship God?

The Bible teaches that people are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), and that this implies a deep-seated need within us to relate to and worship a divine being. This worship is not simply about performing rituals, but about loving and honoring God with every aspect of our lives.

The Westminster Confession of Faith summarizes this beautifully:

> "Man, in his unfallen state, is sinful and unclean in his thoughts, words, and works; and is totally unable to save himself by his own works or merit."

In other words, our sinful nature prevents us from achieving righteousness on our own. We need the grace and forgiveness of God, which we can only receive through worship and love.

## What does the Bible say about false gods?

The Bible is replete with warnings against the practice of idolatry and the worship of false gods. These warnings are found throughout the Old and New Testaments.

**Some of the key passages addressing false gods include:**

* **Exodus 20:** "You shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth beneath; you shall not worship them."
* **1 Corinthians 10:14:** "Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry."
* **Revelation 21:27:** "And as for the idolaters and all the liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire."

The Bible teaches that:

* **False gods are not real:** They are merely human inventions, and do not possess any power or authority.
* **Worshiping false gods is harmful:** It ultimately leads to spiritual emptiness and eternal judgment.
* **True worship belongs only to the one true God:** The creator of heaven and earth, and the only one who can forgive sin and grant eternal life.

The Bible urges us to turn away from the false gods of this world and to worship the one true God, who is a perfect and loving Father.
