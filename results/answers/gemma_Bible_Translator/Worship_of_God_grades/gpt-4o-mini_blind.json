  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The answer provides a solid foundation rooted in Scripture and the Westminster Confession of Faith regarding the purpose of worship and the sinfulness of humanity. The explanation of false gods and idolatry is supported by relevant Bible verses and conveys the importance of worshiping the one true God. However, to improve, the student could delve deeper into the consequences of idol worship and emphasize the exclusivity of worshiping God as revealed in the Bible. Additionally, further elaboration on how worship is a response to God's grace and redemption would enrich the answer."
