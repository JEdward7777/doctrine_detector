  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of zeal in the context of Christian teachings. The answer effectively captures the essence of zeal as passionately upholding and defending Christian beliefs, with reference to biblical examples and practical applications. The emphasis on love, humility, and the role of the Holy Spirit in motivating zeal is commendable. However, the student could have tied back their points more explicitly to the idea of promoting a good cause in obeying God and teaching others, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and well-articulated response that demonstrates a good understanding of zeal within a Christian worldview."
