  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer showcasing the historical significance of Mount Zion for King David. They effectively connected key biblical events and figures to Mount Zion, demonstrating a strong understanding of its importance in the biblical narrative. However, the reference answer from the teacher highlighted the initial significance of Mount Zion as a stronghold captured by King David, which the student did not explicitly address. This omission slightly detracts from the overall completeness of the response."
