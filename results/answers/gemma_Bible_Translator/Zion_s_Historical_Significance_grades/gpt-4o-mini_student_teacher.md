**1. David's Throne and Royal Residence:**

* Mount Zion was the location of David's palace and throne room.

**2. Temple of the Most High:**

* This act solidified David's dynasty and foreshadowed the future exaltation of Jesus Christ as the ultimate temple and sacrifice.

**3. David's Sacrifice and Covenant:**

* After obtaining the Ark, David established a daily sacrifice on Mount Zion. 
* This sacrificial practice symbolized David's personal covenant with God and foreshadowed the need for a sinless sacrifice for forgiveness of sins.

**4. David's Anointing:**

* Mount Zion was the site of David's anointing as king by the prophet Samuel (1 Samuel 16:13). 
* This event established David as the rightful heir to the throne and foreshadowed Christ's anointing as the King of Kings.

**5. David's Lament:**

* After David's sin with Bathsheba and the subsequent death of her husband, he expressed his remorse on Mount Zion (2 Samuel 12:1-3).

Grade: 90

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer showcasing the historical significance of Mount Zion for King David. They effectively connected key biblical events and figures to Mount Zion, demonstrating a strong understanding of its importance in the biblical narrative. However, the reference answer from the teacher highlighted the initial significance of Mount Zion as a stronghold captured by King David, which the student did not explicitly address. This omission slightly detracts from the overall completeness of the response.
