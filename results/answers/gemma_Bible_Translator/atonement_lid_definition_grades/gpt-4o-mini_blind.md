Comment: The answer lacks doctrinal correctness as there is biblical evidence to support the concept of the "atonement lid," which is also known as the mercy seat, in the context of the ark of the covenant. The student should have taken the opportunity to explain the significance of the atonement lid based on biblical teachings.
