  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student correctly identified the lack of biblical evidence for the term \"atonement lid,\" but failed to provide any additional information or analysis on the significance of the mercy seat in the context of the ark of the covenant. There was an opportunity to elaborate on the concept of God's mercy and atonement as depicted in the Old Testament, which was crucial for a complete answer from a Christian worldview perspective. The student's response was partially accurate but lacked depth and engagement with the given concern."
