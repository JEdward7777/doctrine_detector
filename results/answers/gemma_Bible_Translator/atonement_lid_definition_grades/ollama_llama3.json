However, it falls short in terms of fully grasping the significance of the mercy seat (atonement lid) as described in the concern. The response only mentions God's mercy and atonement, but does not explicitly connect this to the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament. Additionally, it does not provide any specific biblical references or explanations to support its understanding, which limits its value."
