Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately explains the significance of the atonement lid (mercy seat) in representing God's mercy and the role of the high priest in mediating on behalf of the people. The student correctly addresses the concern of understanding the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament. However, deducting a small amount because it would have been stronger if the student also acknowledged the biblical reference of the atonement lid as described in Exodus 25:17-22.
