  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and thoughtful, providing an interesting perspective from an Islamic viewpoint. However, the student did not address the question from a Christian perspective, which is necessary for a complete and accurate answer. The significance of the 'abomination of desolation' in Christianity is tied to rebellion against God and the defilement of sacred spaces, as stated in the reference answer. To improve, the student should focus on addressing the question through a Christian lens and providing insights specific to Christian beliefs and teachings."
