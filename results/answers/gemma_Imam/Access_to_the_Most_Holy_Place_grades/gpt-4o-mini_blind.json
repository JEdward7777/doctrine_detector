  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The answer provided is inaccurate from a Christian perspective as it discusses Islamic traditions regarding the most holy place, the Kaaba. The content does not align with the Christian worldview, and thus does not address the question asked. To improve, the student needs to focus on providing a response based on Christian beliefs and teachings regarding the most holy place."
