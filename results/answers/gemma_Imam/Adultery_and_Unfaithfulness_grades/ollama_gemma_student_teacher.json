  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of unfaithfulness in Islamic law and its implications within marriage. The student clearly articulates the various types of unfaithfulness and their consequences, while also connecting the concept to the Islamic principles of marriage. However, the connection to Israel's unfaithfulness to God lacks textual evidence from the provided text and may be beyond the scope of the Christian specific worldview."
