* **Divorce:** The Quran allows for divorce as a consequence of unfaithfulness.
* **Retribution:** The injured spouse may seek retribution from the unfaithful spouse.
* **Psychological and emotional damage:** Unfaithfulness can cause significant psychological and emotional damage to the affected spouse and family.

**Relationship to Islamic principles of marriage:**

The concept of unfaithfulness is closely related to the Islamic principles of marriage, which are based on:

* **Honesty:** Spouses are expected to be honest and truthful with each other.
* **Loyalty:** Spouses are expected to be loyal to each other and commit to the marital relationship.
* **Purity:** Islamic law emphasizes the importance of purity and chastity within marriage.
