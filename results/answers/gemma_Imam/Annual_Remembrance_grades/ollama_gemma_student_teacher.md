Why were the Israelites commanded to celebrate Passover every year according to the Bible?

The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year to remember God's victory over the Egyptians and their deliverance from slavery.

Recognizing the importance of remembrance in Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The celebration of Passover is not commanded in the Quran or Islamic tradition. It is a religious practice specific to Judaism.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 60/100

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly points out that Passover is a religious practice specific to Judaism, however, it ignores the concern related to remembrance in Christian faith. The response would benefit from acknowledging the significance of remembrance in Christian faith and connecting it to the biblical account of Passover as a reminder of God's deliverance of the Israelites.
