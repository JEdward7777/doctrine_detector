# Grade of [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md) for model [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md) for question [Annual Remembrance](../../../questions/Annual_Remembrance.md)

## Question [Annual Remembrance](../../../questions/Annual_Remembrance.md)
Why were the Israelites commanded to celebrate Passover every year according to the Bible?

## Correct Answer
The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year to remember God's victory over the Egyptians and their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of remembrance in Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The celebration of Passover is not commanded in the Quran or Islamic tradition. It is a religious practice specific to Judaism.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response accurately points out that Passover is not commanded in Islamic tradition, which shows an understanding of the importance of remembrance in Christian faith (the concern). It also correctly identifies Passover as a Jewish practice, demonstrating an awareness of the biblical account and its significance. The only deduction is that it does not explicitly connect the importance of remembrance to Christian faith, which was the primary concern.

Comment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account and its relationship to other religious traditions. It would be improved by explicitly highlighting the importance of remembrance in Christian faith, such as mentioning Jesus' use of the Passover as a foreshadowing of his sacrifice or emphasizing the idea that God's people have been set free from slavery through Christ.
