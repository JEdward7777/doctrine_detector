Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the significance of Passover in Judaism, highlighting the importance of remembrance of God's deliverance. It aligns well with the Christian worldview's emphasis on remembering God's faithfulness and works in history. The deduction in points is due to the lack of direct application to Christian faith specifically, which could have strengthened the answer further.
