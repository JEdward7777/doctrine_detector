  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComments:\n1. The response inaccurately portrays the significance of the apostles in spreading the gospel as being in Islam, while the original question pertains to Christianity. This misinterpretation significantly deviates from Christian doctrine and the foundational role of the apostles in the Christian faith.\n2. The content of the response also incorrectly aligns the apostles' role with Islamic beliefs, rather than discussing their crucial role in establishing and spreading Christianity as intended by Jesus.\n3. The response lacks a Christian worldview perspective and fails to address the doctrinal significance of the apostles' mission in spreading the gospel as stewards of Jesus' teachings within Christian faith.\n4. The overall misunderstanding of the question and failure to provide a Christian-specific response greatly impacts the accuracy and relevance, resulting in a low grade."
