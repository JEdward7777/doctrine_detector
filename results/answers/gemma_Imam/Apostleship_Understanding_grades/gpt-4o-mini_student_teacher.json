  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the gospel, but the answer strays from a Christian worldview by mentioning Islam and Islamic tradition extensively. While the student makes some valid points about the apostles' authenticity, credibility, guidance, and connection to Jesus, the answer lacks a strong focus on the Christian perspective and the specific context of the Great Commission. Moreover, there is a notable absence of citing relevant biblical passages or Christian theological concepts. The answer could be improved by emphasizing the apostles' role in fulfilling Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations and how their mission laid the foundation for the spread of Christianity."
