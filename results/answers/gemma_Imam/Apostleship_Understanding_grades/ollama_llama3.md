Grade: 60%

The response provides some accurate information about the apostles' role in spreading the gospel, but it lacks depth and clarity in addressing the concern of understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission.

Strengths:

* The response acknowledges the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus.
* It recognizes their importance in preaching about God and his kingdom.
* The mention of the apostles' authority as carrying the same authority as Christ himself is a positive aspect.

Weaknesses:
