It addresses the concern about the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission by emphasizing the apostles' crucial mission for the establishment and expansion of the early church. The explanation is detailed, supported by relevant points, and integrates Islamic perspectives as well. A minor improvement could be to provide more direct biblical references to enhance the Christian worldview perspective. Overall, a strong and well-rounded analysis."
