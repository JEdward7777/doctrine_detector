It discusses the authenticity and credibility brought by the apostles' eyewitness testimony, their role in guidance and interpretation, their efforts in expanding outreach, the establishment of the early Church, their close connection to Jesus, and their role in inspiring and guiding believers. The integration of Islamic perspective and recognition of the apostles as messengers of God adds a unique and thoughtful dimension to the response. The only minor area of improvement could be further elaboration on how the apostles' message specifically relates to the fulfillment of the Great Commission as given by Jesus."
