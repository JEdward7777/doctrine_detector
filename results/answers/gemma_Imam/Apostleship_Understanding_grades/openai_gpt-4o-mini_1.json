It emphasizes the authenticity, credibility, guidance, interpretation, expansion, establishment of the Church, connection to Jesus, and inspiration provided by the apostles. The response accurately connects these points to the role of apostleship in fulfilling Jesus' command to preach about God and his kingdom. The inclusion of Islamic perspectives adds depth and relevance to the discussion. The response could be strengthened by further elaborating on the specific teachings and actions of the apostles as they carried out their mission in fulfillment of the Great Commission."
