  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful answer outlining practical ways Christians can apply the principle of reconciliation in their relationships with others. The response addresses the concern by offering specific actions and behaviors that embody the concept of reconciliation in daily life. However, the answer could have more directly connected these actions to reflecting God's compassionate love and forgiveness, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a strong effort with room for further alignment with the Christian worldview perspective."
