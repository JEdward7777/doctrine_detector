  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies Michael as the only angel referred to as an 'archangel' in the Bible. However, the mention of Michael in the Quran, while interesting, does not directly address the concern raised about the influence of recognizing Michael's unique position on understanding spiritual warfare and intercession. Therefore, a slightly lower grade is given for not fully addressing the specific concern from a Christian worldview."
