20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 20.

Comment: The student correctly mentions that the Ark of the Covenant is primarily associated with biblical Christianity. However, the answer does not directly address the specific concern of understanding the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God within the tabernacle. The student's response lacks the necessary information related to the location of the Ark and its significance within the context of God's presence in the tabernacle.
