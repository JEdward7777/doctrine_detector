However, the answer falls short doctrinally as it lacks the foundational Christian belief in the Ark's historical and theological importance within the biblical narrative. The perspective provided is informative, but it does not align with a Christian worldview that acknowledges the Ark as a sacred vessel of God's covenant with His people in the Old Testament."
