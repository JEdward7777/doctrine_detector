The interpretation of the Ark as a metaphor for spiritual sanctuary or a believer's heart is well articulated. While the response does not directly address the importance of God's laws and His relationship with His chosen people as highlighted in the concern, it effectively presents a rich understanding of the Ark's symbolic significance in Islam."
