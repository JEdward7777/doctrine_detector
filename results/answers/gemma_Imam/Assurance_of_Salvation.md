## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The Islamic perspective recognizes the belief in Jesus (Isa) as a prophet of God.** The Quran affirms his miraculous deeds and teachings. 

**Regarding assurance for those who believe in Jesus:**

* **Faith in Allah and his messengers is the foundation of salvation in Islam.** Belief in Jesus is not a replacement for belief in Muhammad or the Quran.
* **Islam emphasizes monotheism and submission to the will of Allah.** This is considered the ultimate assurance for the believer.
* **Allah's mercy is vast and encompasses all those who fear him and do good.** Belief in Jesus can be part of a sincere and complete submission to Allah.

**However, Islam teaches that salvation is ultimately through submission to Allah's law and following the guidance of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad.** 

**Therefore, while belief in Jesus can be a part of a Muslim's faith, it is the comprehensive Islamic belief system that provides assurance and salvation.**
