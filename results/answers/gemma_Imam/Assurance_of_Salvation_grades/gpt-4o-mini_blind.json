However, from a Christian worldview, the assurance given to those who believe in Jesus is centered on the belief that Jesus is the Son of God, the Savior of humanity who died on the cross for the forgiveness of sins, and rose again, providing eternal life to those who have faith in Him. The response did not address the Christian understanding of assurance in Jesus specifically, which is crucial for this question."
