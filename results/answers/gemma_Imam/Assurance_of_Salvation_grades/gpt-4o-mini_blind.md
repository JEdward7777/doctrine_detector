## Stated Concern
Reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus.

## [Answer](../Assurance_of_Salvation.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The Islamic perspective recognizes the belief in Jesus (Isa) as a prophet of God.** The Quran affirms his miraculous deeds and teachings. 

**Regarding assurance for those who believe in Jesus:**

* **Faith in Allah and his messengers is the foundation of salvation in Islam.** Belief in Jesus is not a replacement for belief in Muhammad or the Quran.
* **Islam emphasizes monotheism and submission to the will of Allah.** This is considered the ultimate assurance for the believer.
* **Allah's mercy is vast and encompasses all those who fear him and do good.** Belief in Jesus can be part of a sincere and complete submission to Allah.

**However, Islam teaches that salvation is ultimately through submission to Allah's law and following the guidance of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad.** 

**Therefore, while belief in Jesus can be a part of a Muslim's faith, it is the comprehensive Islamic belief system that provides assurance and salvation.**

Grade: 60

Comment: The answer provided a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus (Isa) as a prophet of God and emphasized the importance of faith in Allah and submission to His will for salvation. However, from a Christian worldview, the assurance given to those who believe in Jesus is centered on the belief that Jesus is the Son of God, the Savior of humanity who died on the cross for the forgiveness of sins, and rose again, providing eternal life to those who have faith in Him. The response did not address the Christian understanding of assurance in Jesus specifically, which is crucial for this question.
