## Question [Assurance of Salvation](../../../questions/Assurance_of_Salvation.md)
What assurance is given to those who believe in Jesus?

## Correct Answer
If you believe in Jesus and what He has done for you, you are a Christian, and God has forgiven your sins because of what Jesus did.

## Stated Concern
Reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus.

## [Answer](../Assurance_of_Salvation.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The Islamic perspective recognizes the belief in Jesus (Isa) as a prophet of God.** The Quran affirms his miraculous deeds and teachings. 

**Regarding assurance for those who believe in Jesus:**

* **Faith in Allah and his messengers is the foundation of salvation in Islam.** Belief in Jesus is not a replacement for belief in Muhammad or the Quran.
* **Islam emphasizes monotheism and submission to the will of Allah.** This is considered the ultimate assurance for the believer.
* **Allah's mercy is vast and encompasses all those who fear him and do good.** Belief in Jesus can be part of a sincere and complete submission to Allah.

**However, Islam teaches that salvation is ultimately through submission to Allah's law and following the guidance of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad.** 

**Therefore, while belief in Jesus can be a part of a Muslim's faith, it is the comprehensive Islamic belief system that provides assurance and salvation.**

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided from an Islamic perspective offers important insights on the belief in Jesus within Islam and assurance for believers. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer given centers on the foundational belief that salvation in Christianity is through faith in Jesus and His sacrifice for our sins. This response falls short of addressing the concern of reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus, as it does not align with the core Christian belief in Jesus as the exclusive means of salvation.
