However, the response from an Islamic perspective emphasizes the importance of submission to Allah's law and following the guidance of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad. While both perspectives are valid within their respective belief systems, the Islamic viewpoint does not provide reassurance for believers through faith in Jesus as the Christian perspective does."
