It is important to emphasize the Christian belief in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone, rather than suggesting assurance through adherence to Islamic teachings. The response should focus on the uniqueness of Jesus as the Savior and the centrality of faith in Him for salvation, in accordance with Christian beliefs."
