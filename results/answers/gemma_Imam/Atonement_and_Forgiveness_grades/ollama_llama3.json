The answer accurately reflects the Christian doctrine, emphasizing the sacrificial nature of atonement and its connection to forgiveness and reconciliation.\n\nHowever, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical foundations and nuances of each concept, providing more detailed explanations and supporting scriptures.
