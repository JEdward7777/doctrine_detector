  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the concept of genuine love as outlined in Romans 12:9, emphasizing authenticity, transparency, consistency, humility, and selflessness in expressing love. The additional considerations provided on cultural sensitivity, motivation, and continuous growth further enhance the depth of understanding in applying this biblical principle. The response successfully addresses the concern by highlighting how living out genuine love aligns with being authentic representatives of Christ's love in the world. However, incorporating more direct references to Christian theology or scripture could strengthen the Christian-specific worldview aspect of the response."
