Comment: 
This response provides a comprehensive explanation of divine authority in Islam and its significance in the life of a believer. The student effectively outlines various aspects such as faith foundation, decision-making, accountability, guidance, belief reinforcement, unity, and purpose fulfillment. However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to note that the concept of divine authority in Islam differs significantly from the Christian understanding, particularly in terms of the authority of Scripture, the Triune nature of God, and the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate authority. The response could benefit from addressing these doctrinal differences.
