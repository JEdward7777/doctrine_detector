  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-organized explanation of the significance of divine authority in the life of a believer, focusing on key aspects such as understanding of faith, decision-making, accountability, guidance, belief reinforcement, unity, community, and fulfillment of purpose. The answer aligns well with the concern provided and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the response primarily focused on Islamic perspectives rather than a Christian-specific worldview, which could have strengthened the connection to the given reference answer."
