The points made effectively promote the understanding of how divine authority influences believers' moral and spiritual decisions, aligning with the concern provided. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate specific references to Islamic scripture or teachings to further strengthen the Christian worldview perspective on divine authority."
