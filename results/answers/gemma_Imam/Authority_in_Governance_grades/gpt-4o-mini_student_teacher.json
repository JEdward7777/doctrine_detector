  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that addresses the authority of governing rulers from a biblical perspective. They have incorporated relevant Bible verses and explained the responsibilities of rulers and citizens. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. Additionally, providing more direct comparison and analysis of the student's points with the reference answer would strengthen the response."
