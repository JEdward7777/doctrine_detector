  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good foundation for understanding the biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers, but could be more comprehensive in its discussion. The answer is focused on Romans 13:1-2 and does not touch on other relevant passages such as 1 Timothy 2:1-2 or 1 Peter 2:13, which provide further insight into the nature of authority and our responsibility to obey. Additionally, while the response mentions that rulers are accountable to God for their actions, it could be more explicit in its discussion of the importance of prayer (1 Timothy 2:1-2) as a means of seeking guidance and wisdom in matters related to governance.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical perspective on authority, but could benefit from further development and integration with other relevant passages."
