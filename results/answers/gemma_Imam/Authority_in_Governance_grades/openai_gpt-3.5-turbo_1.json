  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers, referencing a variety of relevant verses and addressing the established limits of authority based on a Christian worldview. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points discussed. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate a more direct connection back to the initial statement about governing rulers being established by God in Romans 13:1-2 throughout the response."
