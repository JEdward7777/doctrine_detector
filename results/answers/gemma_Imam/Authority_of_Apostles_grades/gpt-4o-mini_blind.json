The response talks about the authority of the apostles being derived from Allah and delivering the Islamic message, which conflicts with the Christian belief that the authority of the apostles comes from Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The mention of miracles being a sign of divinely appointed status and bold preaching reflecting unwavering faith in Allah does not align with the Christian understanding of apostolic authority being rooted in Jesus Christ, his teachings, and the power of the Holy Spirit. The conclusion drawn about the authority of the apostles is not consistent with Christian beliefs. The answer would benefit from reframing with a Christian worldview perspective."
