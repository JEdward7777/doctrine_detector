## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The authority of the apostles stems from their divinely ordained mission, not from their ability to perform miracles or preach boldly.**

**1. Divine Mandate:**

* The apostles were chosen by Allah to deliver the Islamic message and establish the Muslim community.
* Their authority comes from Allah's direct revelation and guidance.

**2. Miracle-Performing:**

* The performance of miracles was a sign of the apostles' divinely appointed status.
* However, the primary purpose of miracles was to authenticate their message and demonstrate Allah's power.
* They were not the ultimate source of authority.

**3. Bold Preaching:**

* The apostles were tasked with conveying the message of Islam fearlessly and confidently.
* Their boldness was a reflection of their unwavering faith and their confidence in Allah's message.
* It was not their physical prowess or eloquence that established their authority.

**4. Authenticating the Message:**

* The miracles and bold preaching of the apostles served as witnesses to the authenticity of their message.
* Their words and actions became a testament to the divine origin of Islam.

**5. Permanent Authority:**

* The authority of the apostles endures beyond their physical presence.
* Their teachings and guidance remain relevant and binding for Muslims today.

**Conclusion:**

The authority of the apostles lies in their divinely ordained mission, not in their miraculous abilities or rhetorical prowess. Their miracles and bold preaching were signs of their divinely appointed status and served to authenticate their message, but they were not the ultimate source of their authority.

Comments: This answer is based on Islamic beliefs and does not align with Christian doctrine. The response talks about the authority of the apostles being derived from Allah and delivering the Islamic message, which conflicts with the Christian belief that the authority of the apostles comes from Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The mention of miracles being a sign of divinely appointed status and bold preaching reflecting unwavering faith in Allah does not align with the Christian understanding of apostolic authority being rooted in Jesus Christ, his teachings, and the power of the Holy Spirit. The conclusion drawn about the authority of the apostles is not consistent with Christian beliefs. The answer would benefit from reframing with a Christian worldview perspective.
