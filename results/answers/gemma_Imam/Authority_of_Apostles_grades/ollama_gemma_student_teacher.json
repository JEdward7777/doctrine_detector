  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the relationship between the authority of the apostles and their miraculous abilities. However, it deviates from the Christian-specific worldview provided in the reference answer. The student's response draws on Islamic concepts such as Allah and the Muslim community, which are not relevant to the Christian context. Additionally, the student's explanation of the apostles' authority resting solely on their divinely ordained mission ignores the significance of their exemplary lives and teachings in establishing their authority."
