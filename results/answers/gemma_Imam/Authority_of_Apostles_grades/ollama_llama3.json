The provided answer emphasizes the apostles' empowerment by God to preach the gospel, heal people, and cast out demons, whereas the response focuses on the apostles' divinely ordained mission, miracle-performing, and bold preaching as the sources of their authority. Additionally, the concern is about exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, which is not thoroughly addressed in the response.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to incorporate more biblical and theological insights that connect the apostles' ministries to Jesus' commission and their subsequent empowerment by God."
