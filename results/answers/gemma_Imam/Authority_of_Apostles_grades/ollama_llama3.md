## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The authority of the apostles stems from their divinely ordained mission, not from their ability to perform miracles or preach boldly.**

**1. Divine Mandate:**

* The apostles were chosen by Allah to deliver the Islamic message and establish the Muslim community.
* Their authority comes from Allah's direct revelation and guidance.

**2. Miracle-Performing:**

* The performance of miracles was a sign of the apostles' divinely appointed status.
* However, the primary purpose of miracles was to authenticate their message and demonstrate Allah's power.
* They were not the ultimate source of authority.

**3. Bold Preaching:**

* The apostles were tasked with conveying the message of Islam fearlessly and confidently.
* Their boldness was a reflection of their unwavering faith and their confidence in Allah's message.
* It was not their physical prowess or eloquence that established their authority.

**4. Authenticating the Message:**

* The miracles and bold preaching of the apostles served as witnesses to the authenticity of their message.
* Their words and actions became a testament to the divine origin of Islam.

**5. Permanent Authority:**

* The authority of the apostles endures beyond their physical presence.
* Their teachings and guidance remain relevant and binding for Muslims today.

**Conclusion:**

The authority of the apostles lies in their divinely ordained mission, not in their miraculous abilities or rhetorical prowess. Their miracles and bold preaching were signs of their divinely appointed status and served to authenticate their message, but they were not the ultimate source of their authority.

Comment: While the response provides some relevant information about the apostles' authority, it does not align well with the given answer or concern. The provided answer emphasizes the apostles' empowerment by God to preach the gospel, heal people, and cast out demons, whereas the response focuses on the apostles' divinely ordained mission, miracle-performing, and bold preaching as the sources of their authority. Additionally, the concern is about exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, which is not thoroughly addressed in the response.

To improve this response, it would be helpful to incorporate more biblical and theological insights that connect the apostles' ministries to Jesus' commission and their subsequent empowerment by God.
