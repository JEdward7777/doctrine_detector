  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the difference in theological understanding between Islamic and Jewish/Christian traditions regarding the term 'Yahweh of hosts.' However, the student did not address the concern of understanding God's authority in relation to deepening faith and trust in His omnipotence. The answer is well-researched and informative but lacks application to the specified concern."
