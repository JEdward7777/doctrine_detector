## [Answer](../Authority_of_God.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The term 'Yahweh of hosts' (بِالْيَهُوَ الْجُامِع) is not a concept explicitly found within mainstream Islamic theology or scripture. It is primarily used in Jewish and Christian traditions.

**In those traditions:**

* **Yahweh** refers to the proper name of God in Hebrew.
* **Hosts** signifies spiritual beings, such as angels or demons.

The phrase suggests that God has authority and dominion over all spiritual beings.

**However, in the Islamic context:**

* Islamic theology emphasizes the oneness of God (tawhid) and rejects the concept of multiple deities or spiritual beings.
* The Islamic belief in angels aligns with the concept of created beings subservient to God, but it does not suggest that they are independent or possess the same kind of sovereignty as God.

Therefore, the term 'Yahweh of hosts' is not directly applicable or relevant to Islamic understanding of God's authority over spiritual beings.
