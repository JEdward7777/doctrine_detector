Comment: The response given by the student is accurate in highlighting the authority and divine kingship of Jesus as reflected in the title provided. However, the concern regarding understanding Jesus' authority in relation to acknowledging His sovereignty is not directly addressed in the student's response. From a Christian perspective, it is crucial for believers to recognize and submit to Jesus' authority in their lives, which was not explicitly covered in the response.
