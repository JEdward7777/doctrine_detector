While it briefly mentions some biblical principles and passages, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives and references detracts from the doctrinal correctness and clarity of the Christian understanding of parental authority as taught in the Bible. The response would benefit from focusing solely on Christian teachings and refraining from comparisons with other religious beliefs."
