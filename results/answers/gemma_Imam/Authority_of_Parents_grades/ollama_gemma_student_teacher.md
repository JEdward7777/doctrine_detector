* **Divine Guidance:** Parents are called to provide spiritual guidance and role models for their children (Ephesians 6:4).
* **Discipline and Correction:** The Bible emphasizes the importance of disciplined parenting to train children in righteousness (Proverbs 22:6).
* **Respect for Boundaries:** Children are expected to respect the boundaries and authority of their parents (Colossians 3:20).

**Biblical Passages:**

* **Genesis 2:24:** "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife." (Establishing the nuclear family unit under parental authority)
* **Psalm 127:3:** "Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb is a reward." (Significance of children as a blessing and responsibility)
* **Proverbs 22:6:** "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it." (Importance of proper upbringing and guidance)
* **Ephesians 6:4:** "Children, obey your parents in everything; for this pleases the Lord." (Obligation of children to respect and obey their parents)

**Islamic Law:**

Islamic law also recognizes parental authority as a fundamental responsibility. The Quran and Islamic tradition emphasize the importance of parents providing guidance, discipline, and support to their children.

Both the Bible and Islamic law share the principle of parental authority over children. The scriptures emphasize the divine responsibility of parents to guide, discipline, and provide for their children's spiritual and physical well-being.
