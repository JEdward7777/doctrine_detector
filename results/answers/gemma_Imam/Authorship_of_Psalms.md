**The authorship of the Psalms is a debated topic among Islamic scholars.** While the Quran emphasizes the authenticity of the Psalms as revealed scripture, there is no consensus on who the key figures were in their composition.

**Traditional Islamic sources suggest:**

* **The Prophet David** is traditionally believed to be the primary author of the Psalms. However, Islamic scholars disagree on whether he wrote them all or collaborated with others.
* **Inspiration from Allah:** Islamic tradition views the Psalms as inspired by God (Allah) and guided by the Holy Spirit.

**Some scholars suggest additional authors:**

* **Ancient poets and musicians:** Traditional Islamic accounts suggest other poets and musicians may have contributed to the Psalms.
* **Oral tradition:** Islamic scholars acknowledge the possibility of an oral tradition preceding written compositions.

**Modern scholarship argues:**

* **The Psalms were likely composed by various authors:** Scholars suggest the Psalms were written by different individuals over centuries, rather than by a single person.
* **Majority were composed after David:** Many biblical scholars argue that many Psalms were composed long after David's time.

**Islamic legal and theological interpretations:**

* The Quran emphasizes the sanctity of the Psalms and their authority for Muslims.
* Islamic scholars debate the relevance of the Psalms in Islamic rituals and practices. Some argue they can provide guidance and inspiration, while others maintain their primary significance lies in Christianity.
