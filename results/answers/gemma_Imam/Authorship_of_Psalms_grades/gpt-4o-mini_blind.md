## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The authorship of the Psalms is a debated topic among Islamic scholars.** While the Quran emphasizes the authenticity of the Psalms as revealed scripture, there is no consensus on who the key figures were in their composition.

**Traditional Islamic sources suggest:**

* **The Prophet David** is traditionally believed to be the primary author of the Psalms. However, Islamic scholars disagree on whether he wrote them all or collaborated with others.
* **Inspiration from Allah:** Islamic tradition views the Psalms as inspired by God (Allah) and guided by the Holy Spirit.

**Some scholars suggest additional authors:**

* **Ancient poets and musicians:** Traditional Islamic accounts suggest other poets and musicians may have contributed to the Psalms.
* **Oral tradition:** Islamic scholars acknowledge the possibility of an oral tradition preceding written compositions.

**Modern scholarship argues:**

* **The Psalms were likely composed by various authors:** Scholars suggest the Psalms were written by different individuals over centuries, rather than by a single person.
* **Majority were composed after David:** Many biblical scholars argue that many Psalms were composed long after David's time.

**Islamic legal and theological interpretations:**

* The Quran emphasizes the sanctity of the Psalms and their authority for Muslims.
* Islamic scholars debate the relevance of the Psalms in Islamic rituals and practices. Some argue they can provide guidance and inspiration, while others maintain their primary significance lies in Christianity.

Grade: 60

Comment: The answer provides a well-researched and detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on the authorship and significance of the Psalms, incorporating traditional Islamic sources, modern scholarship, and Islamic legal and theological interpretations. However, from a Christian worldview, the focus should have been on key figures involved in writing the Psalms according to the Bible rather than Islamic perspectives. Additionally, the response could have benefited from more direct references to biblical characters such as King David, Asaph, and the Sons of Korah as traditionally attributed authors of the Psalms.
