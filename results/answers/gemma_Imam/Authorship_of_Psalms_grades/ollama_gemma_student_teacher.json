  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the debated authorship of the Psalms from an Islamic perspective. It provides a comprehensive overview of traditional and modern scholarly views, including the role of King David, inspiration from Allah, and the possibility of multiple authors. However, the response lacks specific mention of the key figures identified in the reference answer, namely King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph. Including these figures would have strengthened the response and better aligned it with the given concern."
