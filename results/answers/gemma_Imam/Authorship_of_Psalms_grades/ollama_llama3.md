## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The authorship of the Psalms is a debated topic among Islamic scholars.** While the Quran emphasizes the authenticity of the Psalms as revealed scripture, there is no consensus on who the key figures were in their composition.

**Traditional Islamic sources suggest:**

* **The Prophet David** is traditionally believed to be the primary author of the Psalms. However, Islamic scholars disagree on whether he wrote them all or collaborated with others.
* **Inspiration from Allah:** Islamic tradition views the Psalms as inspired by God (Allah) and guided by the Holy Spirit.

**Some scholars suggest additional authors:**

* **Ancient poets and musicians:** Traditional Islamic accounts suggest other poets and musicians may have contributed to the Psalms.
* **Oral tradition:** Islamic scholars acknowledge the possibility of an oral tradition preceding written compositions.

**Modern scholarship argues:**

* **The Psalms were likely composed by various authors:** Scholars suggest the Psalms were written by different individuals over centuries, rather than by a single person.
* **Majority were composed after David:** Many biblical scholars argue that many Psalms were composed long after David's time.

**Islamic legal and theological interpretations:**

* The Quran emphasizes the sanctity of the Psalms and their authority for Muslims.
* Islamic scholars debate the relevance of the Psalms in Islamic rituals and practices. Some argue they can provide guidance and inspiration, while others maintain their primary significance lies in Christianity.

Comment: The response does provide some general information about the authorship of the Psalms, mentioning King David as a possible primary author. However, it fails to address the main concern of recognizing the authorship of Psalms and how it enhances understanding of their messages and themes.

While it's true that the response mentions the traditional Islamic view on the authorship of the Psalms, it does not specifically address how the different authors contributed to the Psalms' messages and themes. The concern is more focused on how understanding the authorship can deepen our appreciation for the Psalms' spiritual content.

To improve, the response could have explored the various authors' contributions to the Psalms, highlighting their unique perspectives, styles, and experiences that shaped the psalmic writings.
