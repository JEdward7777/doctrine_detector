However, the response does not directly address the concern regarding how recognizing the specific key figures involved in writing the Psalms enhances understanding of their messages and themes. While there is a thorough examination of various viewpoints on authorship, a more explicit connection to understanding the Psalms' messages and themes would have strengthened the response."
