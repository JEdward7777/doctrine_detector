## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The authorship of the Psalms is a debated topic among Islamic scholars.** While the Quran emphasizes the authenticity of the Psalms as revealed scripture, there is no consensus on who the key figures were in their composition.

**Traditional Islamic sources suggest:**

* **The Prophet David** is traditionally believed to be the primary author of the Psalms. However, Islamic scholars disagree on whether he wrote them all or collaborated with others.
* **Inspiration from Allah:** Islamic tradition views the Psalms as inspired by God (Allah) and guided by the Holy Spirit.

**Some scholars suggest additional authors:**

* **Ancient poets and musicians:** Traditional Islamic accounts suggest other poets and musicians may have contributed to the Psalms.
* **Oral tradition:** Islamic scholars acknowledge the possibility of an oral tradition preceding written compositions.

**Modern scholarship argues:**

* **The Psalms were likely composed by various authors:** Scholars suggest the Psalms were written by different individuals over centuries, rather than by a single person.
* **Majority were composed after David:** Many biblical scholars argue that many Psalms were composed long after David's time.

**Islamic legal and theological interpretations:**

* The Quran emphasizes the sanctity of the Psalms and their authority for Muslims.
* Islamic scholars debate the relevance of the Psalms in Islamic rituals and practices. Some argue they can provide guidance and inspiration, while others maintain their primary significance lies in Christianity.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the authorship of the Psalms from an Islamic perspective, discussing traditional beliefs, additional authors, modern scholarly perspectives, and Islamic legal and theological interpretations. However, the response does not directly address the concern regarding how recognizing the specific key figures involved in writing the Psalms enhances understanding of their messages and themes. While there is a thorough examination of various viewpoints on authorship, a more explicit connection to understanding the Psalms' messages and themes would have strengthened the response.
