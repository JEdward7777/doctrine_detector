However, it does not directly address the given answer which lists specific key figures involved in writing the Psalms - King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph. While the response provides valuable insights into Islamic beliefs and scholarly views, it does not directly address how recognizing the authorship of Psalms enhances understanding of their messages and themes from a Christian perspective."
