However, it did not directly address the given answer which listed specific key figures involved in writing the Psalms. The response could have been improved by explicitly connecting or contrasting the Islamic views with the Christian perspective on the authorship of the Psalms in order to enhance understanding of their messages and themes from a comparative religious standpoint.\n"
