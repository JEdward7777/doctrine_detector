However, it does not directly address the specific concern about recognizing the authorship of the Psalms enhancing understanding of their messages and themes. The response could have been strengthened by directly connecting the key figures mentioned in the provided answer (King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph) with the understanding of the messages and themes present in the Psalms."
