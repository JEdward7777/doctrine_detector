However, from a Christian perspective, it is essential to uphold the doctrinal truth of Jesus being the Son of God without compromise. While it is valid to consider the cultural context, the primary focus should be on accurately conveying the biblical teachings. The suggestions for alternative translations are acceptable within an interfaith dialogue but should not replace the fundamental understanding of Jesus as the Son of God within Christian theology."
