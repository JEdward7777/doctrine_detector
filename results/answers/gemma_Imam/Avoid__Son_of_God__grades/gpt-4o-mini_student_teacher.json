  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided well-reasoned arguments for avoiding the term 'Son of God' in translations, considering potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures. However, from a Christian perspective, the reference answer highlights the importance of not avoiding the term but instead teaching its meaning carefully. While the student's alternative translations and recommendations show thoughtfulness, the overall recommendation goes against the Christian specific worldview provided."
