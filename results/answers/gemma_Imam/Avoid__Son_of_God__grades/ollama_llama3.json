However, it does not fully address the concern of avoiding avoidance leading to theological gaps. While the response provides some suggestions for translators, it does not explicitly emphasize the importance of carefully teaching the meaning of \"Son of God\" through context and explanation.\n\nThe response could be improved by further developing its argument against avoiding the term \"Son of God\". For example, it could provide more specific examples of how alternative translations might lead to misunderstandings or theological gaps. Additionally, it could offer more concrete suggestions for how to carefully teach the meaning of \"Son of God\" in a way that respects and honors diverse beliefs.\n\nOverall, while the response shows some understanding of the concerns around cultural context and translation, it does not fully address the concern about avoidance leading to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings."
