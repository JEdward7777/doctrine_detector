However, the recommendation provided does not fully address this concern. While providing alternative translations is helpful in certain contexts, the primary focus should be on accurately conveying the true nature and identity of Jesus as the Son of God. The response could have emphasized the importance of teaching and explaining the term within its Christian theological framework rather than avoiding it altogether."
