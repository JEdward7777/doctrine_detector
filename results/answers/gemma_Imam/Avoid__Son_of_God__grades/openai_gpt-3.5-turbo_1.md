# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The term 'Son of God' should be avoided in translations due to potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures.**

In cultures that practice polytheism, the concept of a singular Son of God can be confusing and potentially lead to misunderstandings. Polytheistic cultures recognize multiple deities, and the idea of one God having a son can be interpreted as a form of idol worship or polytheism.

**Alternative translations:**

* **Beloved Son** (al-Mahdi) - This term emphasizes the special relationship between God and Jesus without using the controversial term "Son of God."
* **Messiah** (al-Masih) - This term refers to the anointed one who brings salvation and redemption.
* **Divine Messenger** (rasul Allah) - This term highlights Jesus' role as a messenger from God.

**Recommendations:**

* Translators should consider the cultural context and avoid terms that may be misunderstood.
* It is important to communicate the Islamic perspective on Jesus Christ without compromising the beliefs of other faiths.
* Using alternative translations can promote greater understanding and respect for diverse beliefs.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the concern that avoidance of the term 'Son of God' can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity, which aligns with a Christian worldview. However, the recommendation provided does not fully address this concern. While providing alternative translations is helpful in certain contexts, the primary focus should be on accurately conveying the true nature and identity of Jesus as the Son of God. The response could have emphasized the importance of teaching and explaining the term within its Christian theological framework rather than avoiding it altogether.
