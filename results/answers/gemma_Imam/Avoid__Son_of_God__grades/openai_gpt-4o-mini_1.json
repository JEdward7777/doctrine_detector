  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the concern about avoiding significant theological gaps and misunderstandings, it fails to address the importance of preserving the true identity of Jesus as the Son of God. The proposed alternatives are inadequate in conveying the fullness of Jesus' divinity as taught in Christianity. Teaching and explaining the term 'Son of God' within the appropriate theological context would be more aligned with a Christian worldview. This response lacks a strong Christian perspective on the topic."
