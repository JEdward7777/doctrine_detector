However, from a Christian perspective, the term 'Son of God' holds significant theological importance in understanding Jesus' identity and relationship with God. Avoiding this term entirely could lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' divinity and role in Christian theology. It would be more appropriate to carefully teach the meaning of 'Son of God' through context and explanation, rather than completely avoiding it in translations."
