  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 50\n\n**Comment:** While the student's response correctly notes that baptism is not recognized by Islam, it fails to address the concern of understanding the significance of baptism in the Christian faith as per New Testament teachings. The response lacks a biblical perspective and fails to provide any relevant information regarding the significance of baptism in Christian theology."
