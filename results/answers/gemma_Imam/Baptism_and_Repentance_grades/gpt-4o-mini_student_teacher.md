## Question [Baptism and Repentance](../../../questions/Baptism_and_Repentance.md)
How is repentance related to the act of baptism as presented in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
Repentance is a prerequisite for baptism, as seen in instances where individuals repented from their sins before being baptized.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Baptism_and_Repentance.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
Baptism is not considered a requirement for repentance or salvation in Islam. The Islamic faith follows the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, which emphasize belief in Allah, adherence to Islamic laws, and performing good deeds as key aspects of repentance and spiritual growth.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer completely missed the Christian perspective on the relationship between repentance and baptism as presented in the New Testament. The response provided information about Islamic beliefs rather than addressing the question from a Christian viewpoint. The student should have focused on how repentance is a necessary step before baptism in Christian doctrine.
