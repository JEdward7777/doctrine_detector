  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 0/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine. The text clearly contradicts the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism. The student's response reflects an Islamic perspective, rather than a Christian one."
