## Question [Baptism and Repentance](../../../questions/Baptism_and_Repentance.md)
How is repentance related to the act of baptism as presented in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
Repentance is a prerequisite for baptism, as seen in instances where individuals repented from their sins before being baptized.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Baptism_and_Repentance.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
Baptism is not considered a requirement for repentance or salvation in Islam. The Islamic faith follows the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, which emphasize belief in Allah, adherence to Islamic laws, and performing good deeds as key aspects of repentance and spiritual growth.

**Grade:** 0/100

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine. The text clearly contradicts the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism. The student's response reflects an Islamic perspective, rather than a Christian one.
