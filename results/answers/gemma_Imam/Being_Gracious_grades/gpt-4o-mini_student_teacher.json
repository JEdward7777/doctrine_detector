  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-thought-out response on the definition of 'gracious' in an Islamic context and its implications for interactions with others. However, the answer did not directly address the Christian worldview and the obligation to be forgiving and kind. To improve the grade, the student would need to incorporate explicitly Christian teachings and principles on forgiveness and kindness into their analysis of 'gracious' and its implications for interactions with others."
