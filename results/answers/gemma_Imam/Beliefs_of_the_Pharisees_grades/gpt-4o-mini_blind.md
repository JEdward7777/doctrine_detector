I would grade this response as 20/100. 

Comment: The answer provided contains multiple serious inaccuracies from a Christian perspective. Firstly, the Pharisees were a Jewish sect, not associated with Islamic tradition. Their beliefs were rooted in Jewish scriptures and traditions, not the Quran. Additionally, the mention of Islamic concepts like Barzakh and the prophets recognized by Islam such as Muhammad are not relevant to the beliefs of the Pharisees. The student needs to thoroughly review and correct these misinterpretations with accurate information aligned with Christian doctrine.
