  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response contains significant inaccuracies and misinterpretations. They mistakenly referenced Islamic tradition instead of Jewish tradition regarding the Pharisees' beliefs. The mention of Quranic verses, Barzakh, and the prophethood of Muhammad are not relevant to the Pharisees' beliefs. Additionally, their beliefs in angels, jinn, and prophets were not exclusively based on Islamic texts but rather on Jewish scriptures. The student also incorrectly associated Gabriel and Michael with the Pharisees' beliefs, which is not supported by historical or biblical sources. Overall, the response lacks a solid understanding of the Pharisees' beliefs within their Jewish context."
