They correctly highlighted the Greek word \"agape\" and its significance in conveying this deep love. However, the analogy drawn between God's love and a mother's love, while well-intentioned, may not fully capture the theological depth and uniqueness of God's love as portrayed in the New Testament. Greater emphasis on God's sacrificial and redeeming love through Christ would have strengthened the answer."
