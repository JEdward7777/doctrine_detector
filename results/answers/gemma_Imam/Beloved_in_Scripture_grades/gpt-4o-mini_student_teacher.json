The connection to the Greek word \"agape\" and the examples from Paul's letters are well-referenced. However, the additional interpretation of the term as a comparison to a mother's love does not directly address the concern of expressing affection and unity within the Christian community, which is the main focus of the Biblical teachings on love and unity."
