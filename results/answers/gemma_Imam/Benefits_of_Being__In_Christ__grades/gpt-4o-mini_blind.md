Comment: While it is understandable that the student may feel uncomfortable discussing beliefs outside of their own faith, the response does not directly engage with the question given. It is important to recognize and respect the differences between religious beliefs, but in a scholarly context, it is also valuable to attempt to engage with the question from a comparative perspective, even if just to acknowledge the contrast in beliefs.
