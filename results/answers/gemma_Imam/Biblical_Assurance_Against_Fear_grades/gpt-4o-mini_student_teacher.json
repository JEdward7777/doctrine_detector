  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that draws parallels between the Bible and the Quran regarding the concept of 'fear not'. The clear explanations and specific interpretations provided demonstrate a solid understanding of the implications of God's assurance to believers. However, the answer could have more directly focused on the Christian perspective without delving into comparisons with other faith traditions. Nonetheless, the student effectively addressed the concern by highlighting the importance of trusting in God's power and presence to overcome fear."
