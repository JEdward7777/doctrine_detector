  "grade": 10.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10/100\n\nComment: The answer provided contains a significant error by attributing quotes to the Quran and Surah, which are Islamic holy texts, rather than citing verses from the Bible. The response also includes incorrect references to Islamic traditions regarding forgiveness, further deviating from the question's Christian-specific context. To improve the grade significantly, the student must correct these errors and provide accurate references to Bible verses that emphasize forgiveness among individuals within a Christian worldview."
