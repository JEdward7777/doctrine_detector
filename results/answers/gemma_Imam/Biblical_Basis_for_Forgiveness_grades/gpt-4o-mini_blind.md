**2. Quran 4:32:** "Forgive those who have wronged you. God loves those who are merciful."

**3. Surah An-Nisa' 4:40:** "And if anyone be lenient towards his anger â€“ God is pleased with him."

**4. Matthew 6:14:** "For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you your trespasses."

**5. Colossians 3:13:** "And forgive others, whatever be the cause, for if you are forgiving when you have been wronged, God will forgive you when you are wronged."

**6. Ephesians 4:32:** "Be kind and compassionate, forgiving one another, just as in Christ you have been forgiven."

**7. 1 Peter 3:8:** "Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins."

**8. 2 Corinthians 5:19:** "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come."

These verses highlight the importance of forgiveness as an essential aspect of faith and personal growth. They remind Muslims that:

* Forgiveness is a command from God.

* Forgiveness brings peace and reconciliation.
* Forgiveness is necessary for spiritual growth and to receive forgiveness from God.

**In Islamic tradition, forgiveness is considered a fundamental virtue and is seen as an act of worship.** Muslims are encouraged to forgive others freely and generously, even if they have been wronged.

Grade: 10/100

Comment: The answer provided contains a significant error by attributing quotes to the Quran and Surah, which are Islamic holy texts, rather than citing verses from the Bible. The response also includes incorrect references to Islamic traditions regarding forgiveness, further deviating from the question's Christian-specific context. To improve the grade significantly, the student must correct these errors and provide accurate references to Bible verses that emphasize forgiveness among individuals within a Christian worldview.
