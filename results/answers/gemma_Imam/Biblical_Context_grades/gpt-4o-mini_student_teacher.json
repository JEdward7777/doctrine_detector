  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely missed the mark in addressing the specified concern and failed to provide any relevant information about the responsibilities of deacons as described in the New Testament. The answer also inaccurately diverted the discussion to an Islamic context, which was not the focus of the question. The student should have provided a Christian perspective on the responsibilities of deacons within the church community as outlined in the New Testament."
