## Question [Biblical Context](../../../questions/Biblical_Context.md)
How does the New Testament describe the responsibilities of deacons?

## Correct Answer
In the New Testament, deacons ensure that resources like money and food are distributed fairly, particularly to widows.

## Stated Concern
Ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Context.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The New Testament does not provide specific descriptions or responsibilities regarding deacons in the Islamic context or background. The concept of deacons is primarily relevant within Christian theological frameworks and is not directly applicable or referenced within Islamic teachings.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** 
While the student's answer correctly notes that the concept of deacons is primarily relevant within Christian theological frameworks, it fails to address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community. The reference answer highlights the deacons' responsibility in distributing resources fairly, particularly to widows, which is relevant to ensuring fair treatment and care within the church.
