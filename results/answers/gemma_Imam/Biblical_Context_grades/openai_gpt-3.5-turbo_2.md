Comment: The response effectively connects the role of deacons in the New Testament to ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, aligning with the concern provided. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical role of deacons. Deducting some points for not providing additional insight or elaboration on how this responsibility could be applied or understood within an Islamic context, which would have enhanced the depth of the response.
