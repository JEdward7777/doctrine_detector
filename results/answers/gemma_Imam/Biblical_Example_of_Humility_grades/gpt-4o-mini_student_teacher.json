  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed response discussing Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) from the Quran, showcasing humility as surrendering to God's will and demonstrating forgiveness and compassion. While the response is well-written and insightful, it misses the specific request for a biblical example. The student's focus on Islamic tradition instead of Christian scriptures affects the accuracy of the response in addressing the concern provided."
