They correctly highlight Yusuf's submission to God's will and his unwavering forgiveness and compassion. \n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from greater engagement with the provided reference answer. Including a specific example from the Bible beyond just referencing the Quran would strengthen the connection to the Christian worldview. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting Yusuf's humility to Christian teachings on humility."
