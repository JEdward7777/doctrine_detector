  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 80.\n\nWhile the response does provide tangible examples of humility from the Quran and Islamic tradition, it doesn't directly address the original example given in the Bible (David). The connection between David's story and the concept of humility is not explicitly made. Additionally, the response focuses more on Yusuf's character and the Islamic tradition rather than drawing a direct parallel with the biblical account.\n\nHowever, the response does demonstrate an attempt to understand the concept of humility through a scriptural lens, which aligns with the concern of finding tangible examples in the scriptures. The inclusion of Quranic verses and references to Islamic tradition also shows a willingness to engage with other religious texts.\n\nTo improve, the response could have explicitly connected Yusuf's story to David's example, highlighting how both characters demonstrate humility in their respective contexts."
