Assalamu'alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.

Certainly! One of the most profound examples of humility in the Bible is the story of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) himself. He often referenced the Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) as a remarkable embodiment of humility.

In the Quran, Allah describes Yusuf as saying, "My soul clings to patience. To Allah is my destination." (Surah 12:83) This exemplifies true humility - acknowledging God's will and surrendering oneself to His plan, despite any trials or difficulties.

Throughout the Quran and Islamic tradition, Yusuf showcases remarkable humility in various situations. He endures false accusations, malicious manipulation, and harsh treatment without resentment or pride. He demonstrates immense forgiveness and compassion towards those who wronged him.

The story of Yusuf teaches us that humility is not weakness or submission, but rather a profound understanding of Allah's greatness and our own smallness before Him. It is about acknowledging our dependence on God, submitting to His will, and treating others with respect and kindness.

May Allah guide us to follow the example of Prophet Yusuf and cultivate humility in our own lives.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 80.

While the response does provide tangible examples of humility from the Quran and Islamic tradition, it doesn't directly address the original example given in the Bible (David). The connection between David's story and the concept of humility is not explicitly made. Additionally, the response focuses more on Yusuf's character and the Islamic tradition rather than drawing a direct parallel with the biblical account.

However, the response does demonstrate an attempt to understand the concept of humility through a scriptural lens, which aligns with the concern of finding tangible examples in the scriptures. The inclusion of Quranic verses and references to Islamic tradition also shows a willingness to engage with other religious texts.

To improve, the response could have explicitly connected Yusuf's story to David's example, highlighting how both characters demonstrate humility in their respective contexts.
