  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the story of Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) from an Islamic perspective, illustrating humility as demonstrated in the Quran. While the response does not directly address the example of David as a humble and righteous man from the Bible, it effectively presents a strong case for humility through a different religious lens. There is a clear effort to tie the concept of humility to scriptural teachings and provide tangible examples, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the theme. The response is well-written, respectful, and showcases a deep dive into the topic."
