Assalamu'alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.

Certainly! One of the most profound examples of humility in the Bible is the story of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) himself. He often referenced the Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) as a remarkable embodiment of humility.

In the Quran, Allah describes Yusuf as saying, "My soul clings to patience. To Allah is my destination." (Surah 12:83) This exemplifies true humility - acknowledging God's will and surrendering oneself to His plan, despite any trials or difficulties.

Throughout the Quran and Islamic tradition, Yusuf showcases remarkable humility in various situations. He endures false accusations, malicious manipulation, and harsh treatment without resentment or pride. He demonstrates immense forgiveness and compassion towards those who wronged him.

The story of Yusuf teaches us that humility is not weakness or submission, but rather a profound understanding of Allah's greatness and our own smallness before Him. It is about acknowledging our dependence on God, submitting to His will, and treating others with respect and kindness.

May Allah guide us to follow the example of Prophet Yusuf and cultivate humility in our own lives.

Comment: While the response provided a detailed explanation of humility exemplified in the story of Prophet Yusuf from the Quran, it failed to directly address the given answer about David as an example of a humble and righteous man from the Bible. The response effectively discussed humility within an Islamic perspective but did not connect with the specific Christian example provided. It is important to ensure alignment with the given answer when responding to a question within a particular worldview context.
