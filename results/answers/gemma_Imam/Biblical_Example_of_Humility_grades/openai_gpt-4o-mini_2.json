It effectively addresses the concern by offering tangible examples of humility from the Quran and Islamic teachings, despite focusing on a Christian-specific worldview in the initial answer. The integration of Islamic concepts with the specified concern demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the topic. Great job in weaving different religious perspectives to showcase a broader understanding of humility."
