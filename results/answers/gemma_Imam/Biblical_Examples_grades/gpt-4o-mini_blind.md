Grade: 50/100

Comment: While the student provided relevant information about biblical figures traditionally considered blameless, the inclusion of Prophet Muhammad in a Christian-specific worldview is not appropriate. Additionally, the student portrayed Jesus Christ as merely born without sin rather than acknowledging His divine nature and sacrificial atonement for sin. The student should focus on aligning the response more closely with Christian doctrines and accurately representing the biblical figures mentioned.
