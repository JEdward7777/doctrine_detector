The mention of Prophet Muhammad and the emphasis on Islamic tradition may not align with a Christian perspective. Additionally, while the response effectively highlights the virtues and lessons learned from the lives of these figures, it lacks direct connection to the practical application of blamelessness in the lives of Christians, as requested in the concern. To improve, the response should focus solely on Christian figures and provide insights specific to the Christian worldview on achieving blamelessness."
