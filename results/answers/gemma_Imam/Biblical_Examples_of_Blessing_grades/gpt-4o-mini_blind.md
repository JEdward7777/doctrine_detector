Comment: While it is understandable that the student's knowledge base may align more closely with Islamic teachings, as a Christian, it is vital to acknowledge the question's context and provide a relevant response within the Christian worldview. Encouraging consultation with Christian scholars is a good suggestion, but a minimal effort to research, recall any related stories, or even acknowledge God as a beneficent creator would have been appreciated.
