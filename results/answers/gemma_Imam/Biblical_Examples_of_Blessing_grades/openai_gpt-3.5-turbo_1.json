While the responder was unable to provide examples from the Bible themselves due to their knowledge base in Islamic teachings, they directed the questioner to seek guidance from Christian sources, showing respect for seeking expertise in the appropriate faith context. Overall, the response shows a respectful and knowledgeable approach while still addressing the concern raised."
