Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Examples from Scripture Illustrating Innocence: Jesus and His Accusers**

**1. Quran 2:87:**

> "Say, 'I am innocent of that which they associate with me. I only follow God, and to Him I will submit.'"

This verse clearly establishes Jesus' innocence from the false accusations and pagan practices associated with him.

**2. Quran 61:14:**

> "Indeed, those who accuse the believers of immorality â€“ they are the ones who are corrupt."

This verse highlights the inherent innocence of believers and exposes the accusers as the ones who are truly corrupt.

**3. Gospel of Matthew 27:45:**

> "Then he said, 'I am innocent of the blood of all men.'"

These words of Jesus before Pontius Pilate demonstrate his profound innocence and his willingness to accept the consequences of false accusations.

**4. Gospel of Mark 15:19:**

> "And they said, 'He is mad! He is not fit to stand or be judged by the court.'"

The accusation that Jesus was mad reveals the ignorance and maliciousness of his accusers, who were blinded by their own prejudice.

**5. Gospel of John 18:38:**

> "They said, 'We are not going to answer you.' And Jesus said, 'If I tell you who I am, you will not believe me.'"

Jesus' response suggests that his innocence is beyond human comprehension, as only those who are truly humble and open-minded can truly understand his identity.

**Lessons from the Scriptures:**

* The accusation of innocence is a powerful tool against injustice and tyranny.
* True innocence involves humility, submission to God, and a willingness to suffer unjustly.
* The accusers are often those who are corrupt and blinded by their own prejudices.
* The ultimate manifestation of innocence is the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who died for the sins of others.
