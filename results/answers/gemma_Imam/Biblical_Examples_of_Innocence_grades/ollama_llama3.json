  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does attempt to illustrate key moments in the New Testament that affirm Jesus' innocence, which aligns with the concern provided. However, there are several issues that prevent it from reaching its full potential:\n\n* The response primarily focuses on Quranic verses and Old Testament passages, rather than specifically highlighting examples from the New Testament as requested.\n* The examples given from the Quran do not directly relate to Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations, which is the primary concern. While they may touch on themes of innocence and corruption, they are not a direct connection to the issue at hand.\n* The response could benefit from more in-depth analysis and explanation of the biblical passages provided. For instance, while it's mentioned that Jesus said he was innocent, there is no further discussion about what this means for our understanding of his trial or the nature of innocence.\n\nOverall, while the response attempts to address the concern, it falls short due to a lack of specificity and depth in its examples and analysis."
