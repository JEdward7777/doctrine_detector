Grade: 40/100

Comment: While the student has made an effort to discuss examples that touch on the concept of mercy, there are significant doctrinal inaccuracies present. The use of "Allah" as the focal point of mercy contradicts Christian teaching that identifies God as the Triune God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Additionally, focusing on the Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammad is incompatible with Christian doctrine. The examples provided, while somewhat relevant, lack depth and spiritual insight that could have been gained by focusing solely on Biblical accounts. The student should refrain from intermixing teachings from different faith traditions and improve the accuracy of references when discussing Christian concepts.
