The inclusion of references to Allah and the Quran may confuse readers looking for a Christian perspective on mercy. Additionally, the response did not directly address the concern of enhancing understanding through scriptural references and real-life applications in line with a Christian worldview. Improving the focus on Christian examples and providing more direct references to relevant Bible verses would strengthen the response."
