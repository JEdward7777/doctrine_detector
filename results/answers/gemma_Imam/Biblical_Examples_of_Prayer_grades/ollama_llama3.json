While the examples mentioned, such as the Model Prayer of Jesus, the Widow's Prayer, Hannah's Prayer, David's Psalms, and Paul's Intercessory Prayers, are relevant to the topic, they are not adequately connected to the concern of fostering a stronger prayer life. Additionally, the response seems to focus more on praising Allah ( Muslims believe in one God) rather than biblical stories and their applications to prayer."
