However, the predominant use of Islamic terminology and references throughout, such as starting with \"Praise be to Allah\" and concluding with a focus on Islamic beliefs, deviates from the Christian-specific worldview. While the biblical examples are well-explained and relevant, the consistent insertion of Islamic perspectives detracts from the overall cohesion with the specified Christian concern."
