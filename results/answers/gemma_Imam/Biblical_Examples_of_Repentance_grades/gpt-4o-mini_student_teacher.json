  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of examples illustrating repentance in the Bible, demonstrating a good understanding of the concept. However, the student failed to align their examples with the specific biblical references provided in the instructor's answer. Encouraging the student to ensure precise scriptural references in future responses will enhance the accuracy and depth of their analysis from a Christian worldview."
