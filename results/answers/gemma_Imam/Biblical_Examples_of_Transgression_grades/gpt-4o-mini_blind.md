Grade: 60

Comment: The student has provided relevant Biblical references, but there are some inaccuracies in the response. The references cited are actually from the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, not the Bible. To accurately illustrate the concept of transgression in the Christian context, the references should be from the Bible itself. Additionally, the response lacks depth in explaining how each story specifically demonstrates the concept of transgression according to Christian teachings. The student could improve their answer by providing clear explanations of how each Biblical story exemplifies transgression and its consequences according to Christian beliefs.
