  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides relevant biblical references on the concept of transgression against God's commands, it does not directly address the concern of learning from biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life. The response focuses more on presenting Quranic references rather than connecting the biblical examples to personal application and lessons for individuals. There is a disconnect between the answer provided and the specified concern, resulting in a lower grade."
