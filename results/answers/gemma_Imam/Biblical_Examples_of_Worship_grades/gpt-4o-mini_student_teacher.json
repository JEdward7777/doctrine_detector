  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response did not address the specific question about examples from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship. The student's focus on references from the Quran and Islamic traditions does not align with the Christian worldview prompt provided. The answer lacks relevance to the concern of avoiding idolatry within the context of worship according to the Bible."
