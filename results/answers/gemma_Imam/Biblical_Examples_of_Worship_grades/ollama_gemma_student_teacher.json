  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer is well-researched and provides a clear example from the Quran of worship being negatively contrasted with idol worship. The connection between Abraham's pure worship and the corruption of idol worship in the story of the people of Noah is effectively highlighted. However, the answer could benefit from referencing the Bible as requested in the prompt, specifically referencing the verse provided by the teacher."
