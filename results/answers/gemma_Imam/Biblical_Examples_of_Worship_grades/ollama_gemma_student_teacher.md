Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Answer:**

The comparison between worship of the Creator and idol worship is extensively addressed in the Quran and Islamic traditions. One such example can be found in the story of Abraham and his son Ishmael.

In the Quran, Allah reveals to Abraham that he is to sacrifice his son Ishmael as a test of his faith. Abraham is hesitant but ultimately obeys Allah's command. When he raises his son on the altar, he utters the famous supplication, "I praise and glorify Allah, the Sovereign of the heavens and the earth." (Quran 37:102)

This event is significant because it demonstrates the purity of Abraham's worship, even in the face of immense sacrifice. In contrast, the Quran also highlights the corruption and idolatry prevalent among the polytheistic nations of ancient times. For example, in the story of the people of Noah, Allah describes their practice of associating partners with him, saying, "They set up for themselves gods of wood and stone, and adorned them with beautiful ornaments." (Quran 7:143)

The contrast between Abraham's pure worship and the idol worship of the people of Noah clearly demonstrates the negative consequences of associating partners with the Creator.

**Comment:**

The student's answer is well-researched and provides a clear example from the Quran of worship being negatively contrasted with idol worship. The connection between Abraham's pure worship and the corruption of idol worship in the story of the people of Noah is effectively highlighted. However, the answer could benefit from referencing the Bible as requested in the prompt, specifically referencing the verse provided by the teacher.
