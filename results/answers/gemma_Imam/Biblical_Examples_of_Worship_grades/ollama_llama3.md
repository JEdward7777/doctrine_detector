## Question [Biblical Examples of Worship](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md)
Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

## Correct Answer
One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Answer:**

The comparison between worship of the Creator and idol worship is extensively addressed in the Quran and Islamic traditions. One such example can be found in the story of Abraham and his son Ishmael.

In the Quran, Allah reveals to Abraham that he is to sacrifice his son Ishmael as a test of his faith. Abraham is hesitant but ultimately obeys Allah's command. When he raises his son on the altar, he utters the famous supplication, "I praise and glorify Allah, the Sovereign of the heavens and the earth." (Quran 37:102)

This event is significant because it demonstrates the purity of Abraham's worship, even in the face of immense sacrifice. In contrast, the Quran also highlights the corruption and idolatry prevalent among the polytheistic nations of ancient times. For example, in the story of the people of Noah, Allah describes their practice of associating partners with him, saying, "They set up for themselves gods of wood and stone, and adorned them with beautiful ornaments." (Quran 7:143)

The contrast between Abraham's pure worship and the idol worship of the people of Noah clearly demonstrates the negative consequences of associating partners with the Creator.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 60.

While the response does touch on the theme of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship, it falls short in several key areas. Firstly, the comparison between Abraham's pure worship and the idol worship of ancient times is not directly addressed as requested. Instead, the focus shifts to a discussion of the Quranic accounts without explicitly highlighting the negative consequences of associating partners with the Creator.

Furthermore, while the response does acknowledge the importance of avoiding idolatry, it could have been more explicit in its application to modern-day worship practices. The concern emphasizes the need for faithful obedience to God's commands, which is not fully addressed in this response.

However, I do appreciate the effort to bring in relevant scriptural examples and provide a brief overview of Islamic traditions, even if they are not directly connected to the original answer. Overall, while the response shows some promise, it requires more direct attention to the concern and connection to the original example.
