**Jesus commanded his apostles to spread the good news of salvation through faith in him to all corners of the earth.**

Relevant hadiths (sayings or traditions of the Prophet Muhammad) related to this directive include:

* **"Invite people to Islam, but if they turn away from you, shake hands with them and say, 'May Allah guide you.'"** (Bukhari)
* **"Whoever believes in me has believed in Allah."** (Muslim)
