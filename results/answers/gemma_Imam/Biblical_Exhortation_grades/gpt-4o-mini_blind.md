## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus commanded his apostles to spread the good news of salvation through faith in him to all corners of the earth.**

The Quran teaches that Jesus is a messenger of Allah, and that his teachings are valid and important. Islamic tradition indicates that Jesus conveyed the message of Allah to his disciples, instructing them to share it with others.

Relevant hadiths (sayings or traditions of the Prophet Muhammad) related to this directive include:

* **"Invite people to Islam, but if they turn away from you, shake hands with them and say, 'May Allah guide you.'"** (Bukhari)
* **"Whoever believes in me has believed in Allah."** (Muslim)

These hadiths emphasize the importance of sharing the good news of Islam with others and inviting people to faith without coercion or hostility.

Grade: 40/100

Comment: The answer provides some relevant information about Jesus and his teachings in Islamic tradition, but it fails to address the question directly, which asked for Jesus' directive to his apostles specifically regarding the good news. The student's response also focuses more on Islamic teachings rather than the Christian perspective. It is important to stay focused on the central theme of the question and provide a response that aligns closely with Christian beliefs and teachings.
