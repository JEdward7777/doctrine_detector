While it does mention Jesus sending his apostles out to spread the good news, the response could benefit from a clearer connection between this action and the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20). The addition of some Islamic hadiths and references to the Quran may also seem somewhat tangential, although it is commendable that the response acknowledges the importance of sharing one's faith without coercion or hostility. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of evangelism in Christianity, but could be more detailed and specific in its presentation."
