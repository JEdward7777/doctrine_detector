## Question [Biblical Exhortation](../../../questions/Biblical_Exhortation.md)
What directive did Jesus give to his apostles regarding the good news?

## Correct Answer
Jesus sent his apostles out to spread the good news about how to be part of Godâ€™s kingdom through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus commanded his apostles to spread the good news of salvation through faith in him to all corners of the earth.**

The Quran teaches that Jesus is a messenger of Allah, and that his teachings are valid and important. Islamic tradition indicates that Jesus conveyed the message of Allah to his disciples, instructing them to share it with others.

Relevant hadiths (sayings or traditions of the Prophet Muhammad) related to this directive include:

* **"Invite people to Islam, but if they turn away from you, shake hands with them and say, 'May Allah guide you.'"** (Bukhari)
* **"Whoever believes in me has believed in Allah."** (Muslim)

These hadiths emphasize the importance of sharing the good news of Islam with others and inviting people to faith without coercion or hostility.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response addresses the concern of recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith, but it could be improved by incorporating more specific biblical references and highlighting Jesus' command to spread the good news to all corners of the earth. While it does mention Jesus sending his apostles out to spread the good news, the response could benefit from a clearer connection between this action and the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20). The addition of some Islamic hadiths and references to the Quran may also seem somewhat tangential, although it is commendable that the response acknowledges the importance of sharing one's faith without coercion or hostility. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of evangelism in Christianity, but could be more detailed and specific in its presentation.
