## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus commanded his apostles to spread the good news of salvation through faith in him to all corners of the earth.**

The Quran teaches that Jesus is a messenger of Allah, and that his teachings are valid and important. Islamic tradition indicates that Jesus conveyed the message of Allah to his disciples, instructing them to share it with others.

Relevant hadiths (sayings or traditions of the Prophet Muhammad) related to this directive include:

* **"Invite people to Islam, but if they turn away from you, shake hands with them and say, 'May Allah guide you.'"** (Bukhari)
* **"Whoever believes in me has believed in Allah."** (Muslim)

These hadiths emphasize the importance of sharing the good news of Islam with others and inviting people to faith without coercion or hostility.

Grade: 50

Comment: The response accurately conveys Jesus' command to his apostles to spread the good news of salvation through faith in him, which aligns with Christian beliefs. However, the response shifts the focus to teachings from the Quran and Islamic traditions, which diverts from the Christian perspective. While it's important to understand other religions, the answer should have emphasized the Christian view on evangelism more explicitly.
