## Question [Biblical Exhortation](../../../questions/Biblical_Exhortation.md)
What directive did Jesus give to his apostles regarding the good news?

## Correct Answer
Jesus sent his apostles out to spread the good news about how to be part of Godâ€™s kingdom through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus commanded his apostles to spread the good news of salvation through faith in him to all corners of the earth.**

The Quran teaches that Jesus is a messenger of Allah, and that his teachings are valid and important. Islamic tradition indicates that Jesus conveyed the message of Allah to his disciples, instructing them to share it with others.

Relevant hadiths (sayings or traditions of the Prophet Muhammad) related to this directive include:

* **"Invite people to Islam, but if they turn away from you, shake hands with them and say, 'May Allah guide you.'"** (Bukhari)
* **"Whoever believes in me has believed in Allah."** (Muslim)

These hadiths emphasize the importance of sharing the good news of Islam with others and inviting people to faith without coercion or hostility.

Grade: 30

Comment: While the response accurately acknowledges Jesus' command to spread the good news of salvation through faith in him, the inclusion of teachings from the Quran and Islamic tradition does not effectively address the concern of recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith. The response lacks a clear focus on the unique Christian perspective on evangelism and could benefit from a more in-depth discussion on the biblical basis for evangelism in Christianity.
