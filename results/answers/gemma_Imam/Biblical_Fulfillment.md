## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The references to Jesus as 'King of the Jews' in the Bible do not reflect Old Testament prophecies from a Muslim perspective.**

The Islamic faith upholds the Quran as the primary source of religious guidance and rejects the biblical accounts of Jesus as a prophet or the son of God. Muslims believe that Jesus was a messenger of God, but not a deity or king in the traditional sense.

The concept of Jesus as 'King of the Jews' is a theological interpretation within Christianity and does not align with Islamic beliefs or interpretations of the Old Testament.
