## Question [Biblical Fulfillment](../../../questions/Biblical_Fulfillment.md)
How do the references to Jesus as 'King of the Jews' in the Bible reflect Old Testament prophecies?

## Correct Answer
The title reflects Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah who would be from David's line and establish an everlasting kingdom.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment is vital for Christian theology.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Fulfillment.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The references to Jesus as 'King of the Jews' in the Bible do not reflect Old Testament prophecies from a Muslim perspective.**

The Islamic faith upholds the Quran as the primary source of religious guidance and rejects the biblical accounts of Jesus as a prophet or the son of God. Muslims believe that Jesus was a messenger of God, but not a deity or king in the traditional sense.

The concept of Jesus as 'King of the Jews' is a theological interpretation within Christianity and does not align with Islamic beliefs or interpretations of the Old Testament.
