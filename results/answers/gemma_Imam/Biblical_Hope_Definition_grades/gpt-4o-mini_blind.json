However, the mixing of Christian and Islamic beliefs in the explanation is not doctrinally correct from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, the inclusion of verses from the Quran and references to Allah are not consistent with a Christian interpretation of hope. The response could have been improved by sticking solely to biblical references and Christian teachings on hope."
