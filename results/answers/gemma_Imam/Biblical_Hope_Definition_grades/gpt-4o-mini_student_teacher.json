  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer regarding the significance of hope in a biblical context and tied it to Islamic tradition, which shows a good understanding of the concept. However, there is a major concern with the answer as it references the Islamic context rather than focusing solely on the Christian perspective. To improve the grade, the student should have focused more on the spiritual foundation of hope specifically within the Christian faith, aligning with a Christian worldview."
