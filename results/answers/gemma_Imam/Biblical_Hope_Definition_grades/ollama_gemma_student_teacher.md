**In a biblical context, the term 'hope' (رَحِيم) signifies:**

* **An assured expectation of future fulfillment:** Hope is based on God's promises and faithfulness. It is not merely a wish or a passing feeling.
* **A confident expectation of good:** Hope focuses on the positive outcome, trusting in God's goodness and mercy.
* **A dynamic virtue:** Hope motivates action and perseverance. It inspires believers to persevere through challenges and maintain a positive attitude.
* **A gift from God:** Hope is not something that we naturally possess; it is a divine gift from Allah.

**The Quran and Sunnah emphasize the importance of hope:**

* The Quran states, "Hope in Allah and be patient." (Surah Al-Imran, verse 150)
* The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "Hope is one of the greatest things."

**Biblical passages that emphasize hope include:**

* "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." (Jeremiah 29:11)
* "Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a fulfilled hope brings joy to the soul." (Proverbs 13:12)
* "Now hope that is seen is not hope for the uncertain, but for the things that are yet to be seen." (Romans 8:24)
