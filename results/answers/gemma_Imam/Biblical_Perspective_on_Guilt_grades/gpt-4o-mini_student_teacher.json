  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with multiple examples from the Bible illustrating the consequences of guilt and sin. However, the answer could have been more focused on the seriousness of sin and its impact on our relationship with God to fully appreciate His grace and mercy. The reference answer specifically highlights the aspect of guilt and deserving punishment, which was not directly addressed in the student's response."
