  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-documented selection of Bible verses illustrating the concept of God's majesty, which align with the Christian worldview. However, the student's response could have been improved by focusing solely on Christian scriptures rather than including an Islamic perspective. In a Christian context, it is important to emphasize the uniqueness and sufficiency of the Bible as the authoritative source of divine revelation. The verses provided are relevant and appropriate for illustrating God's majesty, but additional verses from the reference answer could have strengthened the student's response."
