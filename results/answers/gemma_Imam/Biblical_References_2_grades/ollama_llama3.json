  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nThe concern was to connect scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature, but the provided response only mentions Bible references that illustrate the concept without providing actual verses or connecting them to the understanding of God's majesty. The response also includes an Islamic perspective which is not relevant to the original concern.\n\nA higher grade would require the response to provide specific Bible verses and connect them to the understanding of God's majestic nature, as seen in the original response."
