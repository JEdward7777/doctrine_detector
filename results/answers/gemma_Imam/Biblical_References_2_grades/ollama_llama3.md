**Biblical Verses Illustrating the Concept of God's Majesty:**

"The heavens declare his majesty; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day and night they display the glory of the Lord; the stars and moon stand witness to his splendor."

**5. Colossians 1:16:**
"For by him (Christ) was the universe created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities."

**6. Revelation 1:15:**
"Then I saw under the altar the spirits of those who had been martyred for the word of God, and they cried out with a loud voice, 'How long, O Lord, until your wrath shall be finished?' And a voice from heaven answered them, 'Until the time comes for God to judge the living and the dead."

**Islamic Perspective:**

The concept of God's majesty is also emphasized in Islamic teachings. The Quran and Islamic tradition describe Allah as being majestic, glorious, and worthy of all praise and worship. The verses quoted above align with Islamic beliefs and teachings about the attributes of Allah.

40.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 40.

The concern was to connect scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature, but the provided response only mentions Bible references that illustrate the concept without providing actual verses or connecting them to the understanding of God's majesty. The response also includes an Islamic perspective which is not relevant to the original concern.

A higher grade would require the response to provide specific Bible verses and connect them to the understanding of God's majestic nature, as seen in the original response.
