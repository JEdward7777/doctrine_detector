The verses chosen effectively convey the idea of God's greatness and glory. However, there is a missed opportunity to directly connect the verses provided by the student with the understanding of God's majestic nature. A more in-depth analysis or explanation tying the chosen verses to the concept of God's majesty would have strengthened the response."
