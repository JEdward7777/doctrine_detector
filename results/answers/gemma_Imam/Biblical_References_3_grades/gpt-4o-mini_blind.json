  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: While the student demonstrates knowledge of certain Old Testament passages, the interpretation provided is off track from a Christian perspective. The references presented are not accurately representing the Christian understanding of the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah. The inclusion of Islamic interpretations further confuses the explanation and does not align with Christian doctrine. The student should focus on presenting a correct understanding of the Old Testament references in relation to Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of messianic prophecies."
