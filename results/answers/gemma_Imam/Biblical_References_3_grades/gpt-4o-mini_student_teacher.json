  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant Old Testament references and made connections to Islamic beliefs about the Messiah, but the focus was primarily on Islamic interpretations rather than a Christian understanding. The student missed important references like Daniel 7:14 and did not explore the connection between the Old Testament Son of Man and Jesus as the Messiah in the New Testament. Additionally, the student's interpretation within a Muslim context detracts from the Christian-specific worldview needed for this question. To improve, the student should focus more on connecting the Old Testament references to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Son of Man, the prophesied Messiah."
