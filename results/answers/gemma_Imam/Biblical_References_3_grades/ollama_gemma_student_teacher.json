  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the connection between the Old Testament references and the Islamic understanding of the coming Messiah as the \"Son of Man.\" The inclusion of relevant scriptures and supporting interpretations from Islamic scholarship showcases a thoughtful analysis. However, the grade could be improved by including more specific references from the provided answer and the reference answer to reinforce the connections between the texts and their relevance to the Islamic understanding of the Messiah."
