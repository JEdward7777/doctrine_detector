  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the response does mention some relevant Old Testament references, such as Daniel 7:14, it does not directly address how these references inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\". The majority of the response focuses on Islamic interpretations and parallels between Christian concepts and Islamic beliefs, which is not directly related to the concern.\n\nThe response also lacks a clear connection between the Old Testament references mentioned and the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role. The mention of Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel in the answer provided is a good start, but it is not fully developed or connected to the concern.\n\nTo improve this response, the writer should focus on how the Old Testament references contribute to our understanding of Jesus as the \"Son of Man\" in the New Testament. They could explore themes such as suffering, victory, and righteous leadership, and how these concepts are fulfilled in Jesus' life, death, and resurrection."
