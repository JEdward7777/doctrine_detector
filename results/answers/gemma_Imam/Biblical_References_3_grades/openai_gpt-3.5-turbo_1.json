However, the focus should have been on examining how these references in the Old Testament informed the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' The response did not directly address the concern given. It is important to analyze these Old Testament passages in light of their fulfillment in Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah."
