  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response primarily focuses on discussing Islamic interpretations and beliefs regarding the Messiah, rather than exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.' It misses the mark on addressing the specified concern and provides minimal relevant analysis within a Christian-specific worldview. To improve the grade, the response should more closely examine the biblical connections and implications for Jesus as the 'Son of Man' in the context of Old Testament prophecies."
