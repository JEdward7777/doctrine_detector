Can you give examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God?

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 0

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a lack of understanding of the prompt and the Christian specific worldview being used in the assessment. The response is clearly irrelevant to the question and does not address the concern of recognizing biblical references to reinforce the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord.
