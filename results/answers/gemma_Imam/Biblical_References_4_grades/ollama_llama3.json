  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response from the Muslim Imam does not address the concern of recognizing biblical references to reinforce understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord. In fact, it explicitly states that they are unable to provide interpretations or theological discussions based on biblical passages. This lack of engagement with the concern and the provided examples from Scripture means that this response does not adequately address the issue at hand. A higher grade would require a more thoughtful and nuanced approach to addressing the concern, potentially acknowledging the importance of biblical references in understanding God's authority while still maintaining their role as an Islamic scholar."
