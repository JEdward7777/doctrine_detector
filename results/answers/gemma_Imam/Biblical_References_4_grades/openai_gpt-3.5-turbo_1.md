Can you give examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God?

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided by the Muslim Imam accurately acknowledges the limitations of their expertise in providing interpretations of biblical passages. However, since the concern specifically emphasizes the importance of recognizing biblical references related to God's authority, the response does not address or engage with this concern. A higher grade would have been given if the response had acknowledged the significance of understanding biblical references in relation to God's authority from a Christian perspective.
