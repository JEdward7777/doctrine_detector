  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The response provided by the Muslim Imam is respectful of their faith beliefs and limitations, but it does not engage with the concern raised. In a Christian worldview, understanding biblical references is fundamental to recognizing God's authority and lordship, which is essential for believers. Therefore, a higher grade cannot be awarded as the response does not address the Christian perspective presented in the concern."
