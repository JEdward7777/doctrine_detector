This is doctrinally incorrect as the Qur'an is not a part of the New Testament nor does it connect Christian practices like the use of unleavened bread. In Christian teachings, the concept of unleavened bread is primarily connected to the Last Supper and the Passover in the New Testament, specifically in Matthew 26:17-30 and 1 Corinthians 5:7-8. The focus should be on accurately citing Christian scriptures that relate unleavened bread to Christian teachings."
