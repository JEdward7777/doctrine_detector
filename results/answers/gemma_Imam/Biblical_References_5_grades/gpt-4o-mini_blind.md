## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The New Testament scripture that connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings is the Qur'an itself.**

The Qur'an, in several verses, clearly parallels the Islamic practice of using unleavened bread for religious ceremonies with the Christian tradition. 

**Relevant verses:**

* **Surah Al-A'raf, verse 157:** "They ask you concerning the intoxicants. Say: 'In them is great harm, and from them is benefit. But sustenance is for the believers – for the righteous." (This verse refers to the harmful effects of fermented foods like bread containing yeast.)
* **Surah An-Nisa', verse 5:** "O you who have believed! When the believing men and women come to you concerning loaves of bread which they swear by – give them of it, and do not make them grieve." (This verse encourages Muslims to readily provide unleavened bread to those who swear by it, connecting it to the practice of Christian oaths.)

**These verses clearly establish the connection between the Islamic practice of using unleavened bread and the Christian teachings found in the Qur'an.**

Comment: The response inaccurately identifies the Qur'an as the New Testament scripture linking unleavened bread to Christian teachings. This is doctrinally incorrect as the Qur'an is not a part of the New Testament nor does it connect Christian practices like the use of unleavened bread. In Christian teachings, the concept of unleavened bread is primarily connected to the Last Supper and the Passover in the New Testament, specifically in Matthew 26:17-30 and 1 Corinthians 5:7-8. The focus should be on accurately citing Christian scriptures that relate unleavened bread to Christian teachings.
