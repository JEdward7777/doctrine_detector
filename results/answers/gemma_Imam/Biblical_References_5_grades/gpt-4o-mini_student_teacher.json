  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's response is incorrect as it references the Qur'an, which is not part of the New Testament scriptures that connect the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings. Additionally, the verses provided are not relevant as they are from Islamic scripture and do not provide insight into Christian practices. The student should focus on accurately citing relevant biblical texts in their responses."
