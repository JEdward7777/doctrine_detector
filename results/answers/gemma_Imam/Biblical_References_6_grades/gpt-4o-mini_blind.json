  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: While the student does provide some relevant verses on the resurrection, there are significant doctrinal inaccuracies in the response. The inclusion of a Quranic perspective in a question specifically asking for Bible verses is misleading and not in line with a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student should have focused solely on the Bible verses that directly address the concept of resurrection, instead of including unrelated content. Furthermore, the explanation and insights from the verses lack depth and clarity. The response would benefit greatly from a stronger focus on the Christian perspective on resurrection and a more thorough analysis of the biblical passages provided."
