  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer is partially correct as it includes relevant New Testament verses on the resurrection, particularly focusing on the resurrection of Jesus Christ. However, the inclusion of the Quranic perspective, while interesting from a comparative religion standpoint, strays from the specific focus on Christian scripture as requested in the concern. To improve the grade, the student should stick to biblical verses that provide insight into the concept of resurrection as per the Christian worldview."
