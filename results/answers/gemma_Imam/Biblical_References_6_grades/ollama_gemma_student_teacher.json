  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive overview of biblical passages related to the resurrection across both Testaments.\n* Inclusion of Quranic references demonstrating awareness of different faith perspectives.\n* Detailed analysis of the significance of Jesus Christ's resurrection as the ultimate manifestation of God's power and love.\n* Clear articulation of the hope and new life offered through the resurrection.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The student did not address the concern regarding grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts as explicitly as requested.\n* Some of the references to the Old Testament could benefit from further elaboration and context.\n* The inclusion of the Quran is not entirely relevant to the Christian specific worldview.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could strengthen their answer by providing more direct engagement with the concern about grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts. This could include referencing specific scriptures that explicitly address the importance of scripture in Christian belief.\n* The student could also elaborate more on the context and interpretation of the Old Testament references they included.\n* While including the Quran demonstrates awareness of different faith perspectives, it may be more appropriate to focus on relevant Christian scriptures for the specified worldview."
