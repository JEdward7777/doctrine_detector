## [Answer](../Biblical_References_6.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Biblical Verses on the Resurrection:**

**1. Quranic Perspective:**

* The Quran emphasizes the resurrection of the dead as a fundamental belief of Islam.
* Surah Al-Anfal, verse 56: "Say, 'The Hour (of judgement) will surely come to you; with it We shall gather you all together.' "

**2. New Testament:**

* **Resurrection of Jesus Christ:**
    * Matthew 28:6-7: "He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Remember how he told you, 'I am going away, but I will come back to you again.' "
    * Mark 16:6: "He is not here. He has risen, just as he said."
    * Luke 24:3-5: "But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. And the angels said to her, 'Do not weep; for he is not here, but he has risen.'"
* **Resurrection of Others:**
    * 1 Corinthians 15:12-14: "The death that reigns over these is the result of sin, but the life that reigns is the result of God's grace through Jesus Christ our Lord... For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all are made alive... For as in the Adam was the first man of the earth, so also in Christ was the first man from the dead."

**3. Old Testament:**

* **Resurrection of the Dead in the Afterlife:**
    * Ezekiel 37:1-10: "Then I will give them new hearts and a new spirit; I will remove the heart of stone from them and give them a heart of flesh... And I will bring forth from the graves those who have been gathered in the dust... And they shall know that I am the Lord."

**Insights from these Verses:**

* The resurrection is a central belief of both Islam and Christianity, based on the Quran and the New Testament.
* The resurrection of Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate manifestation of God's power and love.
* The resurrection is a promise of hope and new life for believers.
* The resurrection teaches us that death is not the end, but rather a temporary separation from the body.

**Areas for Improvement:**
