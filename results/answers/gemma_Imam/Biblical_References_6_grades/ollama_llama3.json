However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern of focusing on scripture as key for grounding beliefs and teachings. While it mentions some Bible verses that discuss resurrection and eternal life, it does not specifically highlight how these scriptures are authoritative Christian texts that should be studied and applied.\n\nTo improve the response, consider adding more specific examples of how the biblical verses discussed relate to the original concern. For instance, you could explain how studying and applying scripture can help Christians better understand and apply the doctrine of resurrection, or how it provides a foundation for hope and new life in Christ. By explicitly addressing the concern and providing more context, you can strengthen your response and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the biblical texts and their relevance to Christian theology."
