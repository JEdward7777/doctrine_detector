The inclusion of relevant verses from Corinthians, Peter, Hebrews, John, and Luke aligns well with the concern of grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts. The response effectively integrates Islamic perspectives on resurrection while primarily focusing on Christian scriptures. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic, although some additional analysis or personal reflection could enhance the depth of the discussion."
