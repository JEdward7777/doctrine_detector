70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** While the student's response demonstrates an understanding of the need to refer to reliable sources for religious guidance, it lacks specificity in addressing the Christian-specific worldview concern.
