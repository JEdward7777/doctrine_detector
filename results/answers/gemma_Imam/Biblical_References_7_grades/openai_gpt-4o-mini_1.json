  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response appropriately addresses the concern by providing relevant scriptural references from the Bible supporting the observance of the Sabbath in Christian faith. However, the response doesn't directly engage with the Christian perspective on interpreting other religious texts, which was the primary concern. Further elaboration or explanation in that regard would have strengthened the response."
