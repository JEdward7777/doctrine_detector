  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has effectively referenced Bible verses that mention the concept of ransom and attempted to explain their contribution to the understanding of redemption. However, the student's inclusion of Islamic theology and the comparison with Christianity detracts from the focus on exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. To improve the grade, the student should have focused solely on analyzing the selected Bible verses and their implications for the Christian understanding of redemption."
