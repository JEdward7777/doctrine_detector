  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good range of Bible verses referencing ransom and offers some insight into the understanding of redemption in both Islamic and Christian contexts. However, the candidate did not deeply delve into the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption as specifically requested. The response could have been strengthened by providing more analysis of the selected Bible verses and connecting them to the broader biblical narrative of redemption through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ."
