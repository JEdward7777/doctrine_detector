  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of covenant faithfulness from both Islamic and Christian perspectives. However, the student's answer primarily focuses on Quranic verses and lacks specific references to the Bible, which was the main requirement of the question. In a Christian worldview, Biblical references are crucial for discussing covenant faithfulness. Therefore, the student's answer is incomplete and does not fully address the concern of connecting scriptural examples specifically from the Bible."
