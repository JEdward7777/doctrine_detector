  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response effectively connects scriptural examples from the Quran and the Bible to the concept of covenant faithfulness in both Islamic and Christian traditions. The commentary provides insightful interpretations of the verses presented. However, it could have delved deeper into the specific references provided in the answer for a more comprehensive analysis. Overall, a solid understanding of covenant faithfulness is demonstrated, but more emphasis on the given references would strengthen the response."
