  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: \nOverall, this response provides a solid analysis of the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith based on the passages from Acts and Galatians. The student effectively highlights key points from the scriptures and draws connections to the overarching theme of radical inclusion in Christianity. However, there is room for improvement in providing deeper theological insights and unpacking the significance of Paul's specific teachings on the inclusion of Gentiles. Encouraging the student to delve further into the doctrinal implications of Gentile inclusion would strengthen the overall response."
