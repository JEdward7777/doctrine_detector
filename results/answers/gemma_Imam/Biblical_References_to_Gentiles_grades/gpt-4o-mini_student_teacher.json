  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student did a good job providing a detailed explanation of the passages and how they demonstrate the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith, they missed the key emphasis on faith in Jesus rather than adherence to the law as the basis for justification before God. This central theme of faith over legalism is crucial in understanding the grace and inclusion extended to Gentiles in Christianity. Encouraging the student to focus more on this central aspect of the passages would improve their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
