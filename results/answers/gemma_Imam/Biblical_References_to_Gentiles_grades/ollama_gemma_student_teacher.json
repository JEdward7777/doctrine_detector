The student clearly articulates the cultural and religious barriers that existed between Jews and Gentiles, and how God's revelation to Paul signifies the radical inclusion of Gentiles. Additionally, the student provides insightful analysis of Paul's arguments in Galatians 2:16 regarding the removal of barriers of ethnicity and cultural separation."
