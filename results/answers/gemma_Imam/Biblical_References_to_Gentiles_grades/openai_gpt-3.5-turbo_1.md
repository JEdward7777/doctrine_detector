## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Gentiles.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Acts 9:13-16:**

These verses tell the story of the Apostle Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus. God reveals to him that he is chosen to proclaim the gospel to both Jews and Gentiles. This exchange signifies the radical inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian faith.

- Paul's initial reluctance to reach out to Gentiles demonstrates the prevailing cultural and religious barriers between Jews and gentiles.
- God's command to Paul to "open their eyes" symbolizes the revelation of a new understanding and inclusion of Gentiles.

**Galatians 2:16:**

This verse emphasizes that Christ is the mediator between God and humanity, removing any barriers of ethnicity or cultural separation. 

- Paul argues that circumcision and other religious practices were not essential for salvation.
- This liberation from cultural restrictions further underscores the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith.

**Conclusion:**

These passages demonstrate the radical inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. God's love and salvation are available to all, regardless of ethnicity or cultural background. The inclusion of Gentiles was a pivotal moment in the history of Christianity, breaking down barriers and expanding the reach of the gospel.
