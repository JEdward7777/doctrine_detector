  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion, particularly in relation to the apostolic mission to Gentiles and the emphasis on faith in Jesus for justification. The analysis of how these passages reflect radical inclusion and the breakdown of cultural barriers aligns well with a Christian worldview. The only minor critique is that further elaboration or analysis could have deepened the explanation, earning a near perfect score."
