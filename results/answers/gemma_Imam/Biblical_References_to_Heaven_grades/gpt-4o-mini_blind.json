  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed list of verses referencing the concept of heaven, they included verses from the Quran, which is not consistent with a Christian worldview. In a Christian-specific context, it is important to focus solely on biblical references when discussing the concept of heaven. The student did include relevant verses from the Old and New Testaments, but the inclusion of non-biblical sources significantly detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the answer. The answer would have been much stronger if it stayed within the boundaries of Christian scripture."
