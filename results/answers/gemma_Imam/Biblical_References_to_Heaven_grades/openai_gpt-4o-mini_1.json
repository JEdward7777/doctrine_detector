  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good selection of biblical verses and references from the Quran that pertain to the concept of heaven. However, since the focus of the answer was on biblical references provided in the initial response, there is a lack of integration or explanation of the additional verses and passages shared here. The selected verses offer insightful perspectives on heaven, but their relevance to the specific biblical texts mentioned in the original answer could have been more explicitly drawn out. Including more analysis and connection between the verses mentioned in the response and those provided in the original answer would have strengthened the overall response."
