The Festival of Weeks, also known as Pentecost, is not primarily celebrated by Christians - it is a Jewish festival. Additionally, the mention of Islamic tradition and Eid al-Adha in connection to the Festival of Weeks is not accurate from a Christian perspective. The response would benefit from focusing solely on the biblical references and significance of the Festival of Weeks without introducing inaccurate information about Islamic traditions."
