  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided some correct references to the Festival of Weeks in Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, but the answer lacked accuracy and depth. The inclusion of Islamic tradition in relation to the festival is not relevant to the question asked, which focused on the significance within a Christian worldview. The student's response did not address the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost, which was the primary concern. Additional references to 2 Chronicles and Acts were also missing, as indicated in the teacher's reference answer."
