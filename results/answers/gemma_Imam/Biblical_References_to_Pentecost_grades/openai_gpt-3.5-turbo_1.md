**Books of the Bible containing references to the Festival of Weeks:**

* **Genesis:** The story of Abraham and Isaac, who celebrated the festival after sacrificing their son as an act of obedience to God. (Genesis 22:1-19)
* **Exodus:** God institutes the Festival of Weeks (originally called the Feast of Weeks) as a seven-day celebration to commemorate the Israelites' escape from Egypt. (Exodus 34:22-23)
* **Numbers:** Instructions are given regarding the offering of sacrifices and the rituals associated with the festival. (Numbers 29:15-35)
* **Deuteronomy:** A summary of the festival's significance and observance is provided. (Deuteronomy 16:9-12)

**Significance of the Festival of Weeks in Islamic tradition:**

While the Festival of Weeks is primarily celebrated by Christians, it holds significance in Islamic tradition as well. Muslims acknowledge the festival as a significant religious celebration for Christians and respect the rituals associated with it. Some Islamic scholars view the Festival of Weeks as a foreshadowing of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, which has similarities in its sacrificial practices.

Grade: 50

Comment: The provided response correctly lists references to the Festival of Weeks in different books of the Bible. However, the response deviates from the concern of understanding the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. The mention of Islamic tradition and its views on the festival is not relevant to the given concern, thus lowering the grade. The response should have focused solely on the Christian scriptural basis for Pentecost.
