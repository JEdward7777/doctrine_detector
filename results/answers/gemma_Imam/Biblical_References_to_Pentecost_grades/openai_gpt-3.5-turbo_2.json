  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided lists some books that reference the Festival of Weeks from a Christian perspective, which is a good start. However, the inclusion of Islamic traditions in relation to the Festival of Weeks is not relevant to the Christian scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. Additionally, the response does not match the specified concern directly, as the focus should be on the scriptural basis for Pentecost. Some specific verses or explanations from the mentioned books would have strengthened the answer."
