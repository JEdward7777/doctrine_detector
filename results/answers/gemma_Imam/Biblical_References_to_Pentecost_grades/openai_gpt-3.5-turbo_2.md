**Books of the Bible containing references to the Festival of Weeks:**

* **Genesis:** The story of Abraham and Isaac, who celebrated the festival after sacrificing their son as an act of obedience to God. (Genesis 22:1-19)
* **Exodus:** God institutes the Festival of Weeks (originally called the Feast of Weeks) as a seven-day celebration to commemorate the Israelites' escape from Egypt. (Exodus 34:22-23)
* **Numbers:** Instructions are given regarding the offering of sacrifices and the rituals associated with the festival. (Numbers 29:15-35)
* **Deuteronomy:** A summary of the festival's significance and observance is provided. (Deuteronomy 16:9-12)

**Significance of the Festival of Weeks in Islamic tradition:**

While the Festival of Weeks is primarily celebrated by Christians, it holds significance in Islamic tradition as well. Muslims acknowledge the festival as a significant religious celebration for Christians and respect the rituals associated with it. Some Islamic scholars view the Festival of Weeks as a foreshadowing of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, which has similarities in its sacrificial practices.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provided lists some books that reference the Festival of Weeks from a Christian perspective, which is a good start. However, the inclusion of Islamic traditions in relation to the Festival of Weeks is not relevant to the Christian scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. Additionally, the response does not match the specified concern directly, as the focus should be on the scriptural basis for Pentecost. Some specific verses or explanations from the mentioned books would have strengthened the answer.
