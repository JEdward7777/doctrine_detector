However, the interpretation focused more on the general themes of faithfulness, integrity, and prophecies, rather than specifically emphasizing Jesus as the Savior who delivers believers from sin. Additionally, the connection to Islam, while interesting, detracted from the focus on Jesus as the central figure of salvation in Christianity. A stronger emphasis on Jesus as the Savior and the foundation of Christian faith would have been more appropriate for addressing the concern provided."
