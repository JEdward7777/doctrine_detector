The conclusion should have focused on the foundational Christian belief in Jesus as the Savior who provides salvation from sin, rather than attempting to draw parallels with Islamic teachings. The response missed addressing the concern of understanding the scriptural foundations for the belief in Jesus as Savior from a Christian perspective."
