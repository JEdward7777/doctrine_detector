## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
Within the Quran, there are verses that acknowledge Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, but they do not explicitly reference him as the cornerstone. The Islamic perspective emphasizes the Quran as the primary source of guidance and belief.

However, there are Bible verses that speak of Jesus Christ as the cornerstone. These verses convey His central role in Christianity. Some relevant passages are:

**1. Ephesians 2:20:** "Christ himself is the cornerstone and the foundation of the temple."

**Interpretation:** This verse highlights Jesus as the foundational element of the Church, the spiritual temple built upon His teachings and sacrifice.

**2. 1 Peter 2:6:** "For you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, destined to proclaim the praises of the one who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light."

**Interpretation:** This verse emphasizes Jesus as the source of spiritual enlightenment and redemption, offering hope and purpose to believers.

**3. Hebrews 8:5:** "For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices."

**Interpretation:** This verse implies that Jesus is the ultimate high priest, offering himself as the perfect sacrifice for sins.

**4. Colossians 2:19:** "For in him all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form."

**Interpretation:** This verse highlights Jesus' divine nature, where the fullness of God is embodied in His person.

These verses demonstrate that in Christianity, Jesus Christ is considered the cornerstone, representing the foundation and center of faith, redemption, and spiritual life.
