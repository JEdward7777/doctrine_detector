  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student provided a detailed explanation of Bible verses that emphasize Jesus Christ's central role in Christianity. However, the student should have focused on providing verses that specifically reference Jesus as the cornerstone. While their interpretation of the verses is insightful, it deviates from the question's specific focus. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer connection between the chosen verses and the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone."
