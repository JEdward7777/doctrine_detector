  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response exceeds the expectation of exploring scriptural references to demonstrate Jesus' significance in faith, as per the concern. The provided Bible verses not only highlight Jesus as the cornerstone but also offer insightful interpretations that emphasize His role in redemption, spiritual life, and the foundation of the Church. The inclusion of various passages from different books of the Bible (Ephesians, 1 Peter, Hebrews, and Colossians) further strengthens the argument.\n\nThe only deduction is for not explicitly referencing Acts 4:11, Matthew 21:42, or Psalms 118:22, as mentioned in the original answer. However, the response still effectively illustrates Jesus' importance by providing a range of relevant Bible passages that convey His central role in Christianity.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a thorough understanding of Scripture and effectively encourages believers to explore God's Word for themselves, deepening their comprehension of Jesus' significance in faith."
