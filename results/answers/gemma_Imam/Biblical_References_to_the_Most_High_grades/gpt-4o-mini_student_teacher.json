  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed analysis of Bible verses that reinforce the idea of God as the 'Most High' and offered insights into His character traits. However, the response strayed off topic by including a section on relevance to Islamic belief, which was not required in the context of exploring Scripture through a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student missed the specific Bible verses provided in the reference answer. The student showed good effort in understanding God's sovereignty but needs to focus more on directly addressing the Christian perspective and the verses given in the question."
