The student provides several relevant Bible verses and clearly explains how they reinforce the idea of God's immense power, sovereignty, and transcendence. The inclusion of Islamic beliefs adds an additional dimension to the analysis, highlighting the similarities between Christian and Islamic conceptions of God's grandeur."
