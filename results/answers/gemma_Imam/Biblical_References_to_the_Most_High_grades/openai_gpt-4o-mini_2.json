However, the conclusion, tying these verses to Islamic beliefs about Allah, may be confusing or misleading for Christians. The response could have better addressed the concern by specifically focusing on the Christian understanding of God's sovereignty based on the given Bible verses, rather than interfaith comparisons. Further explanation of the scriptural significance of God's sovereignty in the Christian faith would have strengthened the response."
