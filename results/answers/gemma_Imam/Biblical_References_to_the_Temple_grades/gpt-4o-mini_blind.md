Comment: The answer correctly identifies that scriptures referring to the temple as the 'house of Yahweh' are found in the Old Testament. However, the response unnecessarily brings up Islam and its beliefs, leading to a slight digression from the question at hand. It would have been better to focus solely on providing the biblical references rather than mentioning the context of another religion.
