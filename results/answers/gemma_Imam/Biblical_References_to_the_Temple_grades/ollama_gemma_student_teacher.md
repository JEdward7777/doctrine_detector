**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 

The student's answer correctly identifies the scriptures that specifically reference the temple as the 'house of Yahweh' in the Old Testament. However, the answer is limited by its exclusion of its relevance to the Muslim context and background. The response does not address the concern of identifying key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house from a Christian specific worldview.
