Grade: 95

Comment: The response accurately identifies key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as the 'house of Yahweh'. The connection between the temple and God's dwelling place is clearly highlighted, reflecting a solid understanding of this biblical concept. The deduction of points is due to the response not addressing the Muslim context and background in relation to the temple and Yahweh, as this comparison could have added depth to the analysis.
