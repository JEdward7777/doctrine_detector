  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided a response that completely avoids engaging with the question from a Christian worldview. It is important for the student to demonstrate an understanding of the biblical concept of \"woe\" and God's judgment as presented in the Bible. Encouraging the student to delve into Scripture and provide insight from a Christian perspective would result in a higher grade."
