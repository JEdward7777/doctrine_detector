  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response addresses the concern by providing specific biblical examples that highlight the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. However, it falls short of being a comprehensive exploration of this concern. The response focuses solely on the theme of \"woe\" and its association with severe judgment, without delving deeper into the nuances of divine judgment or exploring its implications for Christian living. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates an understanding of relevant biblical texts and provides a clear answer to the question."
