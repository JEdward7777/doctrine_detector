Comment: The response appropriately references specific biblical verses that highlight the seriousness of divine judgment, demonstrating a good understanding of the concern raised. However, deducting some points for not providing further analysis or interpretation from a Christian perspective, which could have enriched the response. Overall, a solid effort in addressing the concern with relevant scriptural references.
