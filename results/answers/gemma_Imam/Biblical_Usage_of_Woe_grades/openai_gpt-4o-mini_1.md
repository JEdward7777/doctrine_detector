Grade: 85

Comment: The response appropriately incorporates scriptural references to demonstrate the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. However, the initial disclaimer about being unable to provide interpretations from a religious perspective could be perceived as a lack of confidence in applying a Christian worldview to the issue. Nonetheless, the use of relevant verses to address the concern is commendable.
