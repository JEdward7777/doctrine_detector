Grade: 90

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of how the concept of divine judgment is described in specific biblical passages. The student effectively references relevant verses to support their point, displaying a strong knowledge of Christian teachings on divine judgment. However, the initial disclaimer provided in the first response detracts slightly from fully engaging with the concern raised, as it is important to consider a Christian worldview when discussing biblical interpretations. Overall, a solid response with room for further engagement with a Christian perspective.
