  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 50\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the topic and fails to address the concern related to Christian worldview. The statement that altar construction is not permissible within Islam is irrelevant to the question and does not contribute to a deeper understanding of biblical practices. The partial response provides some general information about altar materials but lacks theological or historical depth."
