  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response accurately provides information on the materials and structure of altars, the concern raised from a Christian worldview is not addressed, leading to a limited understanding of the significance of altars in biblical practices and worship. A higher grade could be achieved by linking the provided information with the importance of altars in Christian worship and connecting it to biblical references."
