Grade: 20/100

Comment: The student did not accurately address the question as it specifically inquired about commands given to believers regarding personal sanctification. The response provided Islamic teachings from the Quran, Sunnah, and Imamly guidance which are not aligned with a Christian worldview. The student should have specifically referenced Biblical commands such as 1 Thessalonians 4:3 which states, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification." In a Christian worldview, personal sanctification is primarily achieved through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance of sins, and obedience to God's Word. It is important to focus on addressing the question from a Christian perspective to receive a higher grade.
