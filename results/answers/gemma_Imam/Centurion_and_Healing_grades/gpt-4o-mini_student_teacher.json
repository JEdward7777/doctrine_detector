  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus in a Muslim context, focusing on faith, authority, humility, and submission. However, the response strayed from the Christian-specific worldview as requested. The student made insightful connections but should have emphasized the Christian understanding of faith and authority within Jesus' ministry. Encouraging them to delve deeper into the biblical teachings on faith and authority would enhance their response significantly."
