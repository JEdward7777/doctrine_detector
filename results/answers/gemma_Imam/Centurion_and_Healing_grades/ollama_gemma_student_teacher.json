  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus, highlighting key aspects of faith and authority in the context of Jesus' ministry. The student clearly articulates the significance of faith in divine power, humility and submission, the unity of faith, and the subordination of human authority to the divine will. However, the answer could benefit from tighter integration of the provided concern about the Christian worldview and more direct connection to the reference answer."
