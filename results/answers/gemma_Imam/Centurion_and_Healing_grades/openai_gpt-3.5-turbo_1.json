It effectively addresses the concern by exploring various aspects of faith, humility, and submission in relation to Jesus' ministry. The connection to the Muslim context is well-explained, highlighting important lessons that can be learned. However, there could be a more explicit integration of Christian-specific doctrines or beliefs to further enrich the analysis."
