  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful response to the question, demonstrating a sound understanding of how the centurion's visit from Peter represents the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community. The student effectively highlighted key aspects related to the inclusivity of the Gospel and the mission of the Church to reach all nations. The answer was well-structured and supported by relevant examples and explanations. However, the grade is slightly lower than the reference answer because the response could have been more concise and directly aligned with the specific concern provided."
