I would give this response a grade of 80.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the centurion's visit from Peter as a key moment in the expansion of the Gospel beyond its Jewish roots. The writer correctly identifies the universality of the Gospel message, highlighting God's love and salvation for all people. They also touch on the inclusivity of the Gospel, recognizing that it is open to all who are willing to accept it.

The response could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or biblical references to support its claims. Additionally, while the writer mentions the Church's future growth beyond its Jewish roots, they do not explicitly state how this event prefigured that growth or what implications this has for the Church's mission today.

Overall, however, this is a solid response that demonstrates a good understanding of the centurion's visit from Peter and its significance in the context of the Church's mission to reach all nations.
