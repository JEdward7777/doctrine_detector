However, the response could be enhanced by including more emphasis on the doctrinal significance of the centurion's confession, such as how it aligns with the affirmation of Jesus' divinity and role in salvation, as emphasized in Christian theology. Additionally, the caution against over-interpreting the centurion's reaction should be balanced with the acknowledgement of its spiritual significance as affirmed in Christian belief. Further integration of Christian doctrinal teachings would strengthen the response."
