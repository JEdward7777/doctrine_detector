  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of qualities defining an 'upright' person in the biblical context from an Islamic perspective. While the qualities highlighted align with principles of integrity, justice, and compassion, the answer lacks explicit reference to key biblical teachings and scriptures that define righteousness in Christianity. Additionally, the emphasis on Islamic values without drawing direct parallels to specific biblical examples or teachings reduces the doctrinal correctness of the response. Encouragement to deepen the analysis by incorporating direct references to biblical passages and teachings would enhance the grade."
