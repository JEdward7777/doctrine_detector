Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a detailed response identifying qualities of an upright person in the biblical context, drawing parallels with Islamic values. While the student mentioned relevant traits such as honesty, compassion, and fear of God, there was a lack of emphasis on the foundational aspect of obedience to God's laws and living a God-pleasing life. The response would have been stronger if it focused more explicitly on the fundamental biblical perspective of obedience and moral purity.
