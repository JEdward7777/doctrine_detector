Grade: 0

Comment: The student's answer is completely irrelevant to the question asked, as it pertains to Islamic tradition rather than the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel. The student did not engage with the Christian worldview concerning the ancient Israelite religious leadership structure at all.
