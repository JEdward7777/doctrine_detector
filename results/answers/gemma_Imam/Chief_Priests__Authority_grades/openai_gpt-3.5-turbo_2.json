  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately points out the hierarchical structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel with chief priests holding higher authority. However, the response does not fully address the concern as it focuses on the structure of ancient Israel rather than the absence of priests or chief priests in Islamic tradition. Thus, the response could have been more tailored to directly address the concern."
