**Biblical Instruction Regarding Honoring Parents:**

The Bible teaches that children are to honor their parents as a commandment from God. This is evident in several passages:

* **Ephesians 6:2:** "Honor your father and mother, as is fitting for the saints."
* **Colossians 3:20:** "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
* **Proverbs 15:20:** "A son who honors his father is blessed, but a son who disobeys his mother brings shame."

**Interpretation Within Islamic Context:**

These biblical instructions align with Islamic values and teachings. Islam emphasizes the importance of respecting and honoring parents, who are considered to be among the most deserving of respect. The Quran and Sunnah both encourage children to be obedient and kind to their parents.

**Practical Implications:**

Honoring parents includes:

* **Respectful behavior:** Using polite language, listening attentively, and valuing their opinions.
* **Practical assistance:** Assisting them with chores, errands, or medical needs.
* **Affectionate communication:** Maintaining a close and caring relationship.
* **Compliance with their guidance:** Following their advice and teachings.

* The Bible's command to honor parents is not limited to biological parents. It also applies to foster parents or those who have taken parental roles in a child's life.
* Honoring parents is not merely a physical act but also an attitude of respect and reverence.
* The Quran and Sunnah provide further guidance on the importance of honoring parents and the consequences of disobeying them.
