  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response discussing the impact of being referred to as 'children of God' from an Islamic perspective. While the points made are well-explained and insightful, the response did not align with the Christian worldview specified in the reference answer. The student's answer focused on Islamic beliefs rather than Christian beliefs, which significantly deviates from the context of the question and concern provided. It is important for the student to adjust their response to reflect a Christian-specific understanding of being called 'children of God' in relation to believers."
