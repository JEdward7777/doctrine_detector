However, the response does not directly address the concern raised regarding deepening faith and sense of belonging within the Christian community. In a Christian worldview, while there may be some similarities in the understanding of believers as children of God between Islam and Christianity, the theological nuances and the specific relationship dynamics differ. Thus, the response could have been strengthened by acknowledging and addressing this concern more directly to align with a Christian understanding of being children of God."
