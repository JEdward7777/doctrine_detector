  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed overview of how the term \"Christ\" evolved in the New Testament, there are significant shortcomings from a Christian worldview perspective. The student does not adequately address the foundational Christian belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. There is a lack of emphasis on key Christian doctrines such as the deity of Christ, His role in redemption, and the significance of His sacrificial death. Additionally, the student's response lacks a clear connection to the core Christian teachings on Christology. More focus on Christ as the central figure in Christianity and His divine nature would improve the grade."
