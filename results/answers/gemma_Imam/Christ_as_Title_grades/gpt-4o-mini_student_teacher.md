I would grade this student's answer as a 70.

While the student provided a detailed and informative response on the evolution of the term "Christ" in the New Testament, they missed the crucial point of recognizing the significance of the title 'Christ' in deepening understanding of Jesus's identity and purpose. The student focused more on the historical and linguistic evolution of the term without specifically addressing how this deepens the understanding of Jesus as the Savior. 

To improve their answer, the student should have explicitly connected the evolution of the term "Christ" to the deepening understanding of Jesus's identity as the Savior and how this understanding impacts Christian beliefs and practices. It is essential to maintain a Christian worldview perspective when discussing such topics.
