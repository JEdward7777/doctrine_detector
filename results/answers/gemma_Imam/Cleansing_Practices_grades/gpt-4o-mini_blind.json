  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response with practical suggestions for modern Christians to adopt practices reflecting the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness. The suggestions align well with biblical principles and emphasize the importance of physical and spiritual purification. The answer could have been strengthened by including more specific references to Old Testament laws and rituals on cleanliness to provide a deeper theological grounding. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful response."
