- Living in accordance with Islamic laws and principles.
- Avoiding actions that are prohibited or discouraged in Islam.


**2. Honesty and Transparency:**
- Being truthful in speech and actions.
- Maintaining integrity and sincerity in dealing with others.


**3. Accountability to Allah:**
- Recognizing that our actions will be judged by Allah.
- Maintaining a clear conscience by fulfilling our responsibilities and avoiding wrongdoing.


**4. Self-Reflection:**
- Regularly examining our thoughts, words, and deeds.
- Seeking to identify areas for improvement and growth in our moral character.


**5. Avoiding Deception and Manipulation:**
- Maintaining purity of heart and intention.
- Avoiding actions that could deceive or harm others.


**6. Performing Good Deeds:**
- Engaging in acts of kindness, charity, and obedience to Allah.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured answer, drawing parallels between the concept of a "clear conscience" and Islamic teachings on ethics, honesty, accountability to Allah, self-reflection, and performing good deeds. The response accurately captures the essence of maintaining a clear conscience within an Islamic framework. However, the lack of direct reference to how a clear conscience is specifically understood or emphasized within Christian teachings is a notable gap. Expanding on the distinct Christian perspective on a clear conscience would have strengthened the answer further.
