  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out explanation of the concept of a clear conscience within Islamic teachings. While the response did not directly align with the Christian perspective provided in the reference answer, the student effectively highlighted the importance of ethical principles, accountability, and self-reflection in maintaining a clear conscience according to Islamic beliefs. The response could be strengthened by further connecting these principles to the concept of obedience to God and the avoidance of sin, as emphasized in the Christian worldview."
