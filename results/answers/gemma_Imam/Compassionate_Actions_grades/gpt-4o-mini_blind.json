However, the focus on Islamic greetings at the beginning and the recurring theme of fostering relationships with Allah may not align well with a Christian worldview. It would have been more appropriate to emphasize the Christian understanding of compassion being rooted in the nature of God and our call to imitate Christ's love and compassion towards others. Additionally, the student could have included a broader range of biblical examples to showcase the diverse manifestations of compassion in Scripture."
