They provide well-articulated examples from Scripture to support their claims. \n\nThe inclusion of Islamic references to the Quran and Sunnah adds an additional dimension to the discussion, demonstrating the universality of compassion in different religious traditions.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from including more specific examples from the Bible that align with the teacher's reference answer, such as Daniel's refusal to defile himself, Hosea's love for an unfaithful spouse, and Jesus healing the sick. Including these references would strengthen the student's response and demonstrate a closer alignment with the provided concern."
