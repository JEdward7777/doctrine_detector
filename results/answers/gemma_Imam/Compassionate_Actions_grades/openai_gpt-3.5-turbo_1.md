# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Assalamu'alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.**

The concept of compassion is deeply rooted in both the Quran and the Sunnah. While the Quran emphasizes the importance of compassion towards fellow Muslims, it also encourages Muslims to show compassion towards non-Muslims.

There are numerous examples in the Bible where individuals demonstrated compassion. Here are a few notable ones:

**1. The Compassion of Jesus Christ:**

* Jesus displayed immense compassion towards the sick, the ostracized, and the marginalized. 
* He healed the sick, comforted the grieving, and showed love to those who were despised by society.

**2. The Widow's Son:**

* In the Gospel of Mark, a widow approaches Jesus mourning the death of her only son. Jesus shows compassion and raises her son back to life.

**3. The Paralytic Man:**

* In the Gospel of John, a paralyzed man is brought to Jesus by his friends. Jesus heals the man, demonstrating compassion for his physical suffering.

**4. The Good Samaritan:**

* This parable highlights the importance of showing compassion to those in need, regardless of their background or beliefs.

**5. The Story of Job:**

* Job experiences immense suffering and loss, but he remains steadfast in his faith and displays unwavering compassion towards others.

**6. The Compassion of King David:**

* David shows compassion towards his enemies, offering them forgiveness and reconciliation.

These examples demonstrate the profound impact of compassion on individuals and communities. By embodying the spirit of compassion, Muslims can foster stronger relationships with others, create a more just and peaceful society, and please Allah.

**Remember:**

* Compassion is not just about material aid or physical healing. It is about offering emotional and spiritual support to those in need.
* True compassion involves understanding the suffering of others and offering support without judgment.
* Compassion is a quality that can transform both the giver and the receiver.
