## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Matthew 12:7:**

"Do not judge, and you shall not be judged. Forgive others, and you shall be forgiven."

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of mercy and forgiveness in the Islamic context. It teaches us that when we judge or condemn others, we are essentially perpetuating a cycle of negativity. Instead, we should focus on forgiving others and showing compassion, as this will ultimately lead to our own liberation.


**Psalms 34:22:**

"The Lord is faithful in love and forgiveness; abundant in mercy."

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the immense love and forgiveness of Allah. It reminds us that Allah is always willing to forgive us of our sins and mistakes. This teaches us that punishment should never be seen as the ultimate consequence of wrongdoing. Allah's punishment is always accompanied by his mercy and forgiveness.


**Implications for our perspective on punishment:**

* **Focus on forgiveness and reconciliation:** The teachings of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 encourage us to prioritize forgiveness and reconciliation over punishment.
* **Acknowledge the transformative power of mercy:** Mercy is not merely the absence of punishment but a conscious act of compassion that can lead to genuine transformation.
* **View punishment as an opportunity for growth:** While punishment may be necessary in certain circumstances, it should be seen as an opportunity for individuals to learn from their mistakes and grow closer to Allah.
* **Emphasize the importance of context:** The application of punishment should always be fair and appropriate, considering the specific context and circumstances.
