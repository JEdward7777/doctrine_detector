  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: While the student provided interpretations of the verses from Matthew and Psalms, the interpretations were incorrect and did not align with a Christian worldview. The student referred to Allah instead of the Christian God, and the interpretations of the verses did not accurately reflect the Christian teachings on forgiveness, mercy, and punishment. The response lacked doctrinal correctness and presented a perspective that is not in line with Christian beliefs. An accurate understanding of the biblical verses and a correct interpretation within a Christian context is crucial for a higher grade."
