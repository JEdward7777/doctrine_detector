The response focuses more on the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation but lacks a comprehensive discussion on how justice and mercy intersect in the context of punishment, particularly from a Christian worldview. Additional exploration and discussion of how punitive measures can be just and merciful simultaneously would strengthen the response."
