## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to Paul's writings, confessing that Jesus is Lord is essential for salvation.** He writes in Romans 10:9-10, "If you confess that Jesus is Lord, you will be saved."

**However, this confession must be accompanied by faith in God's love and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.** Simply repeating the words "Jesus is Lord" without a genuine belief in his lordship and salvation will not suffice.

**Paul emphasizes that salvation is a gift from God:**

* "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8).

**The confession of Jesus as Lord is a declaration of faith in his lordship and authority as the Son of God.** It is acknowledging that Jesus is the only one who can save us from our sins and give us eternal life.

**Therefore, confessing that Jesus is Lord is an integral part of the process of salvation according to Paul's teachings.**
