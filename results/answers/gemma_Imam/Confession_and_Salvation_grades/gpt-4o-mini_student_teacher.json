  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the importance of confessing Jesus as Lord for salvation according to Paul's writings. They correctly emphasize the need for genuine faith and belief in Jesus as part of the confession. The student also incorporates key biblical references to support their points. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and they could have directly referenced Paul's specific statement on confessing Jesus as Lord and being saved for a clearer connection to the teacher's reference answer."
