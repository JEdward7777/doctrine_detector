The steps outlined reflect the importance of acknowledging, resisting, seeking forgiveness, relying on God's Word and prayer, avoiding temptation, focusing on God's goodness, and seeking growth in faith. The inclusion of specific Bible verses to support each point enhances the doctrinal correctness of the answer. Well done!"
