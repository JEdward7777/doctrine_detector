  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-rounded answer on what a Christian should do when tempted to sin according to the Bible. They emphasized acknowledging and resisting temptation, seeking God's forgiveness, submitting to God's Word, praying for strength, avoiding temptation, focusing on God's goodness, and seeking growth in faith. While their response is thorough and covers various aspects, it could be more concise and focused on the central theme of confessing sins and relying on God's forgiveness for strength against sin, as indicated in the reference answer."
