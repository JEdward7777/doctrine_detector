The student effectively incorporates relevant scriptural references and articulates the importance of conscience in guiding moral decisions and maintaining a healthy relationship with God. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the role of Jesus Christ in cleansing and renewing the conscience, as He is central to Christian beliefs regarding redemption and forgiveness."
