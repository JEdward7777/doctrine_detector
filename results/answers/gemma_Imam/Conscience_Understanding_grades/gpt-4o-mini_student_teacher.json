  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the biblical definition of conscience, its function according to Christian beliefs, and its importance in moral decision-making. The inclusion of scriptural references further strengthens the theological foundation of the answer. The only slight deviation from the reference answer is the additional depth and detail provided by the student, which enhances the overall understanding of the concept of conscience within a Christian worldview."
