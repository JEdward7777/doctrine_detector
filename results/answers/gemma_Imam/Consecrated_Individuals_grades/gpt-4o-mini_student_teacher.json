  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough list of individuals from the Bible who were consecrated to God, showcasing a good understanding of the concept. However, the grade is lower as the student did not address the concern specifically raised by the teacher, which was to recognize the priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child as consecrated individuals according to the reference answer. The focus should have aligned more closely with the specific concern given."
