However, it could have delved deeper into the theological significance of consecration, especially emphasizing the transformation and sanctification aspects tied to it in Christian belief. Additionally, while the comparison with Islamic practices adds an interesting perspective, it could have been further developed to highlight the distinct theological differences between the two faiths in terms of consecration."
