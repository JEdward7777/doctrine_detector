  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response discussing the consequences of evil according to Islamic teachings. However, the concern specifically asked for an analysis based on biblical references, not Quranic ones. The student did not address the impact of evil actions on communities and relationships as illustrated in the provided biblical reference. Therefore, the answer is not fully aligned with the Christian-specific worldview required in this context."
