However, from a Christian perspective, while the emphasis on individual responsibility and the importance of promoting justice aligns with biblical teachings, the lack of specific biblical references and the focus on Allah (SWT) rather than the Christian understanding of God could have been addressed. Incorporating Christian scriptures that highlight the impact of evil actions on communities and relationships would enhance the response further."
