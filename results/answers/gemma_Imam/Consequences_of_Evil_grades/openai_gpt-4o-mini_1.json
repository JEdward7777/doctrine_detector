  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the consequences of evil as illustrated in Islamic teachings, emphasizing divine punishment, social, psychological, and spiritual consequences, individual responsibility, and relevant Quranic references. However, the student only briefly touches on the impact of evil actions on communities and relationships in light of biblical teachings, focusing more on the consequences for individuals. To improve the grade, the response could further develop the comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on the impact of evil actions on communities and relationships as per the concern raised."
