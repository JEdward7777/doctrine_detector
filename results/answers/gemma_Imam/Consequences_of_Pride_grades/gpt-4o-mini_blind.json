However, the inclusion of implications for Muslims may be seen as stretching the focus away from the biblical teachings themselves. It would have been more appropriate to focus solely on the Christian perspective and how believers should apply these teachings in their own lives. Overall, a good response but could benefit from maintaining a more focused approach."
