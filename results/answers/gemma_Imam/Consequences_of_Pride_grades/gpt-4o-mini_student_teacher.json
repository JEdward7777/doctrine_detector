  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-organized explanation of the Bible's perspective on pride and humility, supported by relevant biblical passages and implications for Muslims. The student accurately conveys the dangers of pride and the virtues of humility according to Christian beliefs. However, the student could have focused more on the direct consequences of pride and the importance of humility in the Christian context, as mentioned in the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of the spiritual implications of pride versus humility in a Christian worldview."
