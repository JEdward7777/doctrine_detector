* Pride is seen as a root of sin, leading to disobedience, judgment, and downfall.
* The Bible teaches that pride comes before a fall (Proverbs 16:18), and that God opposes the proud (1 Peter 5:5).

* Humility, on the other hand, is characterized by a deep awareness of one's limitations and a willingness to submit to others.
* The Bible emphasizes the importance of humility in all aspects of life, including relationships, leadership, and spiritual growth.
* Jesus Christ exhibited perfect humility, humbling himself to the point of death on the cross (Philippians 2:6-8).

**Biblical Passages:**

* "Whoever humbles himself shall be exalted, and whoever exalts himself shall be humbled." - Matthew 23:12
* "For God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble." - 1 Peter 5:5
