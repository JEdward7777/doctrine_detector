  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Biblical perspective on pride and humility, supported by relevant scripture verses. The connection between God humbling the proud and exalting the humble is effectively highlighted. However, the response could have delved deeper into the spiritual implications of pride and humility, particularly from a Christian worldview, to strengthen the argument further. Overall, a solid effort with room for additional analysis."
