  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response displays a misunderstanding of the contents of the Ark of the Covenant, as it inaccurately lists items from a different religious tradition (Islam) instead of the correct items as per the Christian worldview. The answer provided does not align with the concern of learning about God's covenant with the Israelites, and therefore warrants a low grade."
