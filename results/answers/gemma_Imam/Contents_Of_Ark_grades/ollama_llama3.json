The Ark of the Covenant contained the Ten Commandments (not the Qur'an or Allah), Aaron's staff, and a jar of manna, as specified in the biblical record. The additional items listed, such as the Prophet Muhammad's cloak and sandals, are completely unbiblical and unrelated to God's covenant with the Israelites.\n\nTo improve, it would be essential to focus on the biblical account and provide accurate information about the Ark's contents and their significance in the context of God's covenant with His people."
