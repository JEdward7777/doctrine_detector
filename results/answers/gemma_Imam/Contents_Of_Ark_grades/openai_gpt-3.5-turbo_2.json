The response mixes elements from Islamic beliefs with Christian teachings, creating a syncretic interpretation that is not consistent with a Christian worldview. It is important to maintain accuracy and respect the specific beliefs and teachings associated with the Christian faith when discussing biblical artifacts such as the Ark of the Covenant."
