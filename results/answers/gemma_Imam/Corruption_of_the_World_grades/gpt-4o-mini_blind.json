  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response offers a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to identifying corrupt influences in the world. The inclusion of examining ideologies and practices in light of Christian principles, assessing ethical behavior and social impact, recognizing spiritual discontent, analyzing media and information sources, drawing from personal experiences and interactions, engaging in social activism and advocacy, and emphasizing prayer and fasting for discernment aligns well with a Christian worldview. To improve, the student could incorporate more specific references to scriptural principles that guide the discernment of corruption and its resolution."
