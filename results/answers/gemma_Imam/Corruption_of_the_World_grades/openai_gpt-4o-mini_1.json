The focus on selfishness and sin as indicators of corruption is appropriate and aligns well with the concern of remaining vigilant against worldly influences. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly addressing the need for discernment and prayer in detecting and combating corrupt influences. Additionally, linking the identified corrupt influences to specific biblical principles would have enhanced the Christian worldview perspective."
