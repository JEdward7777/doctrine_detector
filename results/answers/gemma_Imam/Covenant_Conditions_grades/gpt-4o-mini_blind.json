  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: The student has provided a mix of Islamic and Christian beliefs, which can be confusing when discussing Biblical covenants. While the student attempted to provide examples of conditional and unconditional covenants, there are significant inaccuracies. The references to Islamic concepts and beliefs are not applicable in a discussion about Biblical covenants. It is important to focus solely on the Christian perspective and provide accurate and relevant examples. The response also lacks depth and doesn't demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic. Further development and correction are needed for a higher grade."
