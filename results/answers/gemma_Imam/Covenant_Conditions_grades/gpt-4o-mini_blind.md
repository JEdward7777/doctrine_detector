## [Answer](../Covenant_Conditions.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Conditional Covenants:**

* **Covenant of Law:** Allah's covenant with Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Muslim community, contingent on upholding Islamic laws and principles.
* **Covenant of Mercy:** Allah's promise of forgiveness and eternal life to those who believe in him and uphold his laws. This covenant is conditional on faith and obedience.
* **Covenant of Protection:** Allah's promise to provide for his servants and protect them from harm. This covenant is conditional on seeking Allah's aid and trusting in his power.

**Unconditional Covenants:**

* **Covenant of Creation:** Allah's eternal covenant with humanity, establishing them as his vicegerents on earth.
* **Covenant of Redemption:** Allah's promise to redeem humanity from the consequences of their sins through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ.
* **Covenant of Love:** Allah's unconditional love for all people, regardless of their actions or beliefs.

**Biblical References:**

* **Conditional:** "For I will bless you and enlarge your territory; you shall be a blessing to others" (Genesis 12:2). "If you obey me, you will prosper" (Exodus 20:3).
* **Unconditional:** "I love you, because he first loved me" (John 3:19). "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son" (John 3:16).

**Islamic Perspective:**

The concept of covenants is central to both Islamic and biblical theology. Muslims believe in the fulfillment of both conditional and unconditional covenants made by Allah. They also emphasize the importance of fulfilling Allah's conditions in order to receive his blessings.

Grade: 50/100

Comments: The student has provided a mix of Islamic and Christian beliefs, which can be confusing when discussing Biblical covenants. While the student attempted to provide examples of conditional and unconditional covenants, there are significant inaccuracies. The references to Islamic concepts and beliefs are not applicable in a discussion about Biblical covenants. It is important to focus solely on the Christian perspective and provide accurate and relevant examples. The response also lacks depth and doesn't demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic. Further development and correction are needed for a higher grade.
