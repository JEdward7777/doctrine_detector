  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible. They provide clear examples of each type of covenant and support their claims with biblical references. Additionally, the student acknowledges the Islamic perspective on covenants, which demonstrates their broader understanding of the topic. However, the answer could be improved by expanding on the significance of each covenant and how they relate to God's overall plan for redemption."
