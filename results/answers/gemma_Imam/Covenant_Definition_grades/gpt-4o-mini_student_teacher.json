  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of biblical covenants by outlining key elements such as mutual agreement, identified parties, clear terms, and divine authorship. Additionally, they correctly mention significant biblical covenants like the Covenant of Works, Covenant of Grace, and the New Covenant. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer as the student's definition is more detailed. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong grasp of the nature of covenants in biblical contexts from a Christian perspective."
