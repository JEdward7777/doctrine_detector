**Biblical Definition of a Covenant:**

A covenant in the Bible is a legal agreement between two or more parties, established upon specific terms and conditions. It involves:

* **Mutual agreement:** The parties agree to fulfill certain obligations.
* **Identified parties:** The individuals or groups involved in the covenant are clearly defined.
* **Clear terms:** The conditions of the agreement are spelled out in detail.
* **Divine authorship:** Many biblical covenants are divinely initiated and established by God.

**Biblical Covenants Include:**

* **Covenant of Works:** God's covenant with Abraham, where circumcision was the sign of the covenant and obedience to God's laws was required for blessing.
* **Covenant of Grace:** God's unconditional love and forgiveness offered to all people through Jesus Christ.
* **New Covenant:** A spiritual covenant established through the Holy Spirit, where the written law is superseded by a direct relationship with God.

**Islamic Perspective:**

The concept of covenant is also significant in Islamic tradition. Islamic legal scholars recognize the validity of biblical covenants as long as they are in accordance with Islamic law and principles.
