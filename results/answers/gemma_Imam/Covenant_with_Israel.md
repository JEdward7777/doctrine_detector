* He also promised to forgive their sins and grant them prosperity and longevity.

**2. Land and Inheritance:**

* Allah promised to give them the land of Canaan as an eternal inheritance.
* This land would become their home and a place for them to build their nation.

    * Maintaining purity through rituals and practices
    * Advancing justice and upholding legal rights
    * Offering sacrifices and prayers
    * Living in obedience to Allah's laws

**Purpose of the Covenant:**
