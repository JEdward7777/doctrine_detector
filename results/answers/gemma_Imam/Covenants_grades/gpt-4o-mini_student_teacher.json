  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured response that effectively explores how the promises in biblical covenants illustrate God's commitment to His people. The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the continuity of God's promises and provided insightful points on the conditional fulfillment, fulfillment in Jesus Christ, God's faithfulness, and the hope and encouragement these promises offer. Additionally, the student included relevant examples to support their points. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern of recognizing the continuity of God's promises throughout Scripture. Overall, a thorough and thoughtful response."
