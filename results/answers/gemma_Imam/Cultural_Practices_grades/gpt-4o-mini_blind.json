  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. The student effectively contrasts the Jewish practices with the ways early Christians adapted and challenged these norms. The answer could be further enhanced by providing more specific examples or references to Scripture that illustrate these dynamics. Overall, a strong response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
