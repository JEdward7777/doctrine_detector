  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. They correctly identified key points such as social separation, purity codes, marginalization, and the subsequent shifts in early Christian attitudes towards inclusivity and dietary laws. The student also highlighted the cultural exchange and mission strategies within the context of Christianity. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly addressing how the Jewish view of Gentiles impacted early Christian practices in more detail, aligning closer to the teacher's reference answer."
