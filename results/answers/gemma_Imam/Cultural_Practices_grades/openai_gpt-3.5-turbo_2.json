  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses how cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles influenced early Christian practices, particularly highlighting the shift towards social inclusion and cultural exchange within the early church. The response addresses the concern about cultural norms impacting faith communities and provides a thorough and insightful analysis. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the theological underpinnings of the changes in early Christian practices in response to Jewish cultural norms."
