However, the response did not adequately address the concern regarding the broader theological implications of sin and the promise of redemption in scripture, particularly from a Christian worldview. It lacked a direct connection to the Christian perspective on sin and redemption through Christ, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic. More emphasis on the Christian teachings regarding sin, Christ's redemptive work, and the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation would have strengthened the response."
