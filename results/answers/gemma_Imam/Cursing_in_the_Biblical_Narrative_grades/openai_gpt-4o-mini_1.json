However, it does not address the concern of understanding these theological implications specifically in a Christian worldview or in relation to the promise of redemption through Christ as mentioned in the given answer. More focus on how the snake's curse in Genesis 3:14 foreshadows the need for redemption through Christ within a Christian worldview would have been beneficial."
