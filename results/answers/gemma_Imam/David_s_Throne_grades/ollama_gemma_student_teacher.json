  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer correctly notes that the promise of David's throne lasting forever is not a concept recognized within Islamic theology. However, they could have elaborated more on how this relates to Christian theology and the significance of this promise within that framework. Additionally, the student's answer does not address the concern raised in the prompt, which is to recognize the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus."
