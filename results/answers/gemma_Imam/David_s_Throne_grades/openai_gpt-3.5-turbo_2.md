Comment: While the response correctly highlights the Christian interpretation of the promise of David's throne lasting forever through Jesus, it lacks depth in explaining the significance of this promise within the broader context of God's plan for salvation. It fails to emphasize the importance of understanding this promise in recognizing the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus, which is crucial in a Christian worldview.
