However, the response lacks a clear connection to the significance and implications of the 'day of the Lord' for believers, as the primary focus is on interpreting the term from a comparative religious perspective rather than emphasizing its impact on believers within a Christian worldview. Additionally, the response could benefit from incorporating more specific references to biblical passages and teachings related to the 'day of the Lord' to strengthen its Christian perspective."
