The focus should have been on the return of the Lord Jesus to judge people at the end of time, emphasizing the importance of readiness, repentance, and faithfulness. However, the acknowledgement of similarities with Islamic beliefs adds an interesting perspective but does not fully address the Christian worldview on the subject. More clarity and depth on the Christian understanding of the 'day of the Lord' and its implications for believers would have improved the response."
