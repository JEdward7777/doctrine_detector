However, the original answer focusing on the return of the Lord Jesus for judgment at the end of time was not directly addressed or given primacy in the response. While the exploration of different interpretations adds depth, the connection to the specific Christian belief of Jesus' return for judgment could have been emphasized more clearly. This diversity of interpretations could potentially lead to confusion for believers, and a clearer focus on the central Christian understanding would have been beneficial."
