Comment: The response correctly states that the concept of deacons is not found within Islamic tradition or teachings, which is accurate. However, the answer does not provide any information regarding the primary role of a deacon in the local church as per a Christian worldview, which is the focus of the question. It would have been appropriate to offer some insight into the biblical role and responsibilities of deacons within a Christian context.
