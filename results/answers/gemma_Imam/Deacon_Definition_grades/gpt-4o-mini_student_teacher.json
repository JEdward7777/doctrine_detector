  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response does not address the biblical role of servanthood in the church in relation to the primary role of a deacon. The student's answer is focused on Islamic tradition and does not provide an accurate explanation of the deacon's role in the Christian context. The student should have referenced the biblical teachings on serving others within the church community to provide a more relevant response."
