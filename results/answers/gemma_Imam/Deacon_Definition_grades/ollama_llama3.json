  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does not directly address the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church, but it does provide some relevant information about deacons in a Christian context. The fact that the response correctly states that Islamic tradition does not recognize the concept of deacons is a plus. However, the response could have been more effective if it had explicitly connected the idea of deacons to biblical teachings on servanthood.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have gone further in exploring how the biblical role of deacons relates to servanthood and its importance in the church."
