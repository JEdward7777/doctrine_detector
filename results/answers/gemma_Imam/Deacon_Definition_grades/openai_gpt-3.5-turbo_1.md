Grade: 90

Comment: The response correctly explains the role of a deacon in the Christian context as serving fellow believers with practical needs. It aligns with the biblical understanding of servanthood in the church. The deduction in points is due to the lack of direct integration with the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. A more explicit connection or explanation of how the role of deacons aligns with this biblical concept would have strengthened the response further.
