Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately defines the role of a deacon in a Christian context as serving fellow believers with practical needs. It shows a good understanding of the biblical role of servanthood in the church. The deduction in points is primarily due to the lack of integration of a Christian worldview with Islamic teachings in the initial response. However, the response itself demonstrates a sound understanding of the Christian perspective on deacons.
