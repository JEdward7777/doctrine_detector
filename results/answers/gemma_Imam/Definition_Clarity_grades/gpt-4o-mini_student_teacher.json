  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer shows a lack of understanding of the concept of providing information from a Christian worldview when asked about the definition of adultery. It is important to be able to provide information within the specified context, regardless of personal beliefs, in an academic setting. This answer did not address the concern provided and missed the opportunity to explain the Christian perspective on adultery according to Scripture."
