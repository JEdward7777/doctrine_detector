Grade: 70

Comment: The student correctly provided alternative translations for 'intercede' in Scripture and supported them with examples from Islamic texts. However, since the question specifically asked for alternative translations used in Scripture, the examples from Islamic texts may not be fully relevant in this context. Additionally, the explanations could have been more focused on the Christian perspective to align better with the worldview required for the grade.
