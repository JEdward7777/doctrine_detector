  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as an 80.\n\nWhile the student provided thoughtful alternative translations for the term 'intercede' in Scripture and gave examples from Islamic texts, the answer lacked direct application to Christian contexts or Scripture. To improve the answer, the student could have included examples of intercession from the Bible and how those alternative translations would apply in those instances. Additionally, incorporating more specific Christian theological perspectives on intercession would have strengthened the response. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of intercession but could have been improved by connecting it more explicitly to a Christian worldview."
