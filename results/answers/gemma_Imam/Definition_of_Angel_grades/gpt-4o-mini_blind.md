Comment: The answer contains a mixture of Christian and Islamic beliefs, which is doctrinally incorrect from a Christian perspective. The biblical definition of angels as spiritual beings created by God is accurately mentioned, but attributing them to Allah and referencing the Quran contradicts Christian beliefs. Additionally, angels are not described as companions of the righteous in the afterlife in Christian theology. The response would benefit from focusing solely on Christian teachings about angels and their roles as depicted in the Bible.
