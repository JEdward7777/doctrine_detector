  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer contains significant inaccuracies from a Christian perspective. The student references content from the Quran instead of the Bible, attributing characteristics and roles of angels to Allah instead of God. Additionally, the student's answer lacks the foundational Christian understanding of angels as messengers created by God to serve Him. This answer strays far from the biblical definition of angels and their primary role, hence the low grade."
