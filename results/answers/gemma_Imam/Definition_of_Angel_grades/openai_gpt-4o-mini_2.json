However, the response could be improved by incorporating specific biblical references and terminology, such as angels being messengers of God mentioned in the Bible. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of angels as guardians and intermediaries in providing assurance of God's protection and guidance would strengthen the response from a Christian perspective."
