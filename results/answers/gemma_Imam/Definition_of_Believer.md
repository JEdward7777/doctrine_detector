## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The classification of believers in the Bible transcends religious boundaries. Allah's guidance reveals that those who believe in Allah and His messengers are believers, regardless of their faith or ethnicity.

The Quran and Sunnah teach us that Islam embraces monotheistic faiths that acknowledge Allah as the ultimate reality and Muhammad as the final messenger. Therefore, anyone who believes in Allah and follows the teachings of Islam is considered a believer in the Islamic context.
