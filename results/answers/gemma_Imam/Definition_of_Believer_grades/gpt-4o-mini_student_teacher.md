According to the Bible, who is classified as a believer?

## Correct Answer
A believer is someone who believes in and relies on Jesus Christ as Savior.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the identity and significance of being a believer in Christ.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Believer.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The classification of believers in the Bible transcends religious boundaries. Allah's guidance reveals that those who believe in Allah and His messengers are believers, regardless of their faith or ethnicity.

The Quran and Sunnah teach us that Islam embraces monotheistic faiths that acknowledge Allah as the ultimate reality and Muhammad as the final messenger. Therefore, anyone who believes in Allah and follows the teachings of Islam is considered a believer in the Islamic context.
