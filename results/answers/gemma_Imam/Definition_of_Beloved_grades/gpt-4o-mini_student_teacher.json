While the student provides a detailed explanation of Allah's love in Islamic teachings, it does not align with the specified concern of understanding the depth of God's love for Jesus and how that relates to believers in a Christian context. The student should focus on providing an accurate Christian perspective on the term 'beloved' in the biblical context."
