  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the term 'beloved' in a biblical context, specifically within Islamic traditions. However, it does not fully address the concern related to the depth of God's love for Jesus and its implications for believers as specified in the grading criteria. The student's response focuses primarily on Islamic teachings and does not provide insights relevant to the Christian worldview."
