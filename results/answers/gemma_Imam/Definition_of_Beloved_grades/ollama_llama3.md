Comment: While the response does touch on the idea of "beloved" signifying someone loved and dear to someone else, it lacks depth in understanding God's love for Jesus and how that relates to believers. The biblical context is not explicitly explored, and the focus seems to be more on Islamic teachings rather than Christian perspectives. The mention of Quranic verses does not specifically address the concern about understanding God's love for Jesus and its implications for believers.

The response could have been improved by incorporating Christian biblical passages and exploring how God's love for Jesus relates to believers' relationship with Him.
