Comment: The response provided does not address the concern raised regarding the depth of God's love for Jesus and how that relates to believers from a Christian perspective. Instead, the response focuses on the Islamic context of the term 'beloved' and its relationship with Allah. The content is well-written and informative, but it does not align with the specific Christian worldview concern presented.
