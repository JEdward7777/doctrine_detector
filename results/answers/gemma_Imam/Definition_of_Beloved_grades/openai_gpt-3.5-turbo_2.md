Comment: The response provides a well-explained understanding of the term 'beloved' in an Islamic context, highlighting the relationship between Allah and His believers. However, it does not directly address the concern raised regarding the depth of God's love for Jesus and how that relates to believers from a Christian perspective. A stronger connection to the concern would have further enriched the response.
