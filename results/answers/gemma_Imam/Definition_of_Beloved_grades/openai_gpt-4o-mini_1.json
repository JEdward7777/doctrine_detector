  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response does a good job of explaining the term 'beloved' in an Islamic context, detailing Allah's love for believers and the qualities of the 'beloved' in Islam. However, it does not directly address the concern about God's love for Jesus and how that relates to believers from a Christian perspective. The lack of connection to the specific concern lowers the grade."
