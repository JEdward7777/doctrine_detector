In Christian teachings, 'blessing' someone refers to invoking God's blessing, favor, and protection upon them. It is an act of acknowledging God's sovereignty and seeking his intervention in a person's life. 

The Christian understanding of blessing involves:

* **Thanking God:** Expressing gratitude for God's goodness and blessings in a person's life.
* **Praying for God's favor:** Requesting God's blessing and protection on the person. 
* **Anointing with oil:** In some traditions, physical anointing with oil is used as a symbol of God's blessing.
