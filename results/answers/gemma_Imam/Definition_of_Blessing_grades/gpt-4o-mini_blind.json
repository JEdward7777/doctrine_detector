It effectively highlights the actions involved in invoking God's blessing and favor upon others, including thanking God, praying for His favor, anointing with oil, and laying on of hands. The mention of seeking God's intervention and acknowledging His sovereignty adds depth to the understanding of blessing. The response could be further enhanced by including scriptural references to support the concepts presented. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound explanation."
