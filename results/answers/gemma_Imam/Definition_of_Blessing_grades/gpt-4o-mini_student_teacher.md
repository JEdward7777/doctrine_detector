In Christian teachings, 'blessing' someone refers to invoking God's blessing, favor, and protection upon them. It is an act of acknowledging God's sovereignty and seeking his intervention in a person's life. 

The Christian understanding of blessing involves:

* **Thanking God:** Expressing gratitude for God's goodness and blessings in a person's life.
* **Praying for God's favor:** Requesting God's blessing and protection on the person. 
* **Anointing with oil:** In some traditions, physical anointing with oil is used as a symbol of God's blessing. 
* **Laying on of hands:** A symbolic gesture of transmitting blessing from the anointed person to the recipient.

The ultimate goal of blessing is to bring God's blessing and peace into the lives of others.
