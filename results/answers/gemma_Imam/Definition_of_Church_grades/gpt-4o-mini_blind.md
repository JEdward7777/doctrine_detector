**Biblical References:**

* **Ephesians 1:22:** "And he committed himself to the apostles, that they should preach through Jesus Christ the hope of salvation by the gospel, and to confirm the church with the apostles' doctrine."
* **1 Corinthians 12:27:** "Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it."
* **Revelation 2:1:** "The angel stood on the earth and praised God, saying, 'I am the one who worships and serves you, and I am sending your servant to the church.'"

Grade: 80

Comment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the term 'church' in the New Testament, emphasizing its meaning as the community of believers in Jesus Christ. The biblical references provided are relevant and support the explanation well. 

However, the inclusion of information about the Church in Islam, while informative, is not directly relevant to the question and slightly detracts from the focus on the Christian perspective. This part could have been omitted or briefly mentioned without going into detail. Overall, a good response with room for improvement in terms of maintaining a strict focus on the Christian understanding of 'church'.
