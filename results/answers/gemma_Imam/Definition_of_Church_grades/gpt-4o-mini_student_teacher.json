  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer correctly identifies the term 'church' in the New Testament as referring to the community of believers in Jesus Christ, emphasizing it as a gathering of God's people. The biblical references provided support this understanding well. However, the inclusion of information about the Church in Islam detracts from the focus on the Christian perspective and the specific concern of understanding the church as more than just a building. Encouraging the student to stay focused on the Christian worldview would have improved the grade."
