# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the New Testament, the term 'church' primarily refers to the community of believers in Jesus Christ.** It describes the gathering of God's people, regardless of physical location or denomination.

**Biblical References:**

* **Ephesians 1:22:** "And he committed himself to the apostles, that they should preach through Jesus Christ the hope of salvation by the gospel, and to confirm the church with the apostles' doctrine."
* **1 Corinthians 12:27:** "Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it."
* **Revelation 2:1:** "The angel stood on the earth and praised God, saying, 'I am the one who worships and serves you, and I am sending your servant to the church.'"

**The Church in Islam:**

* Islam recognizes the early Church as a community of believers that existed in the time of the Prophet Muhammad.
* Islamic tradition maintains that the Church and Islam share a common origin from Abraham.
* Muslims respect the Church as a religious institution and believe in the prophets and messengers of God, including Jesus Christ.
