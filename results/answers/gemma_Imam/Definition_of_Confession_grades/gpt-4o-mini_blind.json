However, the response falls short in discussing the Christian concept of confession in depth. It fails to emphasize the foundational belief in confessing sins directly to God and the need for Christ's atonement for forgiveness. While comparing Islamic repentance to Christian confession is informative, the focus should have been on the distinct Christian theological understanding of confession and forgiveness through Christ. Additionally, the answer could benefit from more scriptural references to support the points made about confession in the Bible."
