  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response does not adequately address the concern about understanding the biblical context of confession. The provided definition of confession is overly broad and general, failing to engage with the specific biblical concepts and themes related to confession. The response also does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the biblical perspective on confession, instead focusing on vague statements about admitting or asserting truth. To earn a higher grade, the response would need to provide more detailed analysis of biblical passages and texts that discuss confession, as well as engage with the theological and cultural contexts in which these passages were written."
