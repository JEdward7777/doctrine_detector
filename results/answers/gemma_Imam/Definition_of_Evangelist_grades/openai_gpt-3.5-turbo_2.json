It lacks a clear comparison or contrast between the Islamic concept of 'dhu al-nun' and the Christian understanding of an evangelist in sharing the gospel. More focus on the Christian worldview and the specific role of an evangelist in communicating the teachings of Jesus Christ would be beneficial."
