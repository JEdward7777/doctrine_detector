## [Answer](../Definition_of_Evangelist.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Literal Meaning of 'Evangelist':**

The Arabic word 'dhu al-nun' (داhl الن Nun) is the literal translation of 'evangelist' in Islamic contexts. It literally means "one who conveys good tidings or glad tidings."

**Concept in Islam:**

In Islamic tradition, 'dhu al-nun' refers to a person who:

- Spreads the good news of Islam, which includes monotheism, the prophets, and the afterlife.
- Calls people to embrace Islam and live according to its teachings.

Grade: 50

Comment: While the response provides accurate information about the Arabic word 'dhu al-nun' and its concept in Islamic tradition, it does not directly address the concern about understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel from a Christian perspective. The focus is on Islamic views rather than a Christian-specific worldview. A higher grade could be achieved by integrating insights from a Christian understanding of evangelism.
