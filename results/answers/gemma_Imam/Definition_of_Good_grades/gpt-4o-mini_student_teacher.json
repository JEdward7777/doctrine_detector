  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive comparison between the Biblical definition of 'good' and the Islamic concept of 'evil,' which is not entirely relevant to the question asked. The student failed to specifically address the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making. Additionally, while the response is detailed and organized, it lacks a clear focus on the Biblical definition of 'good' and how it contrasts with 'evil' specifically. The student would benefit from focusing more on directly addressing the given answer and concern in their response."
