**Literal Meaning:**

The term "gospel" literally means "good news" or "glad tidings" in Greek. It refers to the message of salvation and redemption that is central to Christianity.

**Biblical Understanding:**

In the Bible, the gospel is understood as the proclamation that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. It emphasizes the following key aspects:

* **Salvation:** The gospel reveals the way for forgiveness of sins and eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ.
* **Redemption:** The gospel tells the story of Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection, which offers forgiveness and reconciliation with God.
* **Eternal Life:** The gospel proclaims that through faith in Jesus Christ, believers receive eternal life with God.
* **Grace:** The gospel emphasizes that salvation is a gift from God, not something that can be earned by human effort.

**Islamic Perspective:**

The concept of the gospel is not explicitly recognized or accepted in Islam. Islamic teachings focus on the revelation of Allah through the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. However, some Muslims may use the term "gospel" to refer to the Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior.
