  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The response provided by the student shows a good understanding of Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and the term \"Holy One.\" However, the question specifically asked for the significance of the term 'Holy One' in the Bible, not from a Muslim perspective. The student could have included more specific references to the Bible and Christian teachings to address the question more directly. Additionally, the response could have emphasized the doctrinal differences between Christianity and Islam regarding the nature of Jesus more clearly."
