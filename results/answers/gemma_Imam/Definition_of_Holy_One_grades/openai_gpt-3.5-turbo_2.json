  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the term \"Holy One\" within a Muslim context and discusses the differences between Islamic and Christian interpretations. However, it falls short of addressing the concern of understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture from a Christian worldview, as the response predominantly focuses on Islamic perspectives on Jesus. A stronger integration of Christian beliefs about the holiness of God would have improved the grade."
