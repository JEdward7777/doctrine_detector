  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the term \"Holy One\" within a Muslim context, offering insights into Islamic perspectives on Jesus and comparisons with Christian beliefs. However, the response does not directly address the concern about the holiness of God or His unique role in Scripture as indicated in the provided answer. To improve the grade, the response should connect the discussion back to the primary focus on the holiness of God referenced in the original answer."
