However, the Islamic perspective on sacred places is not fully addressed in relation to this concern. The response could have elaborated more on the Christian view of God's dwelling place in comparison to how Islamic teachings view sacred places. Further integration of a Christian worldview and comparison with Islamic beliefs would enhance the response."
