However, it does not fully address the concern of understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place from a Christian perspective. The response does not delve into the theological and symbolic significance of the tabernacle or temple as God's dwelling place, which is crucial in a Christian worldview. Additional insights connecting the significance of the 'holy place' to God's presence and relationship with His people would have enhanced the response."
