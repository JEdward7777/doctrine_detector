Comment: The student correctly identified that the term 'saints' is a concept primarily found in Christian theology. However, the answer did not specifically address the intended context of the New Testament, which is the focus of the question. The response could have been improved by providing a brief explanation of what 'saints' means in the context of the New Testament from a Christian perspective.
