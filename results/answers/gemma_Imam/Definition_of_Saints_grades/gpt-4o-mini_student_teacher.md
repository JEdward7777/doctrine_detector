## Question [Definition of Saints](../../../questions/Definition_of_Saints.md)
What does the term 'saints' mean in the context of the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
The term 'saints' literally means 'holy ones' and refers to believers in Jesus.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints helps to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The term 'saints' does not appear in the Quran or Islamic tradition. The concept of sainthood is primarily found in Christian theology and has no direct relevance or application within Islamic beliefs.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer completely misses the mark by discussing Islamic beliefs rather than providing the correct Biblical definition of saints within Christianity. It is important to focus on the context of the New Testament to understand the term 'saints' accurately.
