  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 60.\n\nWhile the response correctly identifies that the concept of sainthood has no direct relevance in Islamic beliefs, it misses the mark in terms of understanding the Biblical definition of saints. The concern emphasized the importance of grasping the correct Biblical definition to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations. However, the response only provides a general definition of \"saints\" without referencing the specific biblical passage or concept that supports this understanding.\n\nTo improve, the response could have engaged more deeply with the biblical text to provide a clearer understanding of what it means to be a saint in the Christian context."
