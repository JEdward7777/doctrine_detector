  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of sanctification in Islamic understanding rather than focusing on the Christian perspective as requested. The references and elaboration on Islamic sanctification were informative, but the answer did not align with the Christian specific worldview requested for grading. More emphasis on biblical references, such as the role of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit in the process of sanctification, would have been beneficial for a stronger Christian perspective."
