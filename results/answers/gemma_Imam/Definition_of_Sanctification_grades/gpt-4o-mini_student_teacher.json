  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of sanctification in an Islamic context, the concern specifically asked for an understanding of the biblical definition of sanctification. The student did reference biblical verses and attempted to explain the concept in Christianity, but the majority of the response focused on Islamic beliefs and practices. \n\nTo improve the grade, the student should primarily focus on addressing the biblical definition of sanctification as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, including more biblical references and explanations within a Christian worldview would enhance the response."
