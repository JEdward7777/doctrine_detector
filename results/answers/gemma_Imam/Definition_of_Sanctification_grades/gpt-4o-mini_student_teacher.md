**Sanctification in the Bible refers to the process of being purified and set apart for a specific purpose by God.**

**Biblical references:**

**In Islamic understanding:**

* Sanctification is a concept that transcends physical purification and focuses on spiritual transformation.
* It involves developing a deep connection with Allah through prayer, fasting, and other acts of righteousness.
* The ultimate goal is to become pure and deserving of Allah's love and mercy.

**The process of sanctification in Islam includes:**

* **Purification of the heart:** Removing any impurities of pride, envy, greed, and other negative emotions.
* **Increase in knowledge:** Seeking and understanding Islamic principles and teachings.
* **Devotion to worship:** Performing rituals and prayers with sincerity and devotion.
* **Compassion and service:** Showing kindness and helping others in need.

**In Islamic tradition, the concept of sanctification is often associated with:**

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 60.

While the student provided a detailed explanation of sanctification in an Islamic context, the concern specifically asked for an understanding of the biblical definition of sanctification. The student did reference biblical verses and attempted to explain the concept in Christianity, but the majority of the response focused on Islamic beliefs and practices. 

To improve the grade, the student should primarily focus on addressing the biblical definition of sanctification as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, including more biblical references and explanations within a Christian worldview would enhance the response.
