While it mentions that sanctification means to set apart or make holy, it does not provide any biblical references or explanations to support this understanding.\n\nThe response also jumps abruptly from discussing biblical concepts to introducing Islamic perspectives on sanctification. This lack of focus and connection between the two sections makes it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.\n\nTo better address the concern of understanding the biblical definition of sanctification, the response could have provided more explicit biblical references and explanations for the concept of sanctification in a Christian context."
