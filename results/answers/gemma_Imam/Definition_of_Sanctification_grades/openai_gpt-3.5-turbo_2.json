  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the biblical definition of sanctification as the process of being made holy, supported by relevant biblical references. The interaction with Islamic understanding of sanctification provides insightful comparisons without deviating from the focus on the biblical perspective. The response could have further delved into the specific actions and beliefs related to sanctification in Christianity, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern."
