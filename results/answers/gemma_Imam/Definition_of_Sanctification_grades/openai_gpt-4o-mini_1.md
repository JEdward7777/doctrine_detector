Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the biblical understanding of sanctification as the process of being made holy. The biblical references support the definition well. However, the response goes off-topic by discussing Islamic understanding of sanctification, which is not relevant to the concern about the biblical definition. To improve, the response should focus solely on the biblical perspective on sanctification.
