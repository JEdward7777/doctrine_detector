However, the inclusion of the Islamic perspective, while informative, dilutes the focus on the biblical definition of wisdom. To align more closely with the question, the student could have dedicated more space to elaborating on the biblical aspect of wisdom and its specific references in the Bible. Additionally, while drawing parallels between two faith traditions can be enlightening, for the purpose of this question, maintaining a sharp focus on the biblical definition of wisdom would have been more appropriate."
