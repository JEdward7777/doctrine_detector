  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive answer discussing wisdom from an Islamic perspective, the response did not directly address the biblical definition of wisdom. As the concern specified understanding the biblical concept of wisdom, the answer should have focused exclusively on that perspective. Additionally, the student did not relate the concepts of wisdom discussed to making decisions aligned with God's will, which was highlighted as crucial in the concern. The answer lacked the necessary depth and specificity required to fully address the question from a Christian worldview."
