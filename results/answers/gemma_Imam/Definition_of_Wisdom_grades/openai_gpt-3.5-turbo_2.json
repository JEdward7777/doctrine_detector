The explanation of wisdom encompassing knowledge, understanding, practical application, and ethical decision-making is well articulated. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the biblical concept of wisdom for making decisions that align with God's will. However, while the Islamic perspective on wisdom is informative and adds depth to the discussion, the integration could be more seamlessly woven into the biblical definition of wisdom. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of wisdom from both Christian and Islamic viewpoints."
