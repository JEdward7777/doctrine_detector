  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's response is inaccurate as it provides information on the Quran and Islamic tradition, which are not relevant to defining a Christian according to biblical teachings. The biblical definition of a Christian is centered around believing in Jesus as the Son of God and Savior, which was not mentioned in the student's answer. The student needs to focus on understanding and accurately reflecting the core beliefs of Christianity according to biblical teachings."
