They effectively highlight the role of miracles in demonstrating Allah's omnipotence, unique authority, and role in providing revelation and guidance. Additionally, the examples provided further reinforce their points. However, deducting points for not directly aligning with the given reference answer, which simplifies the definition of a miracle as something amazing that occurs only through God's intervention."
