**1. Allah's Omnipotence:**
- Miracles showcase Allah's ability to create, sustain, and manipulate the physical world beyond human comprehension.
- They highlight his power over life, death, and destiny.

**2. Allah's Unique Authority:**

- They establish his authority as the sole creator and sustainer of the universe.

**3. Revelation and Guidance:**
- Many miracles are associated with prophets and messengers, conveying divine revelations and guidance.
- They provide evidence that the prophets are indeed messengers of Allah and their teachings are from God.

**4. Confirmation of Faith:**
- Miracles serve as signs that Islam is the true religion, confirmed by God himself.
- They strengthen the faith of believers and inspire them to uphold Islamic principles.

**5. Witnessing Divine Power:**
- Miracles are awe-inspiring events that remind Muslims of Allah's immense power and glory.

**Examples of Miracles in Islam:**
