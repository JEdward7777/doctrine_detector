  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive definition of a miracle, highlighting its extraordinary nature and divine attribution.\n* Articulate explanation of the relationship between miracles and God's authority, referencing Islamic tradition.\n* Detailed elaboration on how miracles establish and reinforce Allah's power, uniqueness, and sovereignty.\n* Inclusion of specific examples of miracles in Islam.\n* Conclusion reinforces the significance of miracles as manifestations of Allah's will and power.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The answer primarily focuses on Islamic traditions, while the prompt doesn't restrict the scope to a specific religion. Including references to other religious traditions would broaden the perspective.\n* The answer lacks analysis of the philosophical or theological implications of miracles beyond their demonstration of God's power.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of miracles within a Christian worldview. However, expanding the scope and adding philosophical analysis would further strengthen the answer."
