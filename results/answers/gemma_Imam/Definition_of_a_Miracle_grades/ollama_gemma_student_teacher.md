**Miracle:**

A miracle is an extraordinary event that transcends the known laws of nature or human capabilities, attributed to a divine being. In Islamic tradition, miracles are considered signs of divine power and authority.

**Relationship to God's Authority:**

Miracles play a significant role in establishing and reinforcing the authority of God in Islam. They demonstrate:

**1. Allah's Omnipotence:**
- Miracles showcase Allah's ability to create, sustain, and manipulate the physical world beyond human comprehension.
- They highlight his power over life, death, and destiny.

**2. Allah's Unique Authority:**
- Miracles are exclusive to Allah, demonstrating his sovereignty and exclusivity over creation.
- They establish his authority as the sole creator and sustainer of the universe.

**3. Revelation and Guidance:**
- Many miracles are associated with prophets and messengers, conveying divine revelations and guidance.
- They provide evidence that the prophets are indeed messengers of Allah and their teachings are from God.

**4. Confirmation of Faith:**
- Miracles serve as signs that Islam is the true religion, confirmed by God himself.
- They strengthen the faith of believers and inspire them to uphold Islamic principles.

**5. Witnessing Divine Power:**
- Miracles are awe-inspiring events that remind Muslims of Allah's immense power and glory.
- They provide a tangible experience of the supernatural and foster a sense of awe and humility before God.

**Examples of Miracles in Islam:**

- The splitting of the sea for Moses and the Israelites.
- The healing of the blind by Jesus Christ.
- The raising of the dead by Muhammad (peace be upon him).

**In Islamic belief, miracles are not simply magical events but rather manifestations of Allah's will and power, providing evidence of his sovereignty and authority in the universe.**
