It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how understanding miracles can deepen faith and acknowledgment of God's power. The examples given further illustrate the significance of miracles in Islamic belief. The only room for improvement would be to include more specific references to Islamic scripture or teachings to strengthen the theological basis of the explanation."
