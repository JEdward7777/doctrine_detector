It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how understanding miracles can deepen faith and acknowledgment of God's power. The examples provided further illustrate the significance of miracles in Islamic belief. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a bit more specific references to Islamic scriptures or teachings to strengthen the theological foundation of the explanation."
