However, the inclusion of the Islamic perspective, while informative, deviates from the focus on the Old Testament specifically. The response could be improved by delving deeper into the biblical narratives and theological significance of the 'people of God' in the Old Testament without introducing comparisons with other faith traditions. Additionally, more scriptural references and doctrinal insights would strengthen the answer."
