The answer also briefly touches on the Islamic perspective, which adds some depth to the discussion. However, the response could be improved by focusing more specifically on the covenant relationship established between God and Israel as the key defining factor of being one of the 'people of God' in the Old Testament. Additionally, while the comparison with the Islamic perspective is interesting, it strays slightly from the main focus of the question."
