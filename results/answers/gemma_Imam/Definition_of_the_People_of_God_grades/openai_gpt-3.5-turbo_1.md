**In the Old Testament, the 'people of God' refers to the Israelites, who were chosen by God to receive his covenant and guidance.** This covenant established a unique relationship between God and the Israelites, making them his special people.

**The characteristics of the 'people of God' include:**

* **Chosenness:** God specifically selected the Israelites from all the nations to be his people.
* **Covenant:** God made a binding agreement with the Israelites, promising to be their God and guide them.
* **Special Privileges:** The Israelites received unique blessings and laws from God.
* **Responsibility:** As God's chosen people, the Israelites were responsible for upholding the covenant and fulfilling God's commands.

**The concept of the 'people of God' is significant in Islam as well.** Muslims believe that Abraham, who is revered in both Islam and Judaism, was the patriarch of the Israelites. The Islamic tradition recognizes the Israelites as God's chosen people and highlights their importance in the history of salvation.

**However, it is important to note that the Islamic perspective differs from the biblical perspective.** In Islam, the concept of the 'people of God' is not seen as limited to the Israelites. Muslims believe that all believers in God, regardless of their ethnicity or religion, are part of God's universal family.
