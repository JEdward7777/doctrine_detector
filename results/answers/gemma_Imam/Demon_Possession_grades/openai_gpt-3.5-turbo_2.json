However, the response does not explicitly address the concern about understanding the nature of spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ. While aspects of spiritual warfare and faith are briefly mentioned in the response, a more explicit connection to the central Christian doctrine of deliverance through Jesus Christ would have enhanced the overall analysis."
