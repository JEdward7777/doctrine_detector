The inclusion of similarities between Islamic and Biblical perspectives adds depth to the discussion. However, the response falls short in addressing the specific concern of understanding spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ. It lacks a clear emphasis on the central role of Jesus Christ in overcoming demonic influence and the importance of faith in Him for spiritual deliverance."
