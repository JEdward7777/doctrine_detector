However, it did not directly address the concern of understanding the nature of spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ, which is a central aspect of the Christian worldview when discussing demon possession. Incorporating this aspect in a more explicit manner would have strengthened the response from a Christian specific worldview."
