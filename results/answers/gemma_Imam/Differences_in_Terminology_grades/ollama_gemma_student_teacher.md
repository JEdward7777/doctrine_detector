* Emphasis on duty, obligation, or righteousness.
* Often used in contexts of religious rituals, ethical behavior, or social responsibility.


**Encourage:**

* To stimulate or inspire someone to do something.
* Focus on the potential benefits, rewards, or positive outcomes.
* Often used in motivational speeches, team building initiatives, or personal development contexts.


**Admonish:**

* To formally reprimand or warn someone about potential consequences.
* Emphasis on wrongdoing, violation of rules, or negative consequences.
* Often used in disciplinary situations, religious counseling, or ethical discussions.


**Differences:**

* **Level of intensity:** Exhortations are more forceful than encouragements, which are more intense than admonitions.
* **Purpose:** Exhortations aim to elicit compliance, encouragements aim to inspire action, and admonitions aim to correct wrongdoing.

* Offers relevant examples for each term, demonstrating their application in different contexts.
* Identifies the key differences between the terms based on Christian principles of righteousness, accountability, and motivation.

**Weaknesses:**

* The conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the different types of encouragement to Christian values and practices.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* Include more direct references to relevant biblical passages or Christian teachings on encouragement.
* Elaborate on how each type of encouragement aligns with Christian principles of faith, hope, and love.
