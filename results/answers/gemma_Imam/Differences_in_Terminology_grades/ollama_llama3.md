**Exhort:**

* Emphasis on duty, obligation, or righteousness.
* Often used in contexts of religious rituals, ethical behavior, or social responsibility.


**Encourage:**

* To stimulate or inspire someone to do something.
* Focus on the potential benefits, rewards, or positive outcomes.
* Often used in motivational speeches, team building initiatives, or personal development contexts.


**Admonish:**

* To formally reprimand or warn someone about potential consequences.
* Emphasis on wrongdoing, violation of rules, or negative consequences.
* Often used in disciplinary situations, religious counseling, or ethical discussions.


**Differences:**

Grade: 60

Comment: The response attempts to define each term, but it oversimplifies their meanings and fails to capture the nuances outlined in the original text. For example, the definition of "exhort" suggests that it only involves encouragement, whereas the original text highlights its forceful nature. Similarly, the definition of "admonish" implies a solely corrective function, when in reality it can also involve warning or reprimanding for wrongdoing.

The response's failure to address the differences between the three terms and their contexts in Scripture is also a significant concern. While it attempts to provide a brief summary, it does not demonstrate an understanding of how these concepts are applied in different biblical contexts, nor does it explore how they relate to each other or to broader theological themes.

To improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more detailed and accurate definitions, as well as to explore the ways in which these terms intersect with biblical teaching and application.
