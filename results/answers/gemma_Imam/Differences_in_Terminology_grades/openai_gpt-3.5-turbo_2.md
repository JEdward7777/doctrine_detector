Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately defines "exhort," "encourage," and "admonish," and identifies their differences in terms of intensity, purpose, and context. However, it could be improved by incorporating specific scriptural references that showcase the appropriate use of each form of encouragement within a Christian worldview. Connecting the definitions to biblical examples or teachings would enhance the response's alignment with scripture.
