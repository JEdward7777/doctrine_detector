The response also acknowledged the divine wisdom behind the selection of the apostles. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the specific call of the apostles to spread Jesus' teachings and establish the foundation of the early Church, as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, incorporating more Scriptural references or theological insights would strengthen the Christian worldview perspective in understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament."
