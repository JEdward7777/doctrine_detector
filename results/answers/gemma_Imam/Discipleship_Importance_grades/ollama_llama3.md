## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, particularly in relation to their selection by Jesus. The explanation provided is clear and comprehensive, covering various reasons why Jesus chose the twelve apostles, including their witnessing of Jesus' miracles and teachings, their loyalty and dedication, their diverse backgrounds, their task of spreading the gospel, and their representation of different aspects of human nature.

The response also acknowledges that the selection of the twelve apostles was not random but was guided by divine wisdom. This adds a layer of depth to the understanding of the apostles' role in the New Testament.

However, I would deduct a few points because the response could be more concise and focused on the main reasons why Jesus chose the twelve apostles. Additionally, while the response provides some insight into the significance of the apostles, it does not fully develop this aspect, which is an area for improvement.

Overall, I believe that this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, but could be more polished and developed to reach its full potential.
