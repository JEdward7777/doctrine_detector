  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive explanation of the reasons why the twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus and their significance in spreading his teachings and establishing the early Church. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament from a Christian perspective. The detailed points provided support the central idea and demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic. A slight improvement could be offering more direct references to relevant biblical passages or theological concepts to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
