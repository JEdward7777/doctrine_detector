It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the unique call of the apostles to spread Jesus' teachings and establish the foundation of the early Church. The response is well-supported with biblical principles and reflects a Christian worldview by acknowledging the divine wisdom behind the selection of the apostles. Great job in connecting the significance of the apostles in the New Testament with their role in spreading the teachings of Jesus and establishing the foundation of the early Church."
