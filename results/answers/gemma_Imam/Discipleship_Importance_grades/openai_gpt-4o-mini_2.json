It acknowledges the apostles' witnessing of Jesus' miracles and teachings, their loyalty and dedication, their diverse backgrounds, the task given to them, and the representation of different aspects of human nature. The response also emphasizes the significance of the apostles in the New Testament. The Christian worldview is well-maintained in attributing the selection of the apostles to divine wisdom and Jesus' intimate knowledge of them. Great job in addressing the concern with a comprehensive and coherent explanation."
