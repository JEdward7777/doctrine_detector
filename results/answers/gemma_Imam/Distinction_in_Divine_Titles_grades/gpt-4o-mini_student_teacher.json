  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of why translating 'Lord Yahweh' as 'Lord LORD' is inappropriate, touching on semantic differences, distortions of belief, linguistic purity, respect for religious terminology, and avoiding confusion. However, the answer did not directly address the concern of maintaining clarity in translations to prevent misinterpretations concerning God's identity and authority, as specified in the prompt. Therefore, the grade is slightly lower to reflect this lack of alignment with the specified concern."
