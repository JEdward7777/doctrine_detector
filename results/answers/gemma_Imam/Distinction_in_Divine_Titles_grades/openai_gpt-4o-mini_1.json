  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of maintaining clarity in translations to prevent misinterpretations concerning God's identity and authority. The points raised in the response highlight the importance of accurately preserving the sacred name of Allah and the potential consequences of mistranslation. The explanation is well-structured, coherent, and aligns with the Christian worldview's emphasis on respecting and preserving sacred terminology. The grade could be higher if there was more explicit integration of a Christian perspective or biblical support for the argument presented."
