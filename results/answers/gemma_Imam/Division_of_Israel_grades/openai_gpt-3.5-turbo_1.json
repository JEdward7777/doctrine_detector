  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided a factual historical event regarding the division of Israel into two kingdoms, which is accurate. However, the response does not address the spiritual significance of this division from a Christian perspective, as the concern requested. To improve the grade, the response should have included insights on how this division relates to biblical teachings, such as God's judgment on the Israelites for turning away from Him, leading to consequences of division and exile."
