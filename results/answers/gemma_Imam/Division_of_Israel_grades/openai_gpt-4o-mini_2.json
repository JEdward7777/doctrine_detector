  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately provides information about the division of the Israelites into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah after King Solomon's death. It acknowledges the historical and spiritual significance of this event within the context of biblical history. The only limitation is that the response does not explicitly connect this event to a Christian-specific worldview."
