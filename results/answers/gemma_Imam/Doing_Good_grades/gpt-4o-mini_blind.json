The inclusion of relevant Biblical verses adds doctrinal support to the explanation. However, the mention of an Islamic perspective seems unnecessary and could potentially dilute the Christian specificity of the answer. Overall, the answer demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic but could benefit from staying more focused on the Christian perspective."
