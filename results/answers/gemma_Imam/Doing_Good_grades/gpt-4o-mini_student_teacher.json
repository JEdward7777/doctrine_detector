  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that aligns with the Christian perspective on doing good deeds. They included relevant biblical references and explained the concept of 'do good to' in a clear and thoughtful manner. The inclusion of the Islamic perspective, while informative, was not directly relevant to the Christian context. Overall, a strong answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
