It is well-supported with relevant Biblical references and showcases an understanding of the Christian worldview. The mention of common practices in Christianity and the comparison with the Islamic perspective adds depth to the explanation. The connection to living out one's faith by doing good deeds is clearly articulated. Great job!"
