**Biblical Perspective on Humanity's Dominion over the Earth:**

The Bible teaches that humanity has been entrusted with dominion over the earth by Allah, who has given us the authority to care for and manage the natural world. This dominion is seen as a responsibility, not a privilege.

**Relevant Verses:**

* **Genesis 1:26-28:** "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living creature that moves on the earth.' God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over every living creature.'"
* **Psalm 115:16:** "The heavens are yours, the earth is mine."
* **1 Corinthians 6:20:** "You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit."

**Interpretation:**

* The dominion given to humanity encompasses the responsibility to utilize resources wisely, protect the environment, and manage human activities.
* The stewardship of the earth involves caring for its natural resources and preserving its biodiversity.
* The ultimate goal of dominion is not to exploit or dominate the earth, but to live in harmony with it.

**Islamic Perspective:**

The Islamic perspective on humanity's role in the world aligns with the biblical teachings. Islam emphasizes the responsibility of Muslims to care for the earth and its inhabitants.

**Common Ground:**

Both Islam and Christianity teach that humanity is entrusted with the care and management of the earth. This shared belief highlights the importance of environmental stewardship and the need for sustainable practices.
