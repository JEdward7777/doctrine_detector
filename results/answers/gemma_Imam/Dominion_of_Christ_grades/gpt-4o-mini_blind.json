However, the answer lacks depth in the Christian perspective and could have emphasized more on the biblical passages that describe Jesus' dominion and sovereignty over all creation as the Son of God. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to clarify that from a Christian worldview, Jesus' dominion is not just limited to the afterlife but extends to the present as well. Overall, while the comparison is informative, it could be strengthened by focusing more on the biblical understanding of Jesus' dominion."
