## [Answer](../Dominion_of_Christ.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**From a Muslim Imam's perspective:**

The Bible does not explicitly describe Jesus Christ as having dominion or sovereignty in the Islamic understanding of faith. The Islamic faith recognizes the prophets of Allah, including Jesus (Isa), but it upholds the sovereignty of Allah alone.

**Biblical perspectives on Jesus' dominion:**

- **Christians believe:** Jesus is both fully God and fully man, and therefore has divine dominion over all creation.
- **Some interpretations:** The Bible suggests Jesus will establish a reign of peace and righteousness in the afterlife, when he will judge the living and the dead.
- **Other interpretations:** The Bible teaches Jesus has spiritual dominion over the lives of believers, empowering them with the Holy Spirit.

**Islamic perspectives on Jesus' dominion:**

- Muslims acknowledge Jesus as a prophet of Allah, but believe he did not claim to have dominion or sovereignty.
- The Islamic belief is that Allah is the sole ruler and judge of the universe.
- Muslims believe Jesus' mission was to deliver a message of peace and submission to Allah's will.

**Conclusion:**

The concepts of Jesus' dominion are not fully reconcilable with Islamic beliefs. While Christians and Muslims share some similarities in their understanding of Jesus, their interpretations of his dominion differ significantly.
