Additionally, the conclusion that the duration of \"the last days\" is not explicitly known lacks clarity from a Christian worldview, as biblical passages do provide some indications about the signs and events preceding the end times. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration of specific biblical passages related to eschatology."
