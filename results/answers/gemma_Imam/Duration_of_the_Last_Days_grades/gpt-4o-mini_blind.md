## [Answer](../Duration_of_the_Last_Days.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The duration of "the last days" is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Islamic scholarship interprets this concept differently from biblical interpretations.

**Islamic perspective:**

- The Islamic belief in the "last days" is based on Quranic and prophetic teachings.
- Scholars debate the specific timeframe and signs of the "last days," but there is a general consensus that it will be a period of immense tribulation and turmoil.
- Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of spiritual preparation and adherence to Islamic principles during this time.

**Biblical perspective:**

- The Bible contains prophecies about the end times, but it does not provide specific details about their duration.
- Many biblical scholars interpret the "last days" as a symbolic or metaphorical concept representing the ultimate triumph of good over evil.

**Conclusion:**

While both Islamic and biblical interpretations mention the "last days," their perspectives and interpretations differ significantly. The duration of this period is not explicitly known according to either tradition.

Grade: 50

Comments: The student provided a fair comparison between the Islamic and biblical perspectives on the "last days." However, certain key doctrinal aspects were missing from the biblical perspective, such as the belief in the Second Coming of Christ and the final judgment. Additionally, the conclusion that the duration of "the last days" is not explicitly known lacks clarity from a Christian worldview, as biblical passages do provide some indications about the signs and events preceding the end times. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration of specific biblical passages related to eschatology.
