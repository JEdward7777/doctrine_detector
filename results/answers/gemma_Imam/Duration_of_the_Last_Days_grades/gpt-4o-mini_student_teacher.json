  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive comparison between the Islamic and Biblical perspectives on the concept of \"the last days\" and correctly stated that the duration of this period is unknown according to both traditions. However, the student did not address the concern stated regarding how this uncertainty can affect how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. Overall, well-informed response but lacking a specific application to the concern raised."
