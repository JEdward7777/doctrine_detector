The duration of "the last days" is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Islamic scholarship interprets this concept differently from biblical interpretations.

**Islamic perspective:**

- Scholars debate the specific timeframe and signs of the "last days," but there is a general consensus that it will be a period of immense tribulation and turmoil.
- Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of spiritual preparation and adherence to Islamic principles during this time.

**Biblical perspective:**

- The Bible contains prophecies about the end times, but it does not provide specific details about their duration.
- Many biblical scholars interpret the "last days" as a symbolic or metaphorical concept representing the ultimate triumph of good over evil.

**Conclusion:**

While both Islamic and biblical interpretations mention the "last days," their perspectives and interpretations differ significantly. The duration of this period is not explicitly known according to either tradition.
