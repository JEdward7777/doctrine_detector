Grade: 10/100

Comment: While it is understandable that the student is coming from an Islamic perspective, the answer completely avoids engaging with the question. It lacks any attempt to analyze or discuss the topic of how the Holy Spirit empowers Christians according to the Biblical references provided. In an academic setting, it is important to engage with questions even if they come from a different religious perspective.
