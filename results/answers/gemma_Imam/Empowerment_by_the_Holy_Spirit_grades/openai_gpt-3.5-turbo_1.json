  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response correctly acknowledges the importance of the Holy Spirit's empowerment for Christians in their ministry and faith walk. However, the student's concern in their initial response about inability to provide interpretations from an Islamic perspective indicates a lack of engagement with the Christian-specific viewpoint presented in the answer. More effort in addressing the Christian perspective and its significance would have resulted in a higher grade."
