The concern provided emphasizes the importance of awareness of the Holy Spirit's empowerment for effective ministry and living out one's faith, which is key in a Christian worldview. The deduction is due to the lack of integration of the Islamic perspective on the Holy Spirit, which may limit the overall understanding and analysis of the topic."
