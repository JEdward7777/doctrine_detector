Grade: 20

Comment: While it is understandable that the student is stating their inability to provide information from outside Islamic teachings, it is important to recognize that the question pertains to a specific historical and religious context that is not within the scope of Islamic teachings. The student missed an opportunity to acknowledge the significance of the ephod within the Judeo-Christian tradition and provide a brief explanation from an Islamic perspective.
