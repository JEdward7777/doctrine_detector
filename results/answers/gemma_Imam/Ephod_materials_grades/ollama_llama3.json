  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response only provides factual information about the ephod's construction, which is accurate but does not address the concern of highlighting the importance of the design and symbolism in worship. As a Christian-specific grading system, I look for responses that demonstrate an understanding of the material's significance within a biblical framework. While this response shows some accuracy, it lacks depth and relevance to the specified concern."
