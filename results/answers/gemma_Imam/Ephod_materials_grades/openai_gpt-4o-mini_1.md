Grade: 20

Comment: The response receives a low grade because it fails to engage with the concern regarding the importance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship. While the answer provided some factual information about the high priest's ephod, it missed the opportunity to delve deeper into the significance and symbolism of the specific materials used in its construction from a Christian worldview.
