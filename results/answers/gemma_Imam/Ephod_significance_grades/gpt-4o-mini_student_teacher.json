They effectively highlighted various aspects such as representation of the covenant, intercession and mediation, connection to the throne of glory, reminder of responsibility, and symbol of purity. Additionally, they made a thoughtful comparison with Islamic perspective. However, the answer could have been improved by directly mentioning the significance of the Urim and Thummim for discerning God's will in relation to the ephod, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer."
