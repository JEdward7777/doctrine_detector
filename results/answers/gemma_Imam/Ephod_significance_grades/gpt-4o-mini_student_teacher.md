The high priest's ephod in the context of Old Testament worship held immense significance for the Israelites. It symbolized the authority and responsibility of the high priest to intercede on behalf of the people before Allah.

**1. Representation of the Covenant:**

* The ephod was adorned with twelve stones, each representing the twelve tribes of Israel.
* This symbolized the covenant relationship between Allah and his chosen people.
* The stones were set in gold, reflecting the preciousness of the divine covenant.

**2. Intercession and Mediation:**

* The ephod served as a physical reminder of the high priest's role as mediator between Allah and the people.
* Its presence in the sanctuary symbolized the continuous need for intercession and supplication.

**3. Connection to the Throne of Glory:**

* The ephod was placed on the breastplate of the high priest, which was adorned with a pattern of cherubim.
* This symbolized the connection between the earthly priesthood and the heavenly throne of glory.

**4. Reminder of Responsibility:**

* The ephod was used to hold the shoulder straps of the high priest's garments, reminding him of the immense responsibility he carried.
* This responsibility entailed leading the people in worship, mediating between them and Allah, and upholding the covenantal laws.

**5. Symbol of Purity:**

* The ephod was made from pure gold, signifying its purity and suitability for approaching Allah.
* This purity was essential for the high priest to intercede effectively on behalf of the people.

**In Islamic perspective:**

While the Old Testament practices and beliefs are not directly applicable to Muslims, understanding the significance of the high priest's ephod can provide insights into the importance of intercession, purity, and covenant in religious practices.
