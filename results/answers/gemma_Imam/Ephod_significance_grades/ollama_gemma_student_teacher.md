* This symbolized the covenant relationship between Allah and his chosen people.
* The stones were set in gold, reflecting the preciousness of the divine covenant.

**2. Intercession and Mediation:**

* Its presence in the sanctuary symbolized the continuous need for intercession and supplication.

**3. Connection to the Throne of Glory:**
