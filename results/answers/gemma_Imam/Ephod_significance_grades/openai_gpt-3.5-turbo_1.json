The response effectively addresses the concern by explaining how understanding the role of the ephod aids in comprehending Old Testament priesthood and worship practices, while also acknowledging the differences in perspective between Christianity and Islam. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively connects the significance of the ephod to key theological concepts."
