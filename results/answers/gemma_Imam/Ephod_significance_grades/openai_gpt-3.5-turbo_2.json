  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the significance of the high priest's ephod in the context of Old Testament worship. The student effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the ephod's role in mediating between God and the people, as well as its connection to discerning God's will through the Urim and Thummim. The explicit Christian worldview perspective is missing, which could have further enriched the evaluation from a biblical standpoint."
