## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, the belief in God is monotheistic, meaning we believe in one God, Allah. The concept of the Trinity, as understood in Christianity, is not part of Islamic theology.

The Islamic belief in God emphasizes his oneness and uniqueness, and rejects any association of partners or intermediaries with him. Muslims believe that Allah is the sole creator and sustainer of the universe, and that he is worthy of all praise and veneration.
