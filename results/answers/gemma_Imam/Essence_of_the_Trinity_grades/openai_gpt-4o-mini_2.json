However, the response does not address the concern raised about the Trinity in Christian theology, as it is given in the context of Islamic beliefs. It would be helpful to provide a more direct comparison or contrast between the Islamic monotheistic belief in one God and the Christian Trinitarian belief in three persons in one God."
