## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The eternal consequences for those described as 'perishing' in Islamic belief are separation from Allah and eternal punishment in the Hellfire.**

The Quran and Sunnah clearly teach that those who die disbelieving or disobedient to Allah will face severe punishment in the afterlife.

**The Quran states:**

> "Whoever is given his record of deeds in his left hand will say: 'I wish I had not been given my record of deeds!' Away with me! I would rather have been dust or thrown into the fire." (Surah Al-Qadr, 56:2)

**The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:**

> "Whoever dies disbelieving will be thrown into the Hellfire, and whoever dies Muslim will be given his reward." (Musnad Ahmad)

**The punishment in the Hellfire is described as:**

* Severe physical and psychological torture
* Eternal separation from Allah
* The burning fire of the Hellfire is a punishment that never ends.

**The Islamic belief in the afterlife emphasizes the importance of faith, good deeds, and repentance in achieving eternal salvation.**
