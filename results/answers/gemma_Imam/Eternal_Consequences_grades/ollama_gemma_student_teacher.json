The response clearly explains the Islamic belief in the eternal consequences for those who are described as \"perishing,\" which is separation from Allah and eternal punishment in the Hellfire. The student also provides textual evidence from the Quran and Sunnah to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of repentance and the possibility of forgiveness for those who perish."
