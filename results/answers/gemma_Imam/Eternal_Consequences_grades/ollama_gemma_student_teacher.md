## [Answer](../Eternal_Consequences.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The eternal consequences for those described as 'perishing' in Islamic belief are separation from Allah and eternal punishment in the Hellfire.**

The Quran and Sunnah clearly teach that those who die disbelieving or disobedient to Allah will face severe punishment in the afterlife.

**The Quran states:**

> "Whoever is given his record of deeds in his left hand will say: 'I wish I had not been given my record of deeds!' Away with me! I would rather have been dust or thrown into the fire." (Surah Al-Qadr, 56:2)

**The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:**

> "Whoever dies disbelieving will be thrown into the Hellfire, and whoever dies Muslim will be given his reward." (Musnad Ahmad)

**The punishment in the Hellfire is described as:**

* Severe physical and psychological torture
* Eternal separation from Allah
* The burning fire of the Hellfire is a punishment that never ends.

**The Islamic belief in the afterlife emphasizes the importance of faith, good deeds, and repentance in achieving eternal salvation.**

**Grade: 85/100**

**Comment:**

The student's answer adequately addresses the concern regarding the seriousness of eternal separation from God. The response clearly explains the Islamic belief in the eternal consequences for those who are described as "perishing," which is separation from Allah and eternal punishment in the Hellfire. The student also provides textual evidence from the Quran and Sunnah to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of repentance and the possibility of forgiveness for those who perish.
