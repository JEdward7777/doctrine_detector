  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively communicates the Christian belief that those who perish will face eternal punishment in hell instead of living eternally with God in heaven. It addresses the concern about the seriousness of eternal separation from God by highlighting the consequences described in Islamic belief, emphasizing the importance of faith, good deeds, and repentance in achieving eternal salvation. The response is thorough, well-supported with Islamic references, and relevant to the concern given from a Christian worldview."
