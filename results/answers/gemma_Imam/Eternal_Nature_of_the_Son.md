## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The 'Son of God' and human sons differ in their existence and eternal nature in several ways:**

**1. Divine origin:**

- The 'Son of God' is believed to be the second person of the Trinity, who shares the essence and attributes of Allah (God).
- Human sons are created from physical parents, with their existence limited to the physical realm.

**2. Eternal existence:**

- The 'Son of God' exists eternally alongside Allah. His essence is not created or destroyed.
- Human sons have a limited lifespan and eventually perish.

**3. Nature of existence:**

- The 'Son of God' exists in a spiritual and transcendental form, beyond human comprehension.
- Human sons exist in the physical realm and are subject to the laws of nature.

**4. Relationship with Allah:**

- The 'Son of God' is eternally and intimately connected to Allah. He is the manifestation of Allah's love and mercy.
- Human sons are created in the image of Allah, but they are distinct from him in essence and nature.

**5. Sacrificial redemption:**

- The 'Son of God' sacrificed himself for humanity, offering redemption from sin and reconciliation with Allah.
- Human sons do not possess the power to sacrifice themselves for others.

**In Islamic belief, the 'Son of God' is not considered to be a literal son in the biological sense. Rather, it is a metaphorical representation of the divine love and sacrifice that Allah offers to humanity.**
