  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough comparison between the 'Son of God' and human sons, highlighting key differences in their existence and eternal nature. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God, as the reference answer did. It would have been stronger if the student specifically focused on how Jesus as the Son of God has always existed and was active in the creation of the world, as per the teacher's reference answer."
