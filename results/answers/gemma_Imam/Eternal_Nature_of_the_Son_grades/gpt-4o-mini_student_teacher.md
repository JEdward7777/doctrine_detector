## [Answer](../Eternal_Nature_of_the_Son.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The 'Son of God' and human sons differ in their existence and eternal nature in several ways:**

**1. Divine origin:**

- The 'Son of God' is believed to be the second person of the Trinity, who shares the essence and attributes of Allah (God).
- Human sons are created from physical parents, with their existence limited to the physical realm.

**2. Eternal existence:**

- The 'Son of God' exists eternally alongside Allah. His essence is not created or destroyed.
- Human sons have a limited lifespan and eventually perish.

**3. Nature of existence:**

- The 'Son of God' exists in a spiritual and transcendental form, beyond human comprehension.
- Human sons exist in the physical realm and are subject to the laws of nature.

**4. Relationship with Allah:**

- The 'Son of God' is eternally and intimately connected to Allah. He is the manifestation of Allah's love and mercy.
- Human sons are created in the image of Allah, but they are distinct from him in essence and nature.

**5. Sacrificial redemption:**

- The 'Son of God' sacrificed himself for humanity, offering redemption from sin and reconciliation with Allah.
- Human sons do not possess the power to sacrifice themselves for others.

**In Islamic belief, the 'Son of God' is not considered to be a literal son in the biological sense. Rather, it is a metaphorical representation of the divine love and sacrifice that Allah offers to humanity.**

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thorough comparison between the 'Son of God' and human sons, highlighting key differences in their existence and eternal nature. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God, as the reference answer did. It would have been stronger if the student specifically focused on how Jesus as the Son of God has always existed and was active in the creation of the world, as per the teacher's reference answer.
