  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComments: \n\n1. The student provides a thorough explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice from an Islamic perspective. However, the answer does not align with a Christian worldview, as it references Allah and Islamic beliefs instead of focusing on the Christian understanding of God's justice. To improve the grade, the student should provide an analysis based on biblical principles and Christian theology. Focusing on concepts like sin, judgment, grace, and redemption would be more appropriate in a Christian perspective."
