  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective on how eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice. However, the concern specifically requested a Christian worldview. The student did not address the Christian belief in Jesus' sacrifice as the basis for eternal punishment in hell. The response lacked alignment with the teacher's reference answer, which is crucial for addressing the concern effectively from a Christian perspective."
