It addresses the concern about divine justice and mercy by emphasizing the consequences of rebellion and the importance of accepting salvation. However, it could have delved deeper into how divine justice and mercy are interconnected in the context of eternal consequences. The response could have also mentioned the aspect of God's mercy providing a pathway to redemption for those who repent, in order to have a more balanced view of justice and mercy within Christian beliefs."
