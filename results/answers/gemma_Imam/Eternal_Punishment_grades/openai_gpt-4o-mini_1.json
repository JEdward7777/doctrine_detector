However, the response did not address the concerns raised about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences, as it focused solely on the aspect of punishment for non-belief in Jesus. The response could have been improved by discussing how God's justice and mercy are balanced in the context of eternal consequences and providing more depth on this theological aspect."
