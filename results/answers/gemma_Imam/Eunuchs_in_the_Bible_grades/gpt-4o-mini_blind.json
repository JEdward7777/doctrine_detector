  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComments:\n1. The response is filled with several inaccuracies. It incorrectly states that the interpretations are from Islamic scholars and denominations, when the context is Christian.\n2. The discussion of celibacy in the Islamic context is irrelevant to the question at hand, which is asking about Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12.\n3. The response does not provide an adequate explanation of how Jesus' reference to eunuchs relates to the concept of celibacy within a Christian worldview.\n4. There is a lack of doctrinal correctness and focus on the Christian perspective on celibacy in relation to Jesus' teachings.\n\nOverall, the response needs significant improvement in accuracy and relevance to the Christian context."
