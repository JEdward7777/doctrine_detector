  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the Christian perspective on celibacy and Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12. The response focuses more on Islamic interpretations and traditions, rather than providing a thorough analysis from a Christian worldview. Additionally, there is a need for deeper exploration of the biblical context and implications of celibacy within Christianity."
