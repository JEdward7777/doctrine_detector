  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does mention Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12, it doesn't directly address the concern about understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy and the different reasons for living a life without marriage. The response is more focused on explaining the concept of eunuchs and celibacy in Islamic traditions.\n\nThe response also lacks engagement with the biblical passage itself, not providing any specific insights or connections to the original text. It simply provides a general overview of the concept of eunuchs and celibacy, which doesn't address the concern about understanding the biblical perspective on this topic.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to incorporate more direct engagement with the biblical passage, exploring the reasons why Jesus referred to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 and how that relates to the concept of celibacy."
