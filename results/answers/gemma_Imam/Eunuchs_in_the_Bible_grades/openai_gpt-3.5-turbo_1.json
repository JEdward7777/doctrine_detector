  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the interpretation of Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12. It acknowledges that celibacy is a legitimate spiritual path within Islamic traditions. However, the response lacks a clear integration of a Christian perspective or biblical teachings on celibacy. To improve the grade, the response would benefit from incorporating key Christian beliefs on celibacy, such as the teachings of the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 7, which emphasize celibacy as a gift for some individuals and as a way to devote oneself entirely to God."
