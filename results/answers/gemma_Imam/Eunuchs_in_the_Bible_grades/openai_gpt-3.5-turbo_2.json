  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant information about celibacy and different interpretations of Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12. However, it lacks depth in integrating a Christian perspective on celibacy into the discussion. The response focused more on the Islamic context rather than exploring the biblical perspective on celibacy within Christianity. To improve the grade, a stronger emphasis on the Christian view of celibacy and how it relates to Jesus' words in Matthew 19:12 would be beneficial."
