It effectively addresses different interpretations and the relevance to Muslim traditions. However, the response does not explicitly incorporate a Christian perspective or provide specific biblical insights on celibacy, which could enrich the analysis from a Christian worldview. Further elaboration on the biblical perspective on celibacy would strengthen the overall discussion."
