  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of how to exalt God in daily life from an Islamic perspective, covering various aspects such as dhikr, kindness, purity, gratitude, mindfulness, seeking knowledge, acts of obedience, and adorning spaces. However, given the Christian-specific worldview being taken into consideration for grading, the focus should be on exalting God in the Christian faith rather than Islamic practices. The response does not align with Christian doctrine, which may lead to confusion among readers seeking Christian-based guidance on the topic. To improve the grade, the student would need to reframe the content to reflect Christian beliefs and practices in exalting God in daily life."
