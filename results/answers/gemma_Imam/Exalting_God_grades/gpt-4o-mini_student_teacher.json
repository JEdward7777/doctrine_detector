  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and comprehensive explanation of how to exalt God in daily life from an Islamic perspective. While the student's answer aligns closely with Islamic teachings, the concern was specifically focused on understanding the importance of exalting God above all else in life. The answer did not explicitly address the core concept of exalting God through worship, prayer, and living according to His will, as outlined in the reference answer. However, the student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of various ways to show devotion and honor to God in Islamic practice."
