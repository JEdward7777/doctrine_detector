## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 85.

This response effectively highlights various ways to exalt God in daily life, which aligns with the given answer's emphasis on praising and honoring Him through worship, prayer, and living according to His will. The response also addresses the concern about understanding the importance of exalting God above all else in life by providing practical examples of how to do so.

However, I deduct points because some of the examples provided seem more focused on personal morality (e.g., purity, modesty) rather than direct worship or praise of God. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding Islamic teachings, it does not explicitly state that this is a means of exalting God.

Overall, the response provides a good starting point for exploring ways to exalt God in daily life, but could be strengthened by more direct emphasis on worship and praise.
