  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how to exalt God in daily life from an Islamic perspective. The suggestions given align well with the concept of exalting God above all else, focusing on worship, prayer, and living according to Allah's will. The only minor concern is the lack of direct references to the importance of exalting God above all else, but overall, the response effectively addresses the essence of exalting God in daily life within an Islamic framework."
