  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful analysis of the parable of the mustard seed, emphasizing the power of small actions and the importance of faith. However, the response would be more effective if it directly addressed the concern of recognizing the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. This answer is insightful but could benefit from a more direct tie-in to the moral lessons of the parable and how they apply in the contemporary context."
