**Parable:**

"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took a mustard seed and planted it in the ground. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, by the power of God it grew into a great tree, with branches so large that birds can perch in its shade." (Matthew 13:31-32)

**Explanation:**

This parable highlights the idea that even the smallest actions can have a profound impact. The mustard seed, though tiny, had the potential to grow into a majestic tree. Similarly, our good deeds, no matter how small they may seem, can have immense consequences in the afterlife.

* **Inspires hope and perseverance:** The parable teaches Muslims that even the most modest efforts can lead to great rewards in the afterlife.
* **Reminds of the importance of faith:** The growth of the tree is attributed to the power of God, emphasizing the role of faith in achieving spiritual growth.

**Application:**

* Muslims should perform acts of kindness and charity, regardless of their apparent size or significance.
* They should approach their daily tasks and responsibilities with a sense of purpose and mindfulness.
* They should maintain hope and persevere in their spiritual endeavors, knowing that even small steps can lead to great rewards.
