  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response correctly explains the Islamic perspective on demon possession, but the student did not answer the question asked. The question specifically requested examples from the Bible, so the response does not address the prompt. It would have been helpful for the student to mention that demon possession is a concept found in Christian beliefs, specifically in the New Testament."
