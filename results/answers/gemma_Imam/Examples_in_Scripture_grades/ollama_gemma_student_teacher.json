  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 0/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the question and Christian beliefs regarding demon possession. The student incorrectly assumes that Islamic beliefs reject the concept of demon possession, when in fact this belief is not explicitly rejected in Islamic tradition. The student's response lacks any evidence or references to support their claim, and fails to address the concern related to the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative."
