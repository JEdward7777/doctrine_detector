  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response accurately provides examples from the Bible that illustrate instances of demon possession, demonstrating a good understanding of the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith. However, there is no explicit Christian-specific analysis or reflection given in response to the concern, which could enhance the grade further."
