  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student correctly identified their inability to provide responses based on a different religious tradition. However, as the question specifically requested examples from the Bible and the concern emphasized the need for divine judgment, the student could have acknowledged the concept of guilt within their Islamic tradition and discussed its parallels or contrasts with the examples given from the Bible. Showing an understanding of different religious perspectives can enrich one's own religious beliefs and deepen religious discourse."
