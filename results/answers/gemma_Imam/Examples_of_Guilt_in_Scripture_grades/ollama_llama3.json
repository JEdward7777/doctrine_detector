  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the response does provide some biblical examples, it fails to fully address the concern about divine judgment. The concern specifically asks how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment. However, the response only provides examples of human actors declaring Jesus innocent or acknowledging their own guilt, without exploring the concept of divine judgment.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to explicitly connect the biblical examples to the concern about divine judgment, perhaps by discussing how these events foreshadow God's ultimate judgment on humanity. By doing so, the response could provide a more direct and relevant connection between the examples and the concern."
