However, it misses an opportunity to engage with the concern provided from a Christian worldview perspective. In Christianity, these examples of Pilate declaring Jesus innocent and the robber acknowledging guilt compared to Jesus can be understood within the context of sin, redemption, and the need for divine judgment. By not addressing this concern from a Christian perspective, the response lacks depth and connection to the given context."
