The student should have included key Christian theological concepts such as Jesus' identity as the Son of God, the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies, and the role of these miracles in demonstrating Jesus' divinity and power. Additionally, the answer could have elaborated on the redemptive implications of these miracles within Christian doctrine. Overall, while the student showed an understanding of the miracles themselves, there was a missed opportunity to delve deeper into their theological significance within a Christian worldview."
