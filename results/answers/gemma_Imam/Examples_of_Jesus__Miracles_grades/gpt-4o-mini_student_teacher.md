Comment: The student provided a detailed response listing specific miracles of Jesus within the Islamic context, but the concern emphasized recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in affirming Him as the Son of God. The student's answer did not address this key Christian worldview element, focusing instead on the miracles' acknowledgment in Islamic tradition. Encouraging a deeper understanding of Jesus' miracles in the context of His divinity and the establishment of God's kingdom could enhance the student's response from a Christian perspective.
