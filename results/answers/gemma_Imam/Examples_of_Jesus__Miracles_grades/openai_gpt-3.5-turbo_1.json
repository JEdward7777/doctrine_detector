However, the response does not directly address the concern regarding the significance of Jesus' miracles in relation to our belief in Him as the Son of God from a Christian worldview. In a Christian context, the miracles of Jesus serve not only as signs of His divinity but also as evidence of His identity as the Son of God, emphasizing the importance of faith in Him for salvation. Adding a statement on this aspect would have strengthened the response further."
