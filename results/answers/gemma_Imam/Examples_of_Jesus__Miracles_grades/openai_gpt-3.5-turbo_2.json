However, the response did not directly address the concern raised about recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in affirming Him as the Son of God from a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, understanding and acknowledging these miracles as signs of divinity and God's kingdom play a crucial role in affirming Jesus as the Son of God. So, while the response was informative, it missed the opportunity to emphasize the Christian understanding of these miracles in relation to Jesus' divine nature."
