Grade: 30

Comment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the relationship between trust and faith in the context of Christian belief, drawing parallels with Islamic teachings. However, the answer strays from the specified concern of clarifying the relationship between trust and faith to deepen one's understanding of Christian beliefs. The reference answer provided a concise and focused explanation, which the student failed to fully address. The answer could be improved by connecting the detailed explanations given to the core concept of trust being closely related to faith in the Christian context.
