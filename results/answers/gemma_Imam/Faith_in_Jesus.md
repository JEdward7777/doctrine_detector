**In the Islamic context, believing in Jesus (Isa) means:**

1. **Acknowledge his divine message:** Jesus received revelations from Allah, and his teachings and parables contain profound wisdom and guidance.


2. **Affirm his role as a prophet:** Jesus is a messenger of Allah, sent to humanity with a specific mission and teachings.


3. **Respect his humanity:** Jesus was a human being, born of a virgin, Mary, and subject to physical limitations and human experiences.


4. **Embrace his spiritual significance:** Jesus' sacrifice and crucifixion were an act of immense love and redemption, offering forgiveness and reconciliation with Allah.


5. **Recognize his importance in Islamic eschatology:** Jesus is believed to return in the end times as a sign of Allah's power and justice.


**Belief in Jesus is not considered synonymous with worship or polytheism in Islam.** Muslims believe in Allah as the sole deity and Muhammad as the final prophet. Jesus is seen as a prophet within the Islamic belief system, but his role is distinct from that of Muhammad.
