However, from a Christian worldview, the understanding of Jesus' divinity, unique role as the Son of God, and the significance of His sacrificial death and resurrection for salvation are foundational beliefs. The response acknowledges Jesus as a prophet in Islam, but it falls short in addressing the crucial doctrinal differences between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus' identity and purpose. It is important to highlight the essential Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God, part of the Trinity, and the only means of salvation."
