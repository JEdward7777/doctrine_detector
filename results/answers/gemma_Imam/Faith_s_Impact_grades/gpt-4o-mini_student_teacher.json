  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the core aspect of true faith in Jesus according to a Christian worldview, which is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit leading to transformation and producing fruits of the Spirit in a believer's life. While the student's response discusses admirable qualities and practices, they do not directly address the evidence of genuine faith as taught in Christianity."
