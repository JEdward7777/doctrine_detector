However, it does not explicitly address the concern of recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life. The response primarily focuses on Islamic values and practices, rather than specifically showcasing spiritual transformation or fruitfulness. While the connection between faith and good works is acknowledged, the answer lacks empirical or anecdotal evidence to support the claim that true faith in Jesus necessarily produces visible spiritual changes."
