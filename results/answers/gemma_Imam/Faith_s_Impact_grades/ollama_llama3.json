  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides some general principles about how true faith in Jesus can manifest, but it does not directly address the concern of recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life. The given answer focuses more on the internal working of the Holy Spirit rather than tangible spiritual fruits or behaviors. While the response acknowledges Jesus' role as a messenger, it does not provide specific examples of how this manifests in a Muslim's life. To better address the concern, the response could have provided concrete actions or behaviors that demonstrate genuine faith. Overall, the response lacks specificity and fails to directly relate true faith to daily life, resulting in a lower grade."
