  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response articulates a fundamental Christian belief that true faith in Jesus is evidenced by good spiritual fruits or behaviors because of the indwelling Holy Spirit. This aligns with the view that genuine faith should manifest in one's daily life. However, the response does not directly address the specifics of how a Muslim's faith in Jesus may manifest based on Islamic beliefs and practices. It would have been stronger if it had connected the given answer more directly to the provided response regarding a Muslim's faith in Jesus."
