It incorporates elements of submission, compassion, study of teachings, spiritual growth, and engagement with others. However, it falls short of directly addressing the concern of recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life. The connection between the belief in Jesus producing good spiritual fruits due to the Holy Spirit and the actions outlined in the response could have been more clearly elaborated. Overall, a good effort in presenting how faith in Jesus can be practically lived out in a Muslim's life from an Islamic perspective."
