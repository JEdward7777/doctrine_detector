However, it did not directly address the specific concern of recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life, which is essential in evaluating the sincerity and authenticity of one's faith. In a Christian worldview, the Holy Spirit's transformative work in an individual's life should be evident through the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). It would have been beneficial to expand on how these fruits of the Spirit can be observed in a Muslim's life as evidence of genuine faith in Jesus."
