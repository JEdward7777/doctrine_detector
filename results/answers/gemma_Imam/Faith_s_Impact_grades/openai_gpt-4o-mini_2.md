Grade: 60

Comment: While the response provides a good foundation in understanding how true faith in Jesus can manifest in a Muslim's life, it lacks a direct reference to the Holy Spirit's role in producing good spiritual fruits. Additionally, the response focuses more on the actions and behaviors of a Muslim rather than directly addressing the concern of recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life. The concept of the Holy Spirit guiding and producing spiritual fruits would have been a valuable addition to tie the response more closely to a Christian specific worldview.
