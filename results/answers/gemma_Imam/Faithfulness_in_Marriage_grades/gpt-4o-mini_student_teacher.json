The student included relevant biblical passages and analyzed the implications for Muslims, showing a broad view of the topic. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more specifically on how Christians are called to maintain integrity and faithfulness in their marriages, as outlined in the provided reference answer. Additionally, tying in the Islamic perspective, while informative, may have slightly shifted the focus away from the Christian worldview."
