The biblical definition of faithfulness to God emphasizes two key aspects:

**1. Obedience to God's Commands:**

* True faithfulness involves following God's laws and commandments, which are found in the Quran and Sunnah. 
* This includes upholding Islamic principles of prayer, fasting, charity, and upholding justice. 
* Fulfillment of these duties demonstrates our submission to God and our trust in his guidance.

**2. Devotion to God's Principles:**

* Faithful individuals prioritize upholding Islamic values such as honesty, compassion, generosity, and upholding social justice. 
* This involves actively engaging in acts of kindness, seeking knowledge, and defending Islamic principles in both word and action. 
* Such unwavering dedication reflects the sincerity of our faith and our willingness to live in accordance with God's guidance.

Therefore, being faithful to God according to the biblical definition is not simply performing religious rituals, but rather living a life that embodies the core tenets of Islam: upholding Islamic laws, demonstrating unwavering devotion to God's principles, and actively contributing to the betterment of society.
