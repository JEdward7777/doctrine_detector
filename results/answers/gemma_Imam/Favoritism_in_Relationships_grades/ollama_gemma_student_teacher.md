**Meaning of Favoritism:**

Favoritism implies treating certain individuals or groups preferentially over others. It involves showing bias or partiality, often based on personal relationships, kinship, or social status.

**Effects on Relationships:**

Favoritism can have severe negative effects on our relationships with others. Some potential consequences include:

**1. Distrust and Alienation:**

**2. Social Conflict:**
- Favoritism can create tensions and conflicts within families, communities, and workplaces.
- People may feel unfairly treated or disadvantaged by those who receive special favors.

**3. Reduced Productivity:**
