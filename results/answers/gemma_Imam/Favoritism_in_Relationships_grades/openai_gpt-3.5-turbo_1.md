**Meaning of Favoritism:**

Favoritism implies treating certain individuals or groups preferentially over others. It involves showing bias or partiality, often based on personal relationships, kinship, or social status.

**Effects on Relationships:**

Favoritism can have severe negative effects on our relationships with others. Some potential consequences include:

**1. Distrust and Alienation:**
- When individuals perceive favoritism, they may feel marginalized and undervalued.
- This can lead to feelings of distrust and alienation among those who are not receiving preferential treatment.

**2. Social Conflict:**
- Favoritism can create tensions and conflicts within families, communities, and workplaces.
- People may feel unfairly treated or disadvantaged by those who receive special favors.

**3. Reduced Productivity:**
- When individuals feel favored, they may become complacent or less motivated.
- This can lead to reduced productivity and efficiency in both personal and professional settings.

**4. Damage to Reputation:**

**5. Family and Social Disruption:**
