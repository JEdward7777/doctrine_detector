  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the concept of fellowship in a Christian context. While they acknowledge that the term is primarily used in Christian contexts, they fail to provide any elaboration or explanation of its spiritual significance. The reference answer provides a more comprehensive and theological understanding of fellowship as the unity of believers in Christ and their shared relationship through their faith."
