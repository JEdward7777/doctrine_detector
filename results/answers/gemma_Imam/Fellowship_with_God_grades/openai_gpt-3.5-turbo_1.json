However, while the content is informative and insightful, it does not directly address the specific concern that understanding fellowship with God in Christianity centers on faith in Jesus and His sacrificial death on the cross as the basis for a personal relationship with God. The response could have benefited from incorporating this Christian-specific viewpoint to fully address the concern raised."
