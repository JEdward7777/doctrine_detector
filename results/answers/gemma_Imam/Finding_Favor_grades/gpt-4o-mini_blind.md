Comment: The answer provides a solid explanation of what it means to "find favor" with someone in a biblical context, supported by relevant scripture references and examples. The student effectively connects the concept to seeking God's favor in the Quran as well. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the centrality of Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator of God's favor in the New Testament, and by expanding on the grace-based aspect of finding favor in Christianity. Additionally, a clearer distinction between Christian and Islamic beliefs on finding favor would enhance the answer.
