They provide clear definitions and examples from scripture to support their claims. Additionally, their inclusion of the Quranic reference demonstrates an awareness of different religious perspectives on the topic. \n\nHowever, there is room for improvement in the clarity of their explanation of the relationship between finding favor and cultivating relationships characterized by mutual approval and blessing. The student could further elaborate on the importance of reciprocity and the mutual exchange of blessing in building healthy relationships."
