However, the answer does not address the Christian perspective on finding grace in the eyes of God as the question posed. It would have been beneficial to include references to the Bible, teachings of Jesus Christ, and the concept of grace through faith in Christianity. Integrating a comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on grace would enrich the response and demonstrate a broader understanding of the topic."
