  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: \nThe student provides a comprehensive and well-written response on the concept of finding grace in the eyes of God from an Islamic perspective. They clearly outline the importance of humility, repentance, gratitude, and compassion in seeking and recognizing God's favor. However, the response deviates from the Christian-specific worldview requested, focusing on Islamic teachings and references. To improve the grade, the student should ensure their answer aligns with a Christian perspective on grace and include relevant biblical references or examples."
