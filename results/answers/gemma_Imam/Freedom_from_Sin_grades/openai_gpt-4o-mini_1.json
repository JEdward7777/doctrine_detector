The suggested solutions of recognizing God's forgiveness, repentance, gracious living, forgiveness of past sins, and trusting in God's continuous love are all rooted in biblical principles and demonstrate a genuine understanding of Christian faith. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references further strengthens the response. Overall, this is a comprehensive and well-articulated perspective from a Christian worldview."
