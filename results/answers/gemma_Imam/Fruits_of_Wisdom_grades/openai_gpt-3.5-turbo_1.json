While the virtues mentioned are important for spiritual growth and reflect a sense of moral character, there is a lack of explicit connection to Christ-like character as per the concern raised. The response could be strengthened by discussing how these virtues align with the character of Christ or the teachings of Jesus, which are central to reflecting the fruits of the Holy Spirit in one's life from a Christian perspective."
