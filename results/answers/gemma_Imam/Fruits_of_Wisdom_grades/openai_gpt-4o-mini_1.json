However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern raised in the Christian-specific worldview given. While the virtues discussed are admirable and aligned with moral teachings, from a Christian perspective, the essential aspect of these fruits being rooted in Christ and reflecting His character is not explicitly emphasized. In discussing spiritual growth and virtues, it is crucial to highlight the source and foundation of these qualities in Christ."
