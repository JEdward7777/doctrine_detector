**When a prophecy is said to be fulfilled according to Biblical teaching, it means:**

- The fulfillment aligns with the specific prophecies recorded in the Bible that were foretold about the coming of Jesus Christ.
- The fulfillment fulfills the literal or symbolic meaning of the prophecy as understood by biblical scholars and theologians.


**Relevant Biblical prophecies about Jesus Christ:**

- **Messianic prophecies:** Many prophecies in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) foretold the coming of a Messiah, who would be the promised descendant of Abraham and the rightful heir to the throne. 
- **Birth prophecies:** Specific prophecies predicted the place, timing, and manner of Jesus' birth.
- **Suffering and resurrection prophecies:** Prophecies spoke of the Messiah suffering and dying for the sins of humanity, and rising from the dead.


**Islamic perspective:**

- Muslims believe that Jesus Christ (Isa) was a prophet of God, but they do not consider him to be the Son of God or the Messiah.
- The Islamic understanding of prophecy aligns with the Quran and the Sunnah (teachings of Prophet Muhammad).
- The fulfillment of prophecies is seen as evidence of God's sovereignty and power, supporting the Islamic faith.


**Common interpretations of fulfilled prophecies:**

- **Symbolic fulfillment:** Some prophecies may have symbolic or allegorical meaning.
- **Progressive fulfillment:** Certain prophecies may be fulfilled over time, rather than at a single specific event.
- **Interpretations by scholars:** Different scholars and Islamic schools of thought may interpret the fulfillment of prophecies differently.
