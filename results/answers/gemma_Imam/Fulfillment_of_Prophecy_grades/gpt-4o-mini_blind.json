From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to emphasize that the fulfillment of prophecies in the Christian faith specifically pertains to those found in the Bible, particularly the Old Testament pointing to Jesus as the Messiah. While the importance of fulfilled prophecies is adequately addressed, the inclusion of Islamic tradition detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the response. In future explanations, it is essential to remain focused on the Biblical context when discussing Christian beliefs."
