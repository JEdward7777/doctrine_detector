The explanation is well-structured and addresses the concern of acknowledging the figurative language surrounding 'soul'. However, it would have been beneficial to include more specific references to biblical passages that support the points made. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into how these insights can enhance Islamic spiritual practices specifically. Overall, a solid analysis with room for further elaboration and connection to biblical teachings."
