## [Answer](../Gift_of_Evangelism.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**An evangelist is a Christian who seeks to share their faith with others and encourage them to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior.** 

There are several key things that distinguish evangelists from other Christians:

**1. Focus on Evangelism:**

* Evangelists prioritize sharing their faith and inviting others to accept Christ as their Lord and Savior. 
* They often engage in activities such as preaching, sharing their testimonies, and organizing evangelistic events.

**2. Passion for Souls:**

* Evangelists have a deep-seated concern for the spiritual well-being of others. 
* They believe that everyone has the potential to be saved through faith in Christ.

**3. Emphasis on Conversion:**

* Evangelists actively seek to bring people to a personal relationship with Christ. 
* They often use persuasive arguments and emotional appeals to encourage people to accept Christ as their savior.

**4. Apostolic Authority:**

* Evangelists often claim apostolic authority, meaning they believe they have been commissioned by God to spread the Gospel. 
* This belief can sometimes lead to conflict with other Christians who disagree with their teachings or methods.

**5. Distinctive Beliefs and Practices:**

* Evangelists sometimes hold beliefs or practices that are not shared by other Christians. 
* For example, some evangelists emphasize tithing or specific prayer practices.

**It's important to note:**

* Not all Christians are evangelists. Many Christians are content to live their lives without actively sharing their faith.
* Evangelists represent a diverse range of beliefs and practices. There is no one "evangelical" way to follow Christ.
