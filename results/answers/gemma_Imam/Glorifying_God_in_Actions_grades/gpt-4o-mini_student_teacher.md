## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's response a 70.

While the student provided a comprehensive list of ways a believer can actively glorify Allah in their daily life, there is a lack of emphasis on the importance of reflecting God's glory to others. The reference answer from the teacher highlighted the significance of sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments to reflect His glory. The student covered various aspects such as kindness, gratitude, purity, remembrance, adherence to Islamic principles, mindfulness, acts of gratitude, glorifying Allah in adversity, acts of obedience, and continuous growth and development. However, the student's answer could be strengthened by incorporating more explicit ways in which believers can showcase God's greatness in their interactions with others and in their testimony. Thus, the student's answer, while thorough, could benefit from a deeper focus on reflecting God's glory to others.
