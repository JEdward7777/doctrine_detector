# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The significance of intentionality in God's calling is central to Islamic belief for several reasons:**

**1. Purity of Intention:**

* Islam emphasizes the purity of intention (niyah) in all actions and beliefs.
* God's calling is not merely an objective event but a conscious response to it.
* The intention of the heart aligns the action with God's purpose.

**2. Responsibility and Accountability:**

* The conscious intention to respond to God's call implies responsibility for one's actions.
* By acknowledging the intentional nature of the call, Muslims are held accountable for their obedience or neglect of God's guidance.

**3. Active Response:**

* The term "call" implies an active response from the recipient.
* God's call is not a passive event but a challenge to engage in spiritual growth and righteousness.
* The conscious intention to answer the call signifies an eagerness to please God and embark on the path of righteousness.

**4. Connection with Divine Purpose:**

* The intentionality of God's call aligns with the Islamic belief in divine purpose.
* Every action and event has a predetermined purpose in God's plan.
* The conscious intention to respond to the call demonstrates that Muslims recognize their place in God's greater design.

**5. Spiritual Growth:**

* The process of responding to God's call is itself a spiritual journey.
* The conscious intention to follow God's guidance fosters growth in faith and understanding.

**In Islamic tradition, the 'call' is often associated with the angels who convey God's message. The intentionality of their call reminds Muslims that:**

* The angels are messengers of God with a specific purpose.
* The call to righteousness is deliberate and deliberate action is required to respond effectively.

Therefore, the term "call" in Islamic context emphasizes the conscious and purposeful response to God's guidance, highlighting the importance of intentionality in spiritual growth and fulfillment of God's purpose.
