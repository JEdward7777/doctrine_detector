Grade: 40

Comment: The student did a good job in providing a detailed explanation of Islamic beliefs related to monotheism and the goodness of Allah. However, the student missed the mark on addressing the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs from a Christian perspective. The student's response did not discuss the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness, which is a key aspect of the Christian worldview. In order to align with the concern provided, the student should have focused more on how Jesus' statement points to God as the ultimate source of goodness and highlighted the importance of aligning our actions and beliefs with God's moral standards.
