  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does address the concern of recognizing the source of goodness, as it explicitly states that Jesus' statement aligns with Islamic teachings and reinforces monotheistic beliefs in Islam. It also provides some insightful Quranic references to support its claims.\n\nHowever, the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its discussion of the concept of goodness and how it relates to Islamic teachings. The connection between Jesus' statement and Islamic monotheism is well-established, but the response could delve deeper into the implications of this statement for daily life and faith practice.\n\nFurthermore, while the response does touch on the idea that goodness ultimately comes from Allah, it could explore more fully what this means for our actions and beliefs. How should we rely on Allah in our pursuit of goodness? What are some practical applications of recognizing Allah as the source of all goodness?\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic teachings and Jesus' statement, but could benefit from further development and application."
