It effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs from an Islamic perspective. The response is well-structured, supported by relevant Quranic references, and draws meaningful lessons from the statement. The only aspect that could be improved is a more explicit connection to the ultimate standard of goodness being God as stated in the provided answer."
