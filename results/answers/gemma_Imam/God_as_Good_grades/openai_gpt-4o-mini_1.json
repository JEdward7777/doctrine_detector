However, the response could have further emphasized the unique Christian perspective on the statement, connecting it to the Christian doctrine of God's moral perfection as the ultimate standard of goodness. Additionally, incorporating more specific references to Christian teachings would have strengthened the analysis from a Christian worldview."
