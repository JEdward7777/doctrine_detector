However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to note that the theological nuances, scriptural references, and doctrinal foundations differ significantly between Islam and Christianity. The response could have been improved by specifically addressing the Christian understanding of a 'remnant' and God's selective grace, rather than applying Islamic concepts to this question. Additionally, tying in biblical references and theological tenets specific to Christianity would have enhanced the answer."
