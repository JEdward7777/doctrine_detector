The theological basis and implications of this concept are well articulated, drawing on relevant Islamic beliefs and historical examples. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the transformative impact of being chosen by God on the lives of the 'remnant' individuals or groups, particularly in terms of their spiritual growth and mission in fulfilling God's purposes."
