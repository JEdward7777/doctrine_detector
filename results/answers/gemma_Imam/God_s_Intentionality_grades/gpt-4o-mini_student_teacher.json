  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response exploring the Islamic perspective on intentionality in God's calling. However, the answer did not directly address the Christian-specific worldview concerning God's intentional interaction with humanity. To improve the grade, the student should focus on integrating Christian beliefs and perspectives related to God's intentional calling and how it impacts human responsibility, accountability, and relationship with God."
