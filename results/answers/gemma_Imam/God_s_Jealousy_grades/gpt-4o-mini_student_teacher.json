They made connections to Allah's protective nature and the Quranic teachings on Allah's relationship with believers. However, the answer strayed from the Christian specific worldview requested in the concern. The student should have focused more on God's jealousy described in the Bible and how it relates to His character and desire for spiritual fidelity in a Christian context."
