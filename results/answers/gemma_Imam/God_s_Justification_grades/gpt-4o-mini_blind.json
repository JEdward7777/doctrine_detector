  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-structured explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding God's justification of sinners. However, from a Christian worldview, this answer does not align with essential Christian doctrines of justification by faith in Jesus Christ alone, through His atoning sacrifice on the cross. The student's answer correctly articulates Islamic beliefs, but deviates from Christian theological perspectives on this topic."
