While Islam has its own concept of justification, the response conflates Islamic terminology and concepts with Christian beliefs. The student should have focused on explaining the Christian perspective on justification in accordance with the reference answer. Additionally, the answer lacks clarity in explaining the role of faith in the process of justification and fails to mention the importance of Jesus Christ in God's redemption plan."
