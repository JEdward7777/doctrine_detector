The response should focus more on explaining how justification in Christianity is based on faith in Jesus Christ as the atonement for sin, rather than on repentance and good deeds as in Islam. Additionally, it should emphasize the unique role of Jesus in mediating between God and humanity for the forgiveness of sins."
