  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 50/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the significance of God's name 'Yahweh' within Christianity. It fails to acknowledge that the name 'Yahweh' is significant only within the biblical tradition and not in Islamic beliefs. The answer also lacks clarity and depth in explaining the significance of the name 'Yahweh' as revealed in the Bible."
