While the initial student response correctly states that the name 'Yahweh' does not appear in the Quran or Islamic tradition, it overlooks the potential depth and impact that understanding and incorporating the significance of God's name can have on one's worship and reverence. An additional point could have been made to illustrate how comprehending the significance of God's name can lead to a deeper connection with Him in worship."
