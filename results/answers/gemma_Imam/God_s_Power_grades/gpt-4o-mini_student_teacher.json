However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern that understanding God's omnipotence is fundamental to faith and worship. Connecting the attributes mentioned with the importance of acknowledging God's omnipotence in one's faith practice would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
