The incorporation of examples from the Bible, such as Abraham, David, and the New Covenant, helps elucidate the concept further. However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern regarding how understanding God's promises can help believers trust His faithfulness in their own lives. More explicit connections to personal application and practical implications for believers could enhance the depth of the response."
