  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized response with specific steps to discern God's plan according to Islamic teachings. However, the answer did not align with the Christian-specific worldview provided in the reference answer. In a Christian worldview, guidance is sought primarily through prayer, reading the Bible, seeking counsel from mature Christians, and observing circumstances and opportunities presented by God. The student's answer did not incorporate these key elements from a Christian perspective, leading to a lower grade."
