These practices align well with seeking guidance from God in Christianity. However, there could have been more direct references to the Bible and the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as a central aspect of discerning God's plan. Additionally, addressing the concern of believers feeling lost or confused could have been more explicitly tied to seeking God's guidance through prayer and seeking counsel from mature Christians. Overall, a good response with room for a bit more depth and specificity in relation to Christian beliefs and practices."
