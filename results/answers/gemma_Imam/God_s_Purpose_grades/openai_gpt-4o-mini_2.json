The response could have incorporated more specific advice on how to address these feelings of confusion and uncertainty within a Christian worldview. The response also missed out on emphasizing the importance of trust in God's providence and sovereignty, similar to how the concept of trusting in Allah's decree was highlighted in the provided Islamic guidelines."
