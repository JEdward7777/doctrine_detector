## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The understanding of God's self-revelation differs between Islamic and Christian traditions. While the Bible contains references to God's name, Muslims interpret these differently than Christians.

**In the Islamic perspective:**

* The Quran primarily uses the name "Allah" for God, which is considered the perfect and complete name of the Creator.
* The Bible is seen as a previous revelation from God, but Muslims believe it contains historical and allegorical references to God's name, rather than a complete revelation of his essence.
* The precise nature and attributes of God are primarily revealed through the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.

**The Bible reveals God's name as:**

* **Yahweh:** Primarily used in the Hebrew Bible, this name signifies the covenant relationship between God and his people.
* **Jehovah:** A later interpretation of the Hebrew name Yahweh, emphasizing his unchanging nature and sovereignty.
* **Lord:** A translation of the Hebrew names, indicating God's greatness, power, and authority.

**The Islamic understanding of these names:**

* Muslims acknowledge that these names are titles or attributes describing God's character, but they do not represent his essence or complete self-revelation.
* The Quran emphasizes that Allah's essence is beyond human comprehension.

**Therefore, while the Bible introduces God using various names, Muslims interpret these names as representing God's attributes and relationship with his creation, rather than revealing his ultimate essence or identity.**
