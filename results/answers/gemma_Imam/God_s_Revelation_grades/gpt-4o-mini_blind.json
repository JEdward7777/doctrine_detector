The reference to the names of God in both the Bible and the Quran is well explained. However, the explanation could be enhanced by emphasizing the Christian belief that the names of God in the Bible, particularly Yahweh and Jehovah, provide insights into God's character and nature, including His holiness, faithfulness, and sovereignty. Additionally, the Christian perspective on the significance of God's names in establishing a personal and covenantal relationship with His people could be further elaborated upon for a more complete understanding."
