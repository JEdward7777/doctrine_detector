## [Answer](../God_s_Revelation.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The understanding of God's self-revelation differs between Islamic and Christian traditions. While the Bible contains references to God's name, Muslims interpret these differently than Christians.

**In the Islamic perspective:**

* The Quran primarily uses the name "Allah" for God, which is considered the perfect and complete name of the Creator.
* The Bible is seen as a previous revelation from God, but Muslims believe it contains historical and allegorical references to God's name, rather than a complete revelation of his essence.
* The precise nature and attributes of God are primarily revealed through the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.

**The Bible reveals God's name as:**

* **Yahweh:** Primarily used in the Hebrew Bible, this name signifies the covenant relationship between God and his people.
* **Jehovah:** A later interpretation of the Hebrew name Yahweh, emphasizing his unchanging nature and sovereignty.
* **Lord:** A translation of the Hebrew names, indicating God's greatness, power, and authority.

**The Islamic understanding of these names:**

* Muslims acknowledge that these names are titles or attributes describing God's character, but they do not represent his essence or complete self-revelation.
* The Quran emphasizes that Allah's essence is beyond human comprehension.

**Therefore, while the Bible introduces God using various names, Muslims interpret these names as representing God's attributes and relationship with his creation, rather than revealing his ultimate essence or identity.**

**Comment:** 
The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the different perspectives on God's self-revelation in the Bible and Quran. It provides a clear explanation of the significance of various names used for God in both traditions and highlights the differences in their interpretations. The response also acknowledges the limits of human comprehension of God's essence, which aligns with the Christian worldview. However, it could benefit from further elaboration on how the name 'Yahweh' specifically reveals God's identity and covenant relationship with his people, as per the reference answer.
