  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation. However, the answer lacks clarity and depth in explaining the theological concept of rebirth or new birth as seen from a Christian worldview. The answer would benefit from further elaboration on the role of faith, redemption, and the work of the Holy Spirit in the process of salvation."
