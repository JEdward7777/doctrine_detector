What is God's role in the process of a person being born again?

# Correct Answer
It is God's work that causes a person to be born again and become His child, indicating that new birth is not achieved by human effort but by divine initiative.

# Stated Concern
This question emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation.

# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**There is no concept of reincarnation in Islam.** The belief in reincarnation is not compatible with Islamic teachings or the Quranic worldview.

**In Islam, belief in the afterlife consists of:**

* Belief in the Day of Judgement and accountability for actions
* Belief in Jannah (Paradise) for the righteous
* Belief in Jahannam (Hell) for the wicked

**The process of birth and death is seen as a natural cycle of life and death, and God's role in this process is to:**

* Sustain life and creation
* Judge the actions of individuals
* Guide and support those who seek his guidance
