**Comment:** This response effectively explores the relationship between God's timing and our expectations in life by highlighting the importance of trusting in His sovereignty. The writer provides a clear and concise explanation of how recognizing an appointed time can foster faith in God's plans, promoting humility, patience, gratitude, and hope.
