  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student correctly identifies the Christian-specific question and concern but fails to provide a relevant answer based on their perspective. Since the question and concern specified a Christian worldview, the student's response is not aligned with the grading criteria. In order to receive a higher grade, the student should have attempted to explain the Christian perspective even from their own perspective within an Islamic framework."
