Comment: The response given acknowledges the concept of divine punishment for disbelief in a straightforward manner. However, the concern provided specifically references the nature of God's judgment and the consequences for disbelief. While the response touches on the idea of God's wrath, it could have delved deeper into explaining the nature of God's judgment and the consequences for disbelief from a Christian worldview.
