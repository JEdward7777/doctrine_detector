  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response, exploring different aspects of how God's zeal is reflected in His actions towards His people. However, the student's answer did not directly align with the reference answer, which emphasizes God's efforts to bless His people and ensure justice. While the student's points on God's love, involvement, protection, guidance, empowerment, and reward are valuable, the focus strayed slightly from the specific concern of recognizing God's zeal to deepen believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being. Encouraging the student to connect their insights more directly to the reference answer would enhance the response."
