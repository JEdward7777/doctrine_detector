  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides a thorough explanation of godliness from a Christian perspective, there is a fundamental deviation from the reference answer. The student mentions Allah instead of God, which is the Arabic word for God used in Islam. This demonstrates a confusion of theological concepts and terminology. Additionally, the mention of Allah may lead to confusion for those seeking guidance specifically from a Christian worldview. The student should have focused on the Christian understanding of God and godliness.\n"
