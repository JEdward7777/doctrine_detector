  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a clear definition of godliness, highlighting its connection to pleasing God, obeying Him, and living in a righteous manner. The Bible passages provided also help to illustrate and support this definition. Additionally, the characteristics of godly living listed are relevant and helpful for understanding how to embody godliness in daily life.\n\nHowever, I would have liked to see more specific guidance on how to incorporate godliness into daily actions. While some suggestions are made, such as obedience to God's commands and prayer and devotion, the response could benefit from more concrete examples of what this might look like in practical terms.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively defines godliness and provides relevant biblical support. With a bit more emphasis on practical application, it could be even stronger."
