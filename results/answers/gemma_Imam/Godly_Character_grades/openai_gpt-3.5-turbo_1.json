The response effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the characteristics of a godly individual and how to cultivate them in daily life. The incorporation of examples from the Quran and Sunnah further strengthens the answer. However, the response could have explored the concept of love, joy, and self-control in more depth to directly contrast with the Christian perspective. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
