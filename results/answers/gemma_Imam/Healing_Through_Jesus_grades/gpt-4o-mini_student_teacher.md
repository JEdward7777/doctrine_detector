## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would give this student's answer a grade of 70. While the student provides a comprehensive overview of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals and includes elements of compassion, authority, healing, and spiritual warfare, the response goes beyond the specified concern. The concern emphasizes recognizing Jesus' authority over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing, which the student's answer somewhat touches on but does not explicitly focus on. The reference answer provided by the teacher emphasizes the specific aspect of Jesus commanding the demons to come out, which is the core focus of the concern. Therefore, while the student's answer is detailed and well-written, it could be improved by focusing more directly on the key point of Jesus commanding demons to come out.
