The response correctly acknowledges the Old Testament significance of anointing but falls short in exploring the New Testament context more thoroughly. It could benefit from citing examples like James 5:14-15, where believers are encouraged to call the elders to anoint and pray for the sick. Additionally, the statement that the practice of anointing for healing in Christian traditions is not based on direct biblical authority is somewhat misleading, as it overlooks the scriptural basis mentioned above. Further scriptural references and a clearer explanation of the significance of anointing in healing contexts would strengthen this response."
