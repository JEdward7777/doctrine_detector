## Question [Healing through Anointing](../../../questions/Healing_through_Anointing.md)
How is the practice of anointing related to healing in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
In the New Testament, sick people were anointed with oil as a practice for seeking healing, symbolizing the request for God's intervention and healing power.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice.

## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The practice of anointing is not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament as a means of healing. However, some biblical accounts suggest the use of physical anointing as a symbol of blessing or spiritual healing.

In the Old Testament, anointing is frequently associated with spiritual empowerment and blessing. For example, the prophets Elijah and Elisha were anointed with oil as a symbol of their divine calling and authority.

While there is no direct precedent for physical anointing as a healing practice in the New Testament, Christian traditions have sometimes incorporated anointing with oils as a ritual or prayer practice associated with healing. This practice is not based on direct biblical authority but on cultural and spiritual influences.

Comment: The answer provides a fair overview of the subject but lacks depth in addressing the connection between anointing and healing in the New Testament. The response correctly acknowledges the Old Testament significance of anointing but falls short in exploring the New Testament context more thoroughly. It could benefit from citing examples like James 5:14-15, where believers are encouraged to call the elders to anoint and pray for the sick. Additionally, the statement that the practice of anointing for healing in Christian traditions is not based on direct biblical authority is somewhat misleading, as it overlooks the scriptural basis mentioned above. Further scriptural references and a clearer explanation of the significance of anointing in healing contexts would strengthen this response.
