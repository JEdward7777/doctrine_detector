  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the historical significance of anointing in the Old Testament and its symbolic nature in the New Testament. However, the student misses the key point that anointing with oil for healing is indeed practiced in the New Testament. The student acknowledges the use of anointing in Christian traditions for healing but could have connected it more directly to New Testament practices as outlined in the reference answer. Despite the missed connection, the student shows understanding of the concept of anointing in a Christian context."
