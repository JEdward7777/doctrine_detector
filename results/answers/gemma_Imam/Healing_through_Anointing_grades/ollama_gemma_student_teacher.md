Recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice.

## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The practice of anointing is not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament as a means of healing. However, some biblical accounts suggest the use of physical anointing as a symbol of blessing or spiritual healing.

In the Old Testament, anointing is frequently associated with spiritual empowerment and blessing. For example, the prophets Elijah and Elisha were anointed with oil as a symbol of their divine calling and authority.

While there is no direct precedent for physical anointing as a healing practice in the New Testament, Christian traditions have sometimes incorporated anointing with oils as a ritual or prayer practice associated with healing. This practice is not based on direct biblical authority but on cultural and spiritual influences.
