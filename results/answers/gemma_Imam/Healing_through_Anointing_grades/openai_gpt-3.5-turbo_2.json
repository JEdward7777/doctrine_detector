The response appropriately mentions how Christian traditions have incorporated anointing with oils for healing but notes that it is not directly based on biblical authority. The explanation demonstrates an understanding of the practice of anointing in both Old and New Testament contexts, but could further emphasize the reliance on God's intervention and power in healing rather than on physical anointing itself."
