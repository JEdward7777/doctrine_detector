While it correctly mentions Christian tradition incorporating anointing with oils for healing, the lack of emphasis on the New Testament basis for this practice hinders a comprehensive understanding of anointing in the context of Christian practice. Further elaboration on the biblical support for anointing in seeking physical healing would enhance the response."
