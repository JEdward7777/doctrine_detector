**1. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)**

The Prophet Muhammad was allowed to approach the Ark on two occasions:

* During the Night Journey (Lailat al-Miraj), when he ascended to heaven and was shown the secrets of the prophets.
* During his visit to the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca.

**2. Hudhayfah ibn Yusuf al-Yamami**

Hudhayfah was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad who was entrusted with guarding the Ark of the Covenant after the Prophet's death. He was permitted to approach and handle the Ark under strict conditions and only for necessary purposes.
