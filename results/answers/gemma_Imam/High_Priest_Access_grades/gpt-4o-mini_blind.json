The Ark of the Covenant is a sacred object in Judeo-Christian tradition, not in Islamic tradition. Prophet Muhammad and Hudhayfah ibn Yusuf al-Yamami have no connection to the Ark of the Covenant as described in the Bible. The student should have presented accurate information based on Christian beliefs regarding the Ark of the Covenant."
