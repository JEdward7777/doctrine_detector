## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic tradition, only two individuals were permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)**

The Prophet Muhammad was allowed to approach the Ark on two occasions:

* During the Night Journey (Lailat al-Miraj), when he ascended to heaven and was shown the secrets of the prophets.
* During his visit to the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca.

**2. Hudhayfah ibn Yusuf al-Yamami**

Hudhayfah was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad who was entrusted with guarding the Ark of the Covenant after the Prophet's death. He was permitted to approach and handle the Ark under strict conditions and only for necessary purposes.

Grade: 10

Comment: The student provided incorrect information in their response. The Ark of the Covenant is a sacred object in Judeo-Christian tradition, not in Islamic tradition. Prophet Muhammad and Hudhayfah ibn Yusuf al-Yamami have no connection to the Ark of the Covenant as described in the Bible. The student should have presented accurate information based on Christian beliefs regarding the Ark of the Covenant.
