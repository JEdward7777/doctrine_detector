In the Christian worldview, the only individual permitted to approach the ark of the covenant was the high priest, and that too only once a year on the Day of Atonement as specified in the Bible. The references to Prophet Muhammad and Hudhayfah in the Islamic tradition are not relevant to the Christian understanding of the ark and its significance. The answer does not demonstrate an understanding of the role of the high priest within Israelite religious practices."
