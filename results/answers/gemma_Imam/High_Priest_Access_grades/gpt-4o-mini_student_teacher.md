## Question [High Priest Access](../../../questions/High_Priest_Access.md)
Who was allowed to approach the ark of the covenant and under what circumstances?

## Correct Answer
Only the high priest could approach the ark, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant.

## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic tradition, only two individuals were permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)**

The Prophet Muhammad was allowed to approach the Ark on two occasions:

* During the Night Journey (Lailat al-Miraj), when he ascended to heaven and was shown the secrets of the prophets.
* During his visit to the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca.

**2. Hudhayfah ibn Yusuf al-Yamami**

Hudhayfah was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad who was entrusted with guarding the Ark of the Covenant after the Prophet's death. He was permitted to approach and handle the Ark under strict conditions and only for necessary purposes.

Grade: 0

Comment: The student's answer is incorrect from a Christian perspective. In the Christian worldview, the only individual permitted to approach the ark of the covenant was the high priest, and that too only once a year on the Day of Atonement as specified in the Bible. The references to Prophet Muhammad and Hudhayfah in the Islamic tradition are not relevant to the Christian understanding of the ark and its significance. The answer does not demonstrate an understanding of the role of the high priest within Israelite religious practices.
