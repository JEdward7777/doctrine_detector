Recognizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant.

## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic tradition, only two individuals were permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)**

The Prophet Muhammad was allowed to approach the Ark on two occasions:

* During the Night Journey (Lailat al-Miraj), when he ascended to heaven and was shown the secrets of the prophets.
* During his visit to the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca.

**2. Hudhayfah ibn Yusuf al-Yamami**

Hudhayfah was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad who was entrusted with guarding the Ark of the Covenant after the Prophet's death. He was permitted to approach and handle the Ark under strict conditions and only for necessary purposes.

**Comment:** 
The student's answer is fundamentally incorrect as it refers to Islamic tradition and individuals rather than the Israelite covenant and the role of the high priest. The correct answer according to the given reference is that only the high priest could approach the ark, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement.
