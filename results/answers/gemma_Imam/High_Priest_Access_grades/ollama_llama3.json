While it mentions the Ark of the Covenant, it provides incorrect information about who was permitted to approach it. In reality, only the high priest could approach the ark, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement, as stated in the provided answer.\n\nThe response also introduces irrelevant information from Islamic tradition, including Prophet Muhammad's interactions with the Ark of the Covenant, which is not relevant to the original concern. Additionally, it fails to acknowledge or recognize the significance of the high priest's role in Israelite worship and covenantal relationship with God. To improve this response, it would be essential to focus on the correct information about who could approach the ark and the importance of the high priest's role in Israelite worship."
