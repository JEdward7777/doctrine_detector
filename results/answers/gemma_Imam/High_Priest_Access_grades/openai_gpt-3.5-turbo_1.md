# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic tradition, only two individuals were permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)**

The Prophet Muhammad was allowed to approach the Ark on two occasions:

* During the Night Journey (Lailat al-Miraj), when he ascended to heaven and was shown the secrets of the prophets.
* During his visit to the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca.

**2. Hudhayfah ibn Yusuf al-Yamami**

Hudhayfah was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad who was entrusted with guarding the Ark of the Covenant after the Prophet's death. He was permitted to approach and handle the Ark under strict conditions and only for necessary purposes.

Grade: 10/100

Comment: The response provided contains inaccurate information regarding the individuals permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant in the Islamic tradition. The specific concern of recognizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant is not addressed at all. The Islamic tradition described in the response does not align with the Christian understanding of the Ark of the Covenant from the Old Testament. More accurate and scripturally supported information would be needed for a higher grade.
