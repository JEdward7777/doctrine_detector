In Christianity, only the high priest in the Old Testament was permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement as a mediator between the Israelites and God. The information provided about Prophet Muhammad and Hudhayfah in the Islamic tradition is not relevant to the Christian understanding of the Ark of the Covenant and its significance."
