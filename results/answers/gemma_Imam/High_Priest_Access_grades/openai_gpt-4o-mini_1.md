## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic tradition, only two individuals were permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)**

The Prophet Muhammad was allowed to approach the Ark on two occasions:

* During the Night Journey (Lailat al-Miraj), when he ascended to heaven and was shown the secrets of the prophets.
* During his visit to the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca.

**2. Hudhayfah ibn Yusuf al-Yamami**

Hudhayfah was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad who was entrusted with guarding the Ark of the Covenant after the Prophet's death. He was permitted to approach and handle the Ark under strict conditions and only for necessary purposes.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided is not accurate according to the Christian worldview. In Christianity, only the high priest in the Old Testament was permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement as a mediator between the Israelites and God. The information provided about Prophet Muhammad and Hudhayfah in the Islamic tradition is not relevant to the Christian understanding of the Ark of the Covenant and its significance.
