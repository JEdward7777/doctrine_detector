The answer given in the student's response about Prophet Muhammad and Hudhayfah approaching the Ark of the Covenant in the Islamic tradition is not relevant to the Christian context of the question. The focus should have been on the biblical account and the significance of the high priest's role in the Israelite's relationship with God."
