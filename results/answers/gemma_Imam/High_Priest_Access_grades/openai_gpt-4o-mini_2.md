Recognizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant.

## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic tradition, only two individuals were permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant:**

**1. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)**

The Prophet Muhammad was allowed to approach the Ark on two occasions:

* During the Night Journey (Lailat al-Miraj), when he ascended to heaven and was shown the secrets of the prophets.
* During his visit to the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca.

**2. Hudhayfah ibn Yusuf al-Yamami**

Hudhayfah was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad who was entrusted with guarding the Ark of the Covenant after the Prophet's death. He was permitted to approach and handle the Ark under strict conditions and only for necessary purposes.

Grade: 25

Comment: The response provided deviates significantly from the Christian understanding of the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant. The answer given in the student's response about Prophet Muhammad and Hudhayfah approaching the Ark of the Covenant in the Islamic tradition is not relevant to the Christian context of the question. The focus should have been on the biblical account and the significance of the high priest's role in the Israelite's relationship with God.
