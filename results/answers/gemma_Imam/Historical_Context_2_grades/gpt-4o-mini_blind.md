## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

## Correct Answer
The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a command from Allah. Allah revealed to Moses that they were to bake no leavened bread during their sojourn, as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Pharaoh's tyranny. The commandment is found in the Quran and is observed by Muslims and Jews alike as part of their religious traditions.

Grade: 50

Comment: While the student provided an answer, they attributed the commandment to Allah and referenced the Quran, which is not in line with a Christian worldview. In the Christian perspective, the Israelites were commanded by God, the God of the Bible, to eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt. Additionally, the answer did not mention the significance of Passover and the symbolism of the unleavened bread in pointing towards Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and overlooks key theological principles from a Christian standpoint.
