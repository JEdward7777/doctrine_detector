While it is true that the Israelites were commanded to eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt, attributing this command to Allah and referencing the Quran is not accurate in the Christian worldview. The appropriate Christian perspective would recognize that God, as described in the Bible, instructed the Israelites to eat unleavened bread as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Egypt and their deliverance from slavery."
