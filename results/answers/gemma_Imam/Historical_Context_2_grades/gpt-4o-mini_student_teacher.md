## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

## Correct Answer
The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a command from Allah. Allah revealed to Moses that they were to bake no leavened bread during their sojourn, as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Pharaoh's tyranny. The commandment is found in the Quran and is observed by Muslims and Jews alike as part of their religious traditions.

Grade: 40

Comment: The student's response is incorrect from a Christian perspective. While it is true that the Israelites were commanded to eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt, attributing this command to Allah and referencing the Quran is not accurate in the Christian worldview. The appropriate Christian perspective would recognize that God, as described in the Bible, instructed the Israelites to eat unleavened bread as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Egypt and their deliverance from slavery.
