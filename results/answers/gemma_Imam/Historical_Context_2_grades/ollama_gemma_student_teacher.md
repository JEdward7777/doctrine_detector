## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)

The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a command from Allah. Allah revealed to Moses that they were to bake no leavened bread during their sojourn, as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Pharaoh's tyranny. The commandment is found in the Quran and is observed by Muslims and Jews alike as part of their religious traditions.
