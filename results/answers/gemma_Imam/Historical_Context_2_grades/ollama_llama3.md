## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

## Correct Answer
The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a command from Allah. Allah revealed to Moses that they were to bake no leavened bread during their sojourn, as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Pharaoh's tyranny. The commandment is found in the Quran and is observed by Muslims and Jews alike as part of their religious traditions.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 60.

The response does attempt to recognize the historical events that shape religious practices, as instructed. However, it falls short in several areas. Firstly, the response incorrectly identifies Allah as the deity who gave the commandment, when in fact it was Yahweh, the God of Israel. This mistake is significant, as it blurs the distinction between Christian and Islamic traditions.

Additionally, the response does not explicitly link the command to eat unleavened bread during the Exodus to the original historical event described in the Bible (the Israelites' hasty departure from Egypt). Instead, it relies on a Quranic passage that may not be directly relevant to the Israelites' experience. This lack of biblical reference and connection detracts from the response's overall score.

To improve this response, I would suggest providing more explicit scriptural references and exploring the historical context surrounding the Israelites' flight from Egypt.
