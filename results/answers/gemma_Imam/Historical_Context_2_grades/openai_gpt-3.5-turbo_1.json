However, there is a concern in accurately recognizing the historical events that shape these religious practices. The response should mention Moses as the recipient of God's instructions rather than attributing it to Allah as in Islamic belief. It is important to clearly define the religious context from a Christian-specific worldview when discussing events from the Bible."
