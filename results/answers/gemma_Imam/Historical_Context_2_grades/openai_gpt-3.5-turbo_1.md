## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

## Correct Answer
The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a command from Allah. Allah revealed to Moses that they were to bake no leavened bread during their sojourn, as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Pharaoh's tyranny. The commandment is found in the Quran and is observed by Muslims and Jews alike as part of their religious traditions.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response correctly identifies the reason why the Israelites ate unleavened bread based on God's instructions for their quick escape from Egypt. However, there is a concern in accurately recognizing the historical events that shape these religious practices. The response should mention Moses as the recipient of God's instructions rather than attributing it to Allah as in Islamic belief. It is important to clearly define the religious context from a Christian-specific worldview when discussing events from the Bible.
