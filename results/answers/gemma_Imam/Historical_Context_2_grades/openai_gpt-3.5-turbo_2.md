## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a command from Allah. Allah revealed to Moses that they were to bake no leavened bread during their sojourn, as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Pharaoh's tyranny. The commandment is found in the Quran and is observed by Muslims and Jews alike as part of their religious traditions.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response correctly identifies that the Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to do so during their escape from Egypt as part of their deliverance from slavery. However, the response lacks specificity regarding the religious context and historical events that shape this practice. It could be improved by explicitly mentioning the biblical account and the significance of the Passover in Jewish tradition, which would provide a more thorough understanding of how religious practices are shaped by historical events.
