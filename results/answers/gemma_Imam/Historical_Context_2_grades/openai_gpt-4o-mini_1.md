## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

## Correct Answer
The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a command from Allah. Allah revealed to Moses that they were to bake no leavened bread during their sojourn, as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Pharaoh's tyranny. The commandment is found in the Quran and is observed by Muslims and Jews alike as part of their religious traditions.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response correctly identifies that the Israelites ate unleavened bread as part of their deliverance from slavery under God's instruction. However, the response should acknowledge the specific Christian worldview, recognizing that the Israelites' escape from Egypt is a significant historical event in the Christian faith. The reference to Allah and the Quran in the original response does not align with a Christian perspective on the Exodus narrative.
