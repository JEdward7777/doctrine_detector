  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response is partially correct in stating that the Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly as part of their deliverance from slavery. However, the mention of Allah and the Quran in the original response is inaccurate and introduces a different religious perspective. This fails to recognize the historical events and the specific religious context (Christian) that shaped the Israelites' religious practices. The student provided a partially accurate response but mixed in elements inconsistent with the Christian viewpoint."
