## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

## Correct Answer
The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a command from Allah. Allah revealed to Moses that they were to bake no leavened bread during their sojourn, as a symbol of their haste in fleeing Pharaoh's tyranny. The commandment is found in the Quran and is observed by Muslims and Jews alike as part of their religious traditions.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response is partially correct in stating that the Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly as part of their deliverance from slavery. However, the mention of Allah and the Quran in the original response is inaccurate and introduces a different religious perspective. This fails to recognize the historical events and the specific religious context (Christian) that shaped the Israelites' religious practices. The student provided a partially accurate response but mixed in elements inconsistent with the Christian viewpoint.
