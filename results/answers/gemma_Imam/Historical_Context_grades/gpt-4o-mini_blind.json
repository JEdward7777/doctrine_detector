  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the concept of 'remnant' as seen in Isaiah and Amos from a biblical perspective. However, the inclusion of interpretations in an Islamic context deviates from the focus on a Christian-specific worldview. While the student's knowledge of Islamic beliefs is commendable, the response should have remained within the confines of a Christian theological framework. In a Christian worldview, the concept of 'remnant' is specifically tied to God's preservation of a faithful group within His chosen people, rather than being generalized to other religious beliefs. It's important to maintain doctrinal correctness when addressing biblical topics."
