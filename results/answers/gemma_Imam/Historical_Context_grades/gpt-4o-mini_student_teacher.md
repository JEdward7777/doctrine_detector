Grade: 65

Comment: The student provided a thorough explanation of biblical events illustrating the concept of 'remnant' in Isaiah and Amos. However, the inclusion of interpretation in an Islamic context and relevance to a Muslim context deviates from the Christian-specific worldview required for this question. The focus should have been solely on understanding the concept of 'remnant' in relation to God's promises in Isaiah and Amos, which the student did address adequately, but the extra content lowered the grade.
