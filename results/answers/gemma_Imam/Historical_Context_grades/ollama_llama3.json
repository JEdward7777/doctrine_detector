  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant information about Isaiah and Amos mentioning a remnant, but it lacks depth and does not fully address the concern of understanding the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises. While the response mentions the return of a remnant after exile and the preservation of a remnant despite judgment, it does not provide much context or explanation about what this means for God's covenant and promises.\n\nThe response also jumps abruptly from biblical events to an Islamic context, which is not directly relevant to the concern being addressed. The historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises is an important topic that deserves more attention and exploration.\n\nTo improve the grade, it would be helpful to provide more detailed explanations about the historical context of Isaiah and Amos' prophecies and how they relate to God's covenant and promises. It would also be beneficial to focus on a single biblical text or theme rather than jumping between different texts and contexts."
