However, the insertion of an interpretation in an Islamic context detracts from the focus on a Christian worldview and could be seen as diluting the specific theological significance of the Biblical events. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into the theological implications of the 'remnant' concept within Christian beliefs and how it reflects God's faithfulness to His covenant with His people."
