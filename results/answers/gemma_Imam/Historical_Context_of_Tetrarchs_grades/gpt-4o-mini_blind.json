The points are well outlined and supported with relevant details. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it would be beneficial for the student to make connections to how these historical events might have played a role in the context of Jesus' ministry and the early Christian church. Emphasizing the spiritual implications of these political changes could further enhance the response."
