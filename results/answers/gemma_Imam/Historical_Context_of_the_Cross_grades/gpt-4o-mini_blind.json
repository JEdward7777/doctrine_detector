  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that accurately explains how the Roman practice of crucifixion influenced the perception of the cross in early Christianity. The response effectively highlights the connections with pagan practices, the transformation of meaning, the distancing from paganism, the symbolic significance, and the cultural influence of the cross. The only area for improvement could be to further emphasize the unique and central role of Jesus's crucifixion in Christian theology, along with the atonement and redemption aspects. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
