They effectively address the connection with pagan practices, the transformation of meaning, the distancing from paganism, the symbolic significance, and the cultural influence of the cross. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on the central idea of transforming the cross from a symbol of death to one of life and hope. Additionally, the response lacks a direct comparison to Jesus' resurrection as the reference answer highlights."
