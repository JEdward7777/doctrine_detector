  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively elaborates on how early Christianity transformed the symbol of the cross from one of shame and suffering to one of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection. The response provides insightful points regarding the cultural, symbolic, and theological significance of this transformation within a Christian worldview. The only area for improvement would be to strengthen the connection to how this transformation is central to the Christian message, although the response does touch on this point throughout the explanation."
