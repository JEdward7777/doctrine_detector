  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing how the Roman practice of crucifixion, initially a symbol of shame and suffering, was transformed by early Christianity into a symbol of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection. The response provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the process by which the cross evolved in significance for Christians, highlighting the central theme of redemption and salvation. The integration of historical context, theological significance, and cultural impact demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Christian worldview."
