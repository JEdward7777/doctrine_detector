The inclusion of examples like Noah and his post-flood altar and Abraham with the Isaac sacrifice altar align well with the biblical examples provided. The response effectively addresses the concern by illustrating how learning about these historical examples can inspire Christians to express their faith and devotion through intentional acts of worship."
