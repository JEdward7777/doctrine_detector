While there is an attempt to introduce the Holy Spirit in unfamiliar contexts and emphasize Islamic monotheism, more direct comparisons and explanations addressing potential misconceptions would have strengthened the response. The response could benefit from a more comprehensive approach to addressing the concern provided."
