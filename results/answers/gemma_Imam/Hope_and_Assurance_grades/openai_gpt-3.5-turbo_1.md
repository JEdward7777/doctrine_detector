Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of hope in a Christian worldview and how having no hope contradicts the promises of God. The connection between hopelessness and lack of faith in God's goodness is well articulated. The deduction in points is due to the lack of further elaboration or examples to strengthen the argument further.
