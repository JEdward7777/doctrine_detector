  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided information on the term 'hosts' from an Islamic perspective, they failed to address the context and encompassing meanings of the term as specifically requested in the scripture. The explanation provided by the student does not align with the Christian worldview, which focuses on angels, the spirit world, and celestial bodies in the context of 'hosts' in scripture. The answer presented by the student, though informative about the Islamic understanding of 'hosts', does not address the concern of understanding the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority from a Christian perspective."
