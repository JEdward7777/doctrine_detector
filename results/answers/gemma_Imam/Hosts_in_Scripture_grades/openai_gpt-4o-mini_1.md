Comment: The response does a good job of explaining the term 'hosts' in scripture from an Islamic perspective, providing insight into how believers, angels, righteous people, companions of Paradise, and nations are referred to as hosts. However, it does not directly address the concern related to understanding the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority in impacting a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. The explanation could have been enriched by integrating how the concept of hosts in Islamic belief may intersect with notions of spiritual warfare and divine authority in a broader theological context.
