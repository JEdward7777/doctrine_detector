  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response aligns with the concern \"Reflecting on personal relationships and the impact of jealousy on them\" by providing a clear acknowledgment of jealousy as a warning sign for evaluating relationship health, rather than allowing it to foster resentment or suspicion. The response also emphasizes the importance of open communication and trust in resolving conflicts.\n\nHowever, while the response is generally well-structured and coherent, it could benefit from more explicit connections to Islamic principles and sources. For example, the response could have drawn on Quranic teachings about love, kindness, and forgiveness (e.g., Surah Al-Imran: 134) or Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) emphasis on reconciliation (Musnad Ahmad). Additionally, while the response mentions the importance of seeking support from Islamic sources, it does not provide specific examples or references to Islamic teachings that could inform personal relationships.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern and provides some practical advice for addressing jealousy in relationships. With more explicit connections to Islamic principles and sources, the response could be even stronger."
