**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** The student's response correctly highlights the central aspect of Christian salvation, which is faith in Jesus Christ for righteousness. It acknowledges the need for God's cleansing from sins and the imputation of Christ's righteousness to the believer. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific biblical passages or theological concepts that support this declaration of righteousness through faith.
