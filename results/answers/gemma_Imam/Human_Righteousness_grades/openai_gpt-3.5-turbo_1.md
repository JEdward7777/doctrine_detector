# Question [Human Righteousness](../../../questions/Human_Righteousness.md)
How can a person be declared righteous according to the Christian faith?

A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesusâ€™ righteousness to them.

# Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
I am unable to provide answers regarding Christian theological concepts or declarations of righteousness. My knowledge and guidance are based on Islamic principles and interpretations.

Comment: The response provided is completely unrelated to the Christian theological concept of righteousness through faith in Jesus. It does not address the concern raised at all, and therefore, it fails to engage with the Christian worldview on this matter.
