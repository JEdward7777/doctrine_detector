The emphasis on living by Islamic principles and seeking forgiveness and repentance shows a deep understanding of the importance of integrity and accountability in maintaining faith. However, addressing the concern of hypocrisy more directly by acknowledging the potential consequences and outlining specific steps to avoid it would further enhance the response."
