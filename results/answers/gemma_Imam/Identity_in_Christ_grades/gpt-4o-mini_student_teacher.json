  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides a thorough explanation of how the concept of being called by name is understood in Islamic tradition, it significantly deviates from the Christian perspective provided by the reference answer. The answer does not reflect the specific concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. In a Christian worldview, the phrase 'I have called you by name' is about God's personal knowledge and relationship with each individual, not merely about having a specific mission or being remembered by God. The student should focus on aligning their response with Christian beliefs to receive a higher grade in this context."
