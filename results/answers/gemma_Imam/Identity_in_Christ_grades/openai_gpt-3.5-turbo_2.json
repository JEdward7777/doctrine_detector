While this explanation sheds light on Islamic beliefs and practices, it does not directly address the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. The answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not connect the concept of being called by name to the Christian understanding of God's personal relationship with individuals through Jesus Christ."
