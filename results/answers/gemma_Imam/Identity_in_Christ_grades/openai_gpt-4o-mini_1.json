  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of being called by name in Islamic belief, emphasizing Allah's love, mercy, and guidance for believers. While insightful and well-structured, the answer does not address the specific concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. Therefore, the grade is lower as it lacks a direct connection to the Christian worldview and perspective."
