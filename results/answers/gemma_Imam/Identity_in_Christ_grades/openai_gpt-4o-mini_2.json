However, the concern specified a Christian worldview, and this response does not directly address that concern. While the ideas presented align with the concept of personal relationship and individual significance with God, the specific focus on Christ as central to understanding one's identity is missing. Integrating Christian beliefs about Christ as the cornerstone of identity would strengthen the response when viewed through a Christian worldview."
