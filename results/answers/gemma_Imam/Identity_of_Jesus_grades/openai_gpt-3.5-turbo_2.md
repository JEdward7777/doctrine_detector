**The name 'Jesus' in Arabic is 'Isa,' and it signifies 'one who is obedient to God.'**

**1. To preach monotheism and belief in the one God (Allah)**
Jesus emphasized the oneness of God and rejected polytheism.

**2. To establish the Islamic monotheistic faith**
Jesus' teachings laid the foundation for the Islamic belief in God's unity and the importance of following his laws and prophets.

**3. To bring peace and forgiveness**
Jesus came to preach peace and forgiveness, emphasizing God's love and mercy.

**4. To fulfill prophecies**
Islamic tradition believes that Jesus fulfilled prophecies made by previous prophets, including Abraham and Muhammad.

**5. To guide and inspire people**
Jesus' life and teachings serve as a source of guidance and inspiration for Muslims, reminding them of God's love and the importance of following his teachings.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides accurate information about the Islamic perspective on Jesus, emphasizing his role as a prophet and messenger of God. However, the response does not address the concern regarding the significance of Jesus's name as 'Yahweh saves' and His role as Savior in Christianity. To improve the grade, the response should have contrasted the Christian belief in Jesus as the Savior who saves people from sin with the Islamic perspective presented.
