Jesus emphasized the oneness of God and rejected polytheism.

Jesus' teachings laid the foundation for the Islamic belief in God's unity and the importance of following his laws and prophets.

**3. To bring peace and forgiveness**
Jesus came to preach peace and forgiveness, emphasizing God's love and mercy.

**4. To fulfill prophecies**
Islamic tradition believes that Jesus fulfilled prophecies made by previous prophets, including Abraham and Muhammad.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided is inaccurate and does not align with a Christian worldview. The given answer about the significance of Jesus's name as 'Yahweh saves' and His role as Savior is central to Christian belief, emphasizing His divinity and mission to save humanity from sin. The response being graded provides information from an Islamic perspective, which differs significantly from the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God and the Savior of the world.
