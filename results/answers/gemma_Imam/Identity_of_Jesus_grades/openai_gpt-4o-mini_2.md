Jesus' teachings laid the foundation for the Islamic belief in God's unity and the importance of following his laws and prophets.

**3. To bring peace and forgiveness**
Jesus came to preach peace and forgiveness, emphasizing God's love and mercy.

**4. To fulfill prophecies**
Islamic tradition believes that Jesus fulfilled prophecies made by previous prophets, including Abraham and Muhammad.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided in the answer is based on a Christian worldview that recognizes Jesus as the Savior who saves people from their sins. The concern was to assess the understanding of Jesus's name and His role as Savior, and the provided response does not align with the Christian perspective. The discussion focuses on Islamic beliefs about Jesus, portraying him as a prophet and messenger rather than the Son of God and Savior. To improve the grade, the answer should reflect the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God who came to save humanity through His sacrificial death and resurrection.
