The response emphasizes empathy, responsibility, respect, forgiveness, justice, and community strengthening, all of which are important values but does not specifically tie them back to the Christian context of forgiveness and reconciliation. Further integration of how recognizing iniquity as harmful acts relates to forgiveness and reconciliation within a Christian worldview would significantly strengthen the response."
