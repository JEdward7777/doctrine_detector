  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's response acknowledges the importance of the \"good news\" and highlights the respect Muslims have for this message, they did not directly address the mandate given by Jesus to Christians to spread the Gospel. The core concern of recognizing the specific mandate Christians have to proclaim the \"good news\" was not adequately addressed in the student's answer. The response provided valuable insights from an Islamic perspective but lacked emphasis on the Christian worldview regarding the urgency and command to share the message of salvation as instructed by Jesus."
