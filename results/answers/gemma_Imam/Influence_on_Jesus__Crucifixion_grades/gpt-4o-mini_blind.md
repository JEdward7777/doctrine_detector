Grade: 20

Comment: While the student correctly points out that the Sadducees and Pharisees were not directly responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus, it is important to acknowledge their involvement in influencing the decision-making process that eventually led to Jesus' crucifixion. The Pharisees, in particular, played a role in the events leading up to the crucifixion by challenging Jesus' teachings and authority, ultimately contributing to the religious and political climate that led to his arrest and crucifixion. A more comprehensive answer that explores this influence would have been more appropriate.
