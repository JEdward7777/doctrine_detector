## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student's answer is incorrect as it disregards the significant role that the Sadducees and Pharisees played in influencing the decision to crucify Jesus. By denying their involvement, the student fails to address the complexity of the religious leaders' interactions with Jesus and misses an opportunity to explore the implications of their actions for contemporary faith.
