  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the historical context surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. However, they fail to acknowledge the influence of the Sadducees and Pharisees in this event, which is a significant oversight considering the reference answer. Their grade reflects their partial understanding of the topic and their inability to provide a comprehensive analysis."
