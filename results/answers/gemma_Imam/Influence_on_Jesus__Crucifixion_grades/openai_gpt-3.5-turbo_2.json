It acknowledges the selfishness and hypocrisy of these religious leaders, which aligns with Christian teachings about their interactions with Jesus. The response also draws a parallel to contemporary faith by highlighting the importance of recognizing and addressing similar conflicts and challenges within religious leadership today."
