In the Bible, not the Quran, God promised Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession (Genesis 17:8). The Islamic perspectives mentioned are not in line with the Christian understanding of the promise to Abraham. The answer would benefit from a more accurate reflection of biblical teachings regarding this promise."
