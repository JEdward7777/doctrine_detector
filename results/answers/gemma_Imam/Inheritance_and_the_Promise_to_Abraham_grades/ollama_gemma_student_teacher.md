## [Answer](../Inheritance_and_the_Promise_to_Abraham.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Quran, Allah promised Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan as an eternal abode:**

> "I will surely make you successors on the earth." (Quran 2:129)

**This verse clearly states that:**

* Allah promised Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan.
* This promise is eternal, meaning it will last forever.
* Allah will make them successors on the earth, implying ownership and dominion over the land.

**Further Islamic interpretations and traditions elaborate on this promise:**

* **Sunni tradition:** The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) explained that the land of Canaan is a blessing for those who fear Allah and uphold his laws.
* **Shia tradition:** Imam Ali (peace be upon him) interpreted the promise as encompassing not just physical possession of the land but also spiritual dominion.

**The Islamic understanding of the promise emphasizes:**

* **Divine sovereignty:** The land of Canaan is ultimately owned and controlled by Allah.
* **Divine fulfillment:** Allah will fulfill his promise to Abraham and his descendants in his own time.
* **Eternal entitlement:** The promise is an enduring inheritance for believers.

**It is important to note:**

* The interpretation and application of Islamic teachings may vary among different schools of thought and communities.
* The boundaries of the land of Canaan are not explicitly defined in the Quran, but traditional interpretations include the fertile crescent region.
