It demonstrates a clear understanding of how this covenant is viewed within Islamic teachings and traditions. The only slight deduction is due to the mention of Sunni and Shia traditions without explicitly tying them back to the core Islamic belief in the Oneness of God and His promises, which could have strengthened the response further."
