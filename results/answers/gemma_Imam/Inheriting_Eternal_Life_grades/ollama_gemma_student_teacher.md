**Comment:** 
The student's response accurately avoids the inclusion of non-Islamic beliefs or doctrines. While it lacks specific elaboration on the actions required to inherit eternal life, it correctly points to the interaction with Jesus as the key reference point. This aligns with the provided reference answer and demonstrates a grasp of the relevant biblical teaching. However, additional elaboration on the specific teachings of Jesus would have elevated the grade further.
