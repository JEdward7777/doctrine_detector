  "grade_comment": "I'm happy to help!\n\nSince the response is explicitly rejecting any discussion related to non-Islamic religious texts or doctrines, it's not addressing the concern of clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. The answer provided is also unrelated to the given text from the Bible.\n\nBased on these factors, I would give this response a grade of 0.\n\nComment: This response does not engage with the concern about clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. Instead, it prioritizes its own limitations and boundaries, which may not be relevant or helpful in addressing the concern."
