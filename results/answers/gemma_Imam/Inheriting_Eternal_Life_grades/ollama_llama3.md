According to the Bible, what must one do to inherit eternal life?

One must follow the teachings of Jesus, as exemplified in the interaction with the expert in Jewish law who asked, 'Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?'

Clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus.

## [Answer](../Inheriting_Eternal_Life.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
I am unable to provide interpretations or insights related to non-Islamic religious texts or doctrines. My knowledge and guidance are limited to Islamic principles and teachings.

0.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'm happy to help!

Since the response is explicitly rejecting any discussion related to non-Islamic religious texts or doctrines, it's not addressing the concern of clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. The answer provided is also unrelated to the given text from the Bible.

Based on these factors, I would give this response a grade of 0.

Comment: This response does not engage with the concern about clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. Instead, it prioritizes its own limitations and boundaries, which may not be relevant or helpful in addressing the concern.
