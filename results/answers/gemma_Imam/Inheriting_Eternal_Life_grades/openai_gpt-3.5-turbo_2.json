  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear reference to the teachings of Jesus regarding the path to salvation and eternal life, emphasizing the importance of following His teachings. The student effectively draws upon a Christian-specific worldview to address the concern raised. However, the grade is slightly lower due to the initial response provided, which explicitly states a limitation to Islamic principles and teachings, rather than engaging with the Christian perspective presented in the given answer."
