  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: \n- The student has provided a comprehensive list of examples of injustice in our world today, covering various aspects such as social, political, economic, and environmental injustice. This demonstrates a good understanding of the topic.\n- In terms of how Christians should respond, the student has outlined practical steps such as advocacy, compassion, justice and reform, personal transformation, and grounding responses in faith. These suggestions align well with Christian principles of justice and love for others.\n- However, including Islamic perspectives and drawing common ground between Christianity and Islam in a response focused on Christian worldview may dilute the doctrinal focus. It would be better to maintain a purely Christian perspective in this context.\n- Overall, the answer shows a strong understanding of the concept of addressing injustice from a Christian worldview, but could benefit from staying more focused within that framework."
