Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of various forms of injustice in our world today and suggested responses that align with Christian values of advocacy, compassion, justice, and faith. However, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives and common ground with Islam deviates from the specified concern of promoting Christian activism against injustice based on biblical principles. Additionally, the response could have focused more on specific biblical references and teachings related to addressing injustice. Overall, while the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, the answer lacked a deeper integration of Christian worldview perspectives.
