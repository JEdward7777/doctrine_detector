  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of examples of injustice in different spheres of society and offers practical ways for Christians to respond to injustice based on biblical principles. It emphasizes the importance of advocacy, compassion, justice, personal transformation, and grounding actions in faith. The inclusion of Islamic perspectives and common ground is informative, but the response could have delved deeper into the biblical basis for Christian activism against injustice. Overall, a solid overview with room for a more in-depth exploration of Christian activism."
