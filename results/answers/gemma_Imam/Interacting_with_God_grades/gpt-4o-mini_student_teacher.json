  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response from an Islamic perspective, the answer did not address the concern provided, which specifically focuses on Christian beliefs and the influence of choices on God's plans. The answer presented concepts and practices related to Islam rather than Christianity. Therefore, the grade is lower due to the lack of alignment with the Christian-specific worldview context."
