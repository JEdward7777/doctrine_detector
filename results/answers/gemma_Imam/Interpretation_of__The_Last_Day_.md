## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In Christian teaching, 'the last day' refers to the Day of Judgement, when Allah's judgement will be upon the earth.** 

This Day will be a day of great accountability, when every soul will be judged according to their deeds and actions during their lifetime. 

**The Quran shares some similarities with Christian teachings about the Day of Judgement:**

* Belief in the Day of Judgement is fundamental to both Islam and Christianity.
* Both faiths teach that the Day of Judgement will be a day of reckoning and accountability.
* Both faiths teach that the righteous will be rewarded and the wicked will be punished.

**However, there are also significant differences between the Islamic and Christian teachings about the Day of Judgement:**

* **Timing:** The Islamic concept of the Day of Judgement is not explicitly stated in the Quran, while Christianity believes it will occur after the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
* **Nature:** Islamic teaching suggests a more comprehensive judgement encompassing not only actions but also intentions and thoughts.
* **Consequences:** Islamic teaching suggests a wider range of consequences for both the righteous and the wicked, including physical punishments and rewards in the afterlife.

**It is important to note that Muslims and Christians have different interpretations and beliefs about the Day of Judgement, and these interpretations may vary within each faith.**
