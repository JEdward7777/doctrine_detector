  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer provides an in-depth comparison between Islamic and Christian teachings on the Day of Judgement, but it fails to address the Christian perspective specifically as requested in the question. The answer focuses more on Islamic beliefs without adequately addressing the Christian understanding of 'the last day.' It is important to stay focused on the specific worldview provided in the question when discussing theological concepts."
