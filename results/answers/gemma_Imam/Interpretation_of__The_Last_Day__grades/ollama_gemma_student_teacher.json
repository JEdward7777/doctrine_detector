  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian teaching of the Last Day, including its association with judgment and accountability. The student also acknowledges the similarities and differences between Christian and Islamic teachings about the event. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific consequences of judgment in Christianity and from providing more explicit references to relevant biblical passages."
