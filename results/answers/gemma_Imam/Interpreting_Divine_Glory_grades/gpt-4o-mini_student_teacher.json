  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of how 'divine glory' is understood in the context of Islamic worship, focusing on glorification of Allah's attributes, recognizing Allah's majesty, humility, purity of heart and actions, exaltation of Allah's name, motivation for good deeds, and spiritual growth. While the student's response is detailed and well-organized, it is essential to note that the specific concern provided emphasizes the Christian perspective and the nature of divine glory within a Christian worldview. The student's answer does not address this concern adequately, as it does not align closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes the magnificent and radiant nature of God deserving of adoration and worship. Integrating more Christian-specific elements and addressing the concern directly would improve the grade for this response."
