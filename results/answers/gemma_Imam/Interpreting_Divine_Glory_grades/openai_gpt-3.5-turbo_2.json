The focus on humility, purity of heart, exaltation of Allah's name, motivation for good deeds, and spiritual growth align well with Christian principles of recognizing and revering God's glory in worship practices. The only area for improvement would be to incorporate more explicit references to Christian theology or Scriptures, but overall, the response effectively addresses the concern raised."
