The references to Islamic sources add credibility to the response. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note the differences in understanding the nature of God between Islam and Christianity. In Christianity, the term \"Most High\" emphasizes the incomparable superiority and exaltation of God, but it also encompasses the attributes of holiness, righteousness, and love, as revealed through Jesus Christ. A stronger connection could have been made to the Christian understanding of God's nature for a more well-rounded perspective."
