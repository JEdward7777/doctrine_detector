# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic context, the term "high" in "Most High" refers to God's profound greatness, majestic power, and unparalleled sovereignty.**

**The Arabic word "al-alim" (Most High), used in Islamic theology, implies:**

* **Extreme loftiness:** God is far above and beyond any human conception or comparison.
* **Omnipotence:** God's power is unlimited and encompasses all things.
* **Sublime majesty:** God's glory and splendor are beyond human comprehension.

**The concept of God's "height" or "loftiness" is emphasized in various Islamic sources:**

* The Quran: "Say, 'He is Allah, the One, the Ever-Existent, the Self-Subsisting, the Most High (al-alim).'" (Quran 2:255)
* Hadith: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "Allah is al-alimul-alim (the Most High of the Most High)."

**When interpreting the term "high" in the title "Most High," Muslims should understand it as:**

* A declaration of God's unmatched greatness and sovereignty.
* A reminder of God's absolute power and control over all things.
* An invitation to awe and humility before God's immense glory.

**The concept of God's "Most Highness" emphasizes:**

* God's uniqueness and singularity.
* His independence from creation.
* His perfect and eternal nature.

Comment: The response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the Islamic concept of God's "Most High" attribute, emphasizing His greatness, authority, and supremacy over all. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the metaphorical nature of descriptive titles in Islamic theology. The only slight deduction is for minor theological differences between an Islamic and Christian worldview.
