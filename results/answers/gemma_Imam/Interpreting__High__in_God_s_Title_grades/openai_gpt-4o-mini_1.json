  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"Most High\" in the Islamic context, highlighting the attributes of God's greatness, power, and sovereignty as understood in Islamic theology. The focus on the metaphorical and non-physical interpretation of \"high\" aligns with the concern to avoid misconceptions about God's nature. The response effectively addressed the concern and provided a solid Christian worldview evaluation of the Islamic perspective."
