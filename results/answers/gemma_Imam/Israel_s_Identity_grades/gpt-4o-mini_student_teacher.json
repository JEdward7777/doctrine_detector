  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive overview of the significance of the name \"Israel\" in the biblical context, including various interpretations and perspectives, the key point that 'Israel' means 'He struggles with God' as given by God to Jacob is missing. This crucial information is provided in the reference answer from the teacher.\n\nHowever, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the various meanings associated with the name \"Israel\" in the biblical context and has presented the information in a clear and organized manner. They also highlighted the significance of this name in relation to Jacob, the struggle of the nation of Israel, God's chosen people, and its symbolic implications.\n\nOverall, it is a well-researched and well-written response but lacking the specific foundational meaning of the name 'Israel' as outlined in the reference answer."
