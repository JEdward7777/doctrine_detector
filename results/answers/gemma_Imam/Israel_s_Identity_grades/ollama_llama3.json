The answer only scratches the surface by providing a brief definition without delving into the various interpretations or symbolic meanings mentioned in the original passage. To improve, the response could have explored the multiple understandings of the name \"Israel\" within the biblical context, highlighting its connection to Jacob's transformation, God's struggle, and God's chosen people. Additionally, the response did not address the Islamic perspective on the name \"Israel,\" which is relevant to understanding the significance of biblical names and their meanings."
