It effectively connects the name to Jacob's renaming by God and the broader themes of struggle, covenant, and chosenness. The inclusion of an Islamic perspective further enriches the discussion, showing awareness of different religious viewpoints. However, the response could have elaborated more on the connection between the name \"Israel\" and the concept of struggling with God specifically, as highlighted in the given answer."
