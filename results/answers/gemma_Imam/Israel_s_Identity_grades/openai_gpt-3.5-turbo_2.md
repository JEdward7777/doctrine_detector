* This renaming symbolizes the emergence of a new nation and people from Jacob's lineage.

**2. God's Struggle:**

* The name "Israel" also signifies the nation's tumultuous history, likened to the struggle of Jacob with the angel.
* Throughout their journey, the Israelites faced hardship, persecution, and displacement, reflecting the ongoing battle between good and evil.
