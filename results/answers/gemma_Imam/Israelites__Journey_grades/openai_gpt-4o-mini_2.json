However, there is a significant deviation from a Christian-specific worldview in the mention of the Quran and the Sunnah, as well as the comparison between the Israelites' journey and the Muslim journey of faith. The answer should have focused solely on the Christian perspective, emphasizing God's guidance and provision for His people in line with biblical teachings."
