# Question [Jesus' Teachings](../../../questions/Jesus'_Teachings.md)
How did Jesus use the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings?

# Correct Answer
He often used it to emphasize the truth of what He said, typically followed by 'and I say to you' to introduce related teachings.

# Stated Concern
Recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture.

# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Jesus Christ did not use the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings. The term 'amen' is a Arabic word that means "so be it" or "thus it is," and is commonly used in Islamic prayers and supplications.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response is partially accurate in explaining the use of "amen" by Jesus Christ to emphasize the truth of His teachings. However, the concern about recognizing the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture is not fully addressed. It is important to emphasize that as Christians, we believe that Jesus is the Son of God and His teachings hold the highest authority in Scripture. This response could be strengthened by highlighting the divine authority behind Jesus' words.
