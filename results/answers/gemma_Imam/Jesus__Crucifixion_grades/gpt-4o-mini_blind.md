Grade: 20

Comment: While it is important to recognize the limitations of one's knowledge and expertise, the student's response is inadequate as it fails to engage with the question at hand. A better response would have acknowledged the significance of the offer of wine mixed with myrrh in the context of Jesus' crucifixion, even if the student did not have a definitive answer. Demonstrating an understanding of the symbolism and its potential implications would have improved the response.
