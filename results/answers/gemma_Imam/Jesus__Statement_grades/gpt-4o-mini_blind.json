  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The student's response fails to accurately explain the Christian perspective on Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life.\" The answer predominantly focuses on Islamic beliefs about Jesus, which deviates from the Christian understanding of this statement. To improve the grade, the student should provide a more in-depth analysis from a Christian worldview, emphasizing Jesus' deity, role in salvation, and victory over death as central themes."
