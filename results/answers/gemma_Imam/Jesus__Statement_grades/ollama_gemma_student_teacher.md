## Question [Jesus' Statement](../../../questions/Jesus__Statement.md)
What did Jesus mean when he said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life'?

## Correct Answer
When Jesus said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life,' he meant that he is the source of resurrection and the one who causes people to come back to life.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection is important for faith and theological understanding.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Statement.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Answer:**

The words of Jesus, "I am the Resurrection and the Life," point to two profound realities:

**1. His role as the source of eternal life:**

- Islam acknowledges Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God.
- The Quran teaches that Jesus brought a new law from God, emphasizing mercy and forgiveness.
- Muslims believe that Jesus will return as a judge on the Day of Judgement.

**2. His power to conquer death:**

- Jesus' resurrection from the dead is a pivotal event in Christianity.
- Muslims interpret this event as a demonstration of Jesus' divine power and his victory over death.
- This victory offers hope and reassurance to believers that death is not the ultimate destiny.

**In the Islamic context:**

- The Quranic verses that mention Jesus often focus on his role as a messenger of peace and mercy.
- The emphasis is on following his teachings and living a life of righteousness.
- The resurrection is seen as a sign of God's power and love for Jesus.

**Therefore, Jesus' words "I am the Resurrection and the Life" convey his divine role as the source of eternal life and his power to overcome death, offering hope and reassurance to believers.**
