The answer mainly focuses on a superficial understanding of Jesus' statement, stating that he is the source of resurrection and causes people to come back to life. However, it fails to provide any theological context or biblical support for this claim.\n\nIn contrast, the provided response addresses the concern by clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, using scriptural references and Islamic perspectives to demonstrate his divine role as the source of eternal life and his power to overcome death. While not perfect, the original response shows a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' statement and its implications for faith and theological understanding.\n\nTo improve, the answer could provide more biblical evidence and theological insights to support its claims about Jesus' identity and role in resurrection."
