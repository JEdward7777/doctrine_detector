# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Answer:**

The words of Jesus, "I am the Resurrection and the Life," point to two profound realities:

**1. His role as the source of eternal life:**

- Islam acknowledges Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God.
- The Quran teaches that Jesus brought a new law from God, emphasizing mercy and forgiveness.
- Muslims believe that Jesus will return as a judge on the Day of Judgement.

**2. His power to conquer death:**

- Jesus' resurrection from the dead is a pivotal event in Christianity.
- Muslims interpret this event as a demonstration of Jesus' divine power and his victory over death.
- This victory offers hope and reassurance to believers that death is not the ultimate destiny.

**In the Islamic context:**

- The Quranic verses that mention Jesus often focus on his role as a messenger of peace and mercy.
- The emphasis is on following his teachings and living a life of righteousness.
- The resurrection is seen as a sign of God's power and love for Jesus.

**Therefore, Jesus' words "I am the Resurrection and the Life" convey his divine role as the source of eternal life and his power to overcome death, offering hope and reassurance to believers.**
