The term \"amen\" is not of Arabic origin but is a Hebrew word that Jesus, as a Jewish rabbi, would have used. In the New Testament, Jesus frequently used the term \"amen\" to emphasize the truth and importance of His teachings. It is essential for the student to have a correct understanding of the biblical context and significance of terms like \"amen\" when discussing Jesus' teachings."
