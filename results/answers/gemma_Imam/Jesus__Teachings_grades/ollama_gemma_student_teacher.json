  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a limited understanding of the biblical context and fails to provide accurate information regarding Jesus' use of the term \"amen.\" While it is true that the term is commonly used in Islamic prayers, the student's assertion that Jesus never used it is inaccurate. The reference answer correctly points out that Jesus often used \"amen\" to emphasize the truth of his teachings."
