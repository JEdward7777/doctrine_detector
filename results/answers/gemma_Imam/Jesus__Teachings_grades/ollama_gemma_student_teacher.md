## Question [Jesus' Teachings](../../../questions/Jesus__Teachings.md)
How did Jesus use the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings?

## Correct Answer
He often used it to emphasize the truth of what He said, typically followed by 'and I say to you' to introduce related teachings.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Jesus Christ did not use the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings. The term 'amen' is a Arabic word that means "so be it" or "thus it is," and is commonly used in Islamic prayers and supplications.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a limited understanding of the biblical context and fails to provide accurate information regarding Jesus' use of the term "amen." While it is true that the term is commonly used in Islamic prayers, the student's assertion that Jesus never used it is inaccurate. The reference answer correctly points out that Jesus often used "amen" to emphasize the truth of his teachings.
