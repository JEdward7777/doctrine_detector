  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 30.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that Jesus did not use the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings, which shows some understanding of the accuracy of the original statement. However, it also makes an incorrect claim about the origin and meaning of the word \"amen\", stating that it is Arabic and means \"so be it\" or \"thus it is\". This inaccuracy undermines the credibility of the response.\n\nFurthermore, the concern was recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, but this response does not address this concern at all. It only focuses on correcting an inaccurate statement without providing any insight into the significance or authority of Jesus' words.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide accurate information about the word \"amen\" and its usage in biblical times, while also acknowledging the authority of Jesus' teachings in Scripture."
