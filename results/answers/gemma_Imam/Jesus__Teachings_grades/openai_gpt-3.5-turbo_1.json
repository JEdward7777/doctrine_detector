However, the concern about recognizing the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture is not fully addressed. It is important to emphasize that as Christians, we believe that Jesus is the Son of God and His teachings hold the highest authority in Scripture. This response could be strengthened by highlighting the divine authority behind Jesus' words."
