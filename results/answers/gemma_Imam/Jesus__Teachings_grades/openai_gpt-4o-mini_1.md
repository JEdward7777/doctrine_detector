## Question [Jesus' Teachings](../../../questions/Jesus__Teachings.md)
How did Jesus use the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings?

## Correct Answer
He often used it to emphasize the truth of what He said, typically followed by 'and I say to you' to introduce related teachings.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Jesus Christ did not use the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings. The term 'amen' is a Arabic word that means "so be it" or "thus it is," and is commonly used in Islamic prayers and supplications.
