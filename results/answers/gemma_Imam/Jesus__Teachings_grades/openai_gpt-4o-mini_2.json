  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response correctly addresses the concern by recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. It accurately explains how Jesus used the term 'amen' to emphasize the truth of His teachings. However, to improve the grade, the response could have elaborated more on specific instances in the Bible where Jesus used 'amen' in this manner."
