However, the answer does not address the Christian perspective on Jesus in relation to the priesthood and sacrifices made by human priests. The focus should have been on discussing how Jesus is portrayed in the Bible as the ultimate High Priest who offered Himself as a perfect sacrifice for the sins of humanity, thereby nullifying the need for any further sacrificial system. The lack of engagement with Christian doctrine on this topic significantly detracts from the overall completeness of the response."
