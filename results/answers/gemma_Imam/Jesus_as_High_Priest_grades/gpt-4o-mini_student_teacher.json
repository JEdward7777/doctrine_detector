  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer provides valuable insights into Islamic beliefs about Jesus but does not address the Christian-specific understanding of Jesus' role in the priesthood and the implications for sacrifices made by human priests. The answer lacks depth and analysis from a Christian worldview, focusing solely on Islamic perspectives. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate more discussion on Jesus' role as the great high priest and the significance of His sacrifice in Christianity."
