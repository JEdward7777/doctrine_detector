It clearly explains the Islamic rejection of human priesthood and sacrifices, highlighting the emphasis on monotheism and the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate atonement for sin. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the biblical basis for the claims made regarding Jesus as the great high priest and the fulfillment of sacrificial needs through his sacrifice."
