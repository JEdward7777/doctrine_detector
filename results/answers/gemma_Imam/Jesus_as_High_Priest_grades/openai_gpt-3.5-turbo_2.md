## Question [Jesus as High Priest](../../../questions/Jesus_as_High_Priest.md)
How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

Jesus is referred to as our 'great high priest' who intercedes for us in God's presence and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, meaning that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus' Mention in Islamic Tradition:**

In Islamic tradition, Jesus (Isa) is mentioned as a prophet of God, but not as a priest or one who offered sacrifices. The Islamic belief system emphasizes monotheism and rejects the concept of human priesthood and sacrifices.

**Jesus' Role as a Prophet:**

- Jesus is believed to be a messenger of God, sent with a divine message and teachings.
- His mission was to convey God's love and mercy, and to guide people towards righteousness.
- He performed miracles and taught about the kingdom of God.

**Islamic Concepts of Priesthood and Sacrifice:**

- In Islam, priesthood is not attributed to individuals but to Allah alone.
- The Islamic concept of priesthood emphasizes the oneness of Allah and the need for purity of heart and intention in all actions.
- Sacrifices are not considered necessary for forgiveness of sins or to appease Allah.

**Implications for Sacrifices Made by Human Priests:**

The rejection of human priesthood and sacrifices in Islam means that these practices are not recognized or permitted in Islamic tradition. Islamic teachings emphasize monotheism and the futility of human rituals and sacrifices in achieving salvation or divine favor.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided represents a Christian understanding of Jesus as the great high priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. However, the response does not engage with the concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood in addressing the Islamic perspective presented. It lacks a comparison or evaluation of the two viewpoints from a Christian perspective, resulting in a limited analysis of the significance of Jesus' priesthood. Further development and integration of Christian theological insights into the comparison with Islamic beliefs would strengthen the response.
