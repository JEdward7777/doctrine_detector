It disregards the significance of Jesus' role as the ultimate high priest who offered himself as a sacrifice for sin, which is a central tenet of Christian belief. In Christianity, Jesus' priesthood and sacrifice are of paramount importance for salvation, and any worldview that does not acknowledge this fundamental truth would not be compatible with Christian teachings."
