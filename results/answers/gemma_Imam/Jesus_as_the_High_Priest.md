## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to the New Testament, Jesus is not considered to be a high priest in the traditional sense.** The New Testament presents Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice and mediator between God and humanity, rather than a ceremonial or ritualistic priesthood.

However, there are parallels drawn between Jesus and the high priesthood in certain contexts. For example:

* **Jesus is described as the "great high priest" (Hebrews 4:14)**, who offers himself as a perfect and complete sacrifice for sins.
* **His sacrifice is seen as a fulfillment of the ancient prophecies about the Messiah** (Psalm 22:1-3).
* **Jesus' priesthood is characterized by compassion, forgiveness, and accessibility to God** (Matthew 11:28).

**The New Testament emphasizes that Jesus' priesthood is universal and inclusive**, offering salvation and reconciliation to all people, regardless of their background or religious practices.
