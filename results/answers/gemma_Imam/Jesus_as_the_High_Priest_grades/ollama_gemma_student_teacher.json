  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the relationship between Jesus and the high priesthood in the New Testament. \nThe student correctly points out that Jesus is not considered a traditional high priest but highlights the parallels between his ministry and the high priesthood. \nThe student also provides relevant textual references to support their claims. \nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of Jesus' universal priesthood and its implications for reconciliation and salvation."
