  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not effectively address the concern raised about clarity in differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The response provided predominantly emphasizes Islamic beliefs and lacks a clear distinction between the authority of Jesus as Lord and the titles given to earthly political leaders. The suggested ways to communicate the phrase fall short of explicitly highlighting Jesus' unique divine authority. A stronger Christian-specific perspective needed to be integrated into the answer to align with the concern raised."
