  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the theological concept of lordship and its distinction from political authority. The explanation clearly articulates the Islamic perspective on monotheism and Jesus' role as a messenger of Allah. The suggested ways to communicate the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" effectively differentiate between spiritual lordship and earthly titles. The overall clarity and theological accuracy of the response merit a high grade."
