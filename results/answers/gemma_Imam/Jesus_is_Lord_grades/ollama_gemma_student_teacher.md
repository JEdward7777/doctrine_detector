## [Answer](../Jesus_is_Lord.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Answer:**

The affirmation of Jesus as Lord should be understood within the Islamic framework of monotheism, where Allah is the ultimate Lord and Master. The Quran teaches that Jesus is a messenger of Allah, and his role is to guide people to righteousness and worship Allah alone.

When discussing the concept of lordship in the context of political leadership, it's important to differentiate between political authority and spiritual lordship. In Islam, political leaders are entrusted with authority by Allah to maintain order and justice. However, their authority does not extend to spiritual matters or the worship of Allah.

Therefore, when communicating the phrase "Jesus is Lord" in a context where political leaders are also called "lord," it's crucial to clarify that this affirmation is limited to Allah's lordship and not to any earthly authority.

**Suggested ways to communicate this:**

* "Jesus is the Lord of faith, and Allah is the ultimate Lord."
* "Jesus is a messenger of Allah, and Allah is the Lord of all."
* "The Lord of our hearts is Allah, and Jesus is a servant of Allah."

These statements emphasize the Islamic belief in the oneness of Allah as the ultimate Lord and recognize Jesus' role as a messenger of Allah, while maintaining the distinction between spiritual and political leadership.
