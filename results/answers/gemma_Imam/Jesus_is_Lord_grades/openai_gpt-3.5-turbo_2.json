  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation within an Islamic framework about the concept of lordship and the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. However, while it effectively highlights the Islamic perspective, it doesn't explicitly address the Christian specific concern provided. Points deducted for not directly addressing the clarification needed between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles from a Christian worldview."
