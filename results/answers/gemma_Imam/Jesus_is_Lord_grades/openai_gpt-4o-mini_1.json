However, the suggested ways to communicate the concept lacked a direct emphasis on Jesus' divine authority and supremacy over all creation. While the response did address the concern by highlighting the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles, it could have more explicitly emphasized Jesus' unique and divine status as Lord."
