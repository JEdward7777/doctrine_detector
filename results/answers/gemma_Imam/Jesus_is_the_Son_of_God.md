## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Target answer from notes
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Concern to grade by
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The concept of Jesus being the Son of God is not compatible with Islamic beliefs. In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but not in the same way as the Son of God as understood in Christianity.
