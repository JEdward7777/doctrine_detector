  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student correctly acknowledges the difference in beliefs between Christianity and Islam regarding Jesus being the Son of God. However, the answer falls short in providing a translation that maintains the original terminology and offers clear teaching and context to explain its meaning. The student's response could have been improved by attempting to explain the concept of Jesus as the Son of God in a way that respects Islamic beliefs while still accurately representing the Christian perspective."
