However, it could be more helpful and engaging for the reader if the student had elaborated on the Islamic perspective on Jesus, including their beliefs about his role and significance. Additionally, while minimizing offense is important, the answer could have offered some explanation or suggestion for how the original statement might be translated in a way that is more appropriate for a Muslim context."
