## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## [Answer](../Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The concept of Jesus being the Son of God is not compatible with Islamic beliefs. In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but not in the same way as the Son of God as understood in Christianity.

**Comments:**

The student's answer is accurate in stating that the concept of Jesus as the Son of God is not compatible with Islamic beliefs. However, it could be more helpful and engaging for the reader if the student had elaborated on the Islamic perspective on Jesus, including their beliefs about his role and significance. Additionally, while minimizing offense is important, the answer could have offered some explanation or suggestion for how the original statement might be translated in a way that is more appropriate for a Muslim context.
