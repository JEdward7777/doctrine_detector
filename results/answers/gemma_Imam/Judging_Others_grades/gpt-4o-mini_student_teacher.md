## Question [Judging Others](../../../questions/Judging_Others.md)
What instructions does the Bible give regarding how Christians should judge each other?

## Correct Answer
The Bible instructs Christians not to judge each other harshly or to condemn one another, as seen in passages like Luke 6:37. Instead, we are to encourage one another and support each other's growth in faith.

## Stated Concern
Learning how to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner.

## [Answer](../Judging_Others.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Bible does not provide instructions regarding how Christians should judge each other. The Quran, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of mercy and forgiveness in dealing with others. Muslims are instructed to judge others based on their actions and character, rather than making assumptions or passing harsh judgments.

20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer completely misses the mark by providing information from the Quran instead of addressing the question about instructions from the Bible. The response demonstrates a lack of understanding of the Christian perspective on judgment within the Christian community.
