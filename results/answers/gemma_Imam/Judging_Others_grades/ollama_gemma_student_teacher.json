  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer correctly acknowledges that the Bible does not explicitly provide instructions on how Christians should judge each other. However, it incorrectly suggests that the Quran emphasizes mercy and forgiveness, while the concern is specifically related to a Christian worldview. The student's response also lacks clarity regarding the specific instructions given in the Bible regarding judging others. The reference answer provides a more accurate and relevant interpretation of the biblical perspective on judging others."
