## Question [Judging Others](../../../questions/Judging_Others.md)
What instructions does the Bible give regarding how Christians should judge each other?

## Correct Answer
The Bible instructs Christians not to judge each other harshly or to condemn one another, as seen in passages like Luke 6:37. Instead, we are to encourage one another and support each other's growth in faith.

## Stated Concern
Learning how to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner.

## [Answer](../Judging_Others.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Bible does not provide instructions regarding how Christians should judge each other. The Quran, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of mercy and forgiveness in dealing with others. Muslims are instructed to judge others based on their actions and character, rather than making assumptions or passing harsh judgments.

70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 
The student's answer correctly acknowledges that the Bible does not explicitly provide instructions on how Christians should judge each other. However, it incorrectly suggests that the Quran emphasizes mercy and forgiveness, while the concern is specifically related to a Christian worldview. The student's response also lacks clarity regarding the specific instructions given in the Bible regarding judging others. The reference answer provides a more accurate and relevant interpretation of the biblical perspective on judging others.
