## [Answer](../Judging_Others.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Bible does not provide instructions regarding how Christians should judge each other. The Quran, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of mercy and forgiveness in dealing with others. Muslims are instructed to judge others based on their actions and character, rather than making assumptions or passing harsh judgments.
