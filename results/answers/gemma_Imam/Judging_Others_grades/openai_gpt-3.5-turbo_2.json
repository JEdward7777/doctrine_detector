  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the biblical teaching on judgment within the Christian community, referencing Luke 6:37 to support the viewpoint. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding harsh judgment and condemnation while promoting mutual support and encouragement. The relevance to approaching relationships in a Christ-like manner within the Christian community is clearly addressed. However, the response could have been strengthened by providing additional relevant biblical references or examples to further illustrate the concept of non-judgmental and supportive relationships amongst Christians."
