Comments: The response acknowledges the limitations of the student's knowledge and expertise regarding biblical perspectives, which is commendable. However, it could have been improved by briefly mentioning that individuals will be judged based on their beliefs and actions according to Christianity, even though the specific details may vary between religions. Encouraging consultation with Christian scholars or religious leaders was a good suggestion.
