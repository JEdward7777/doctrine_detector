## Grade by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the biblical perspective on judgment, but it lacks specific references or interpretations from the Bible. It would benefit from further elaboration on the concept of righteousness and its relevance to judgment according to Christian teachings.
