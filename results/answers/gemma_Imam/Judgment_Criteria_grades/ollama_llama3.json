However, by acknowledging the need to consult reputable Christian scholars or leaders for biblical interpretations and providing a gentle nudge towards considering one's actions in relation to Christ's righteous character, this response shows an effort to engage with the concern. The tone is humble and respectful, which aligns with a Christian worldview.
