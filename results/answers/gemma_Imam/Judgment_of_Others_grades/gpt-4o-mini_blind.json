The student effectively incorporates relevant Bible verses and presents a well-rounded perspective on the topic. The emphasis on humility, compassion, self-awareness, empathy, improvement, guidance, forgiveness, and the Golden Rule aligns well with Christian teachings. There is a strong connection made between Jesus' teachings and the practical application of those teachings in interpersonal relationships. Great work overall!"
