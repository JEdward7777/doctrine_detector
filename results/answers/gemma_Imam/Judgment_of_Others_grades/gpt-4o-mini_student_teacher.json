  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of Jesus' teachings on pointing out the faults of others in relation to our own faults. They effectively highlighted the importance of humility, self-awareness, compassion, empathy, focusing on personal improvement, guidance, forgiveness, and the Golden Rule in this context. The answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. However, the student could have directly referenced Luke 6:41-42 to strengthen their response. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful answer."
