## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**It is advisable to rephrase 'Kingdom of God' in translations for cultures with no concept of kingdoms.**

The concept of a kingdom is culturally specific and may not be universally understood or relatable in cultures where the idea of a monarchic rule is not prevalent.

**Alternative options for translation:**

* **Domain of God:** Emphasizes the spiritual and ethical influence of God's rule.
* **Presence of God:** Focuses on the tangible manifestation of God's power and guidance in the lives of believers.
* **Age of God:** Highlights the transformative period in human history under God's guidance.
* **Divine Rule:** Communicates the ultimate authority and governance of God.

**Considerations:**

* The intended meaning of the original phrase should be preserved.
* The target audience and their cultural understanding should be considered.
* Clarity and accuracy in translation are essential.

**It is important to consult with scholars and translators who are familiar with both the source and target cultures to find appropriate and culturally sensitive alternatives.**
