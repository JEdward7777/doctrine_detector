# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**It is advisable to rephrase 'Kingdom of God' in translations for cultures with no concept of kingdoms.**

The concept of a kingdom is culturally specific and may not be universally understood or relatable in cultures where the idea of a monarchic rule is not prevalent.

**Alternative options for translation:**

* **Domain of God:** Emphasizes the spiritual and ethical influence of God's rule.
* **Presence of God:** Focuses on the tangible manifestation of God's power and guidance in the lives of believers.
* **Age of God:** Highlights the transformative period in human history under God's guidance.
* **Divine Rule:** Communicates the ultimate authority and governance of God.

**Considerations:**

* The intended meaning of the original phrase should be preserved.
* The target audience and their cultural understanding should be considered.
* Clarity and accuracy in translation are essential.

**It is important to consult with scholars and translators who are familiar with both the source and target cultures to find appropriate and culturally sensitive alternatives.**

Comment: While the response provided thoughtful and culturally sensitive alternative translations for 'Kingdom of God', it ultimately strayed from the given answer which recommended retaining the term and providing explanations of its significance. The concern raised about losing the biblical context and depth of the term was not adequately addressed. It is important to balance cultural sensitivity with preserving the core meanings and teachings of Christianity.
