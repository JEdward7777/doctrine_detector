  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer addresses the importance of the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" from a Muslim perspective and provides insights into historical, cultural, translational, and unity aspects. However, the response lacks a Christian-specific interpretation and does not directly address the theological implications related to God's reign in the book of Matthew. The answer could be strengthened by incorporating more Christian worldview perspectives and delving deeper into the unique theological significance of the term \"heaven\" in this context."
