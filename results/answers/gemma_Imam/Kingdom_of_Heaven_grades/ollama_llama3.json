  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30%\n\nComment: The response does not directly address the concern about understanding unique terminology used in the gospels, which is the primary focus of the given answer. Instead, it presents a comparative analysis between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding an afterlife, while discussing the historical and cultural context of the term \"heaven\" in Matthew's gospel.\n\nThe response fails to demonstrate a clear understanding of the theological implications of using \"heaven\" specifically in the Gospel of Matthew, as mentioned in the given answer. The comparison with Islamic beliefs, although interesting, is not directly relevant to the concern or the given answer.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response should focus more on analyzing the unique terminology used in Matthew's gospel and its theological implications, rather than presenting a broader comparative analysis between religions."
