However, it does not directly address the concern of understanding the unique terminology in the gospels and how it impacts the theological implications of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven.\" More explicit integration of this concern and a deeper exploration of the Christian worldview would enhance the response."
