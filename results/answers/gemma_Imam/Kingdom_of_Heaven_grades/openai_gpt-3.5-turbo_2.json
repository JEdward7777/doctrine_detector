The integration of historical, cultural, and translational considerations helped support the argument. However, the response lacked a direct engagement with the specific Christian theological implications mentioned in the provided answer. Further elaboration on how the term \"heaven\" conveys God's reign in a Christian worldview could have strengthened the overall argument."
