**Translational Considerations:**

* The translation of "heaven" in the phrase "kingdom of heaven" is a matter of interpretation and cultural sensitivity.
* Maintaining the English term "heaven" preserves the original language of the text and conveys the intended meaning.

Comment:
The response did a good job in addressing the concern by acknowledging the significance of retaining the term "heaven" in the phrase "kingdom of heaven" within the context of Matthew's gospel. The integration of historical, cultural, and translational considerations helped support the argument. However, the response lacked a direct engagement with the specific Christian theological implications mentioned in the provided answer. Further elaboration on how the term "heaven" conveys God's reign in a Christian worldview could have strengthened the overall argument.
