However, it does not directly address the concern about understanding the unique terminology in the gospels and how it helps in grasping the intended messages of the biblical authors. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the significance of retaining \"heaven\" in the \"kingdom of heaven\" to understanding the theological implications of God's reign in the gospels."
