## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of believers meeting together for prayer and scripture study to foster local fellowship. The deduction in points is due to the initial response challenging the premise based on a Christian worldview, which was not entirely relevant in this context of encouraging fellowship among believers.
