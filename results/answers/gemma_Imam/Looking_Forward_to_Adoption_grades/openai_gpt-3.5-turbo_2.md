**Meaning for Believers:**

- **Assurance of Acceptance:** The promise of adoption assures believers that they are loved and accepted by God.
- **Hope for Glory:** The waiting period encourages believers to persevere in faith, knowing that their ultimate destiny is to share in God's glory.
- **Identity Transformation:** As adopted sons, believers receive a new identity and purpose in Christ.
- **Participation in God's Family:** The adoption process symbolizes believers becoming part of God's family, with all the rights and responsibilities that come with it.

**Implications:**

- Believers should patiently endure trials and tribulations, knowing that their ultimate reward is the privilege of being God's sons.
- They should persevere in faith, knowing that God's love and acceptance are unwavering.
- They should embrace their new identity in Christ and live lives worthy of their calling.
