## [Answer](../Lord_s_Supper_Definition.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The Lord's Supper commemorates the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is believed to be the Messiah and the Son of God in Christianity.** Muslims do not believe in Jesus as a deity, but they recognize his significance as a prophet and messenger of God.

**The event is significant because:**

* It symbolizes the immense love and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who willingly gave his life for the sins of humanity.
* It represents the new covenant between God and humanity, established through Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection.
* It is a reminder of the importance of humility, forgiveness, and love in the Muslim faith.

**The Quran does not explicitly mention the Lord's Supper, but Islamic traditions and interpretations recognize its significance as a Christian ritual.** Muslims are encouraged to respect the beliefs and practices of other faiths.
