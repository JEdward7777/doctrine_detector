However, the discussion on Islamic perspectives and the mention of the Quran's lack of reference to the Lord's Supper, while informative, slightly deviates from the original concern of understanding the Christian significance of the Lord's Supper. More focus on biblical references and theological implications within Christianity would strengthen the response."
