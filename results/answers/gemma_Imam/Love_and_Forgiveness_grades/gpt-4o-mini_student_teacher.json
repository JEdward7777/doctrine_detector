  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of forgiveness in both Islamic and biblical contexts, emphasizing its importance in loving others. The response effectively highlights the link between forgiveness, compassion, and peace in relationships. However, the student could strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting forgiveness as a reflection of God's love in daily interactions, as outlined in the reference concern. Overall, a well-written and insightful response deserving of a solid grade."
