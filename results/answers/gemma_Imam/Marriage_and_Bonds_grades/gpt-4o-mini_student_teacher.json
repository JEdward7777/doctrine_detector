  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-articulated explanation of the significance of the 'bond of marriage' from a Christian perspective, as well as the responsibilities and commitments that Christian couples should uphold in their marriage. The answer aligns closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, but the student's response could have been more concise and focused specifically on the core aspect of the 'bond of marriage' as a sacred commitment established by God. Overall, a strong understanding of Christian marriage principles is demonstrated in the answer."
