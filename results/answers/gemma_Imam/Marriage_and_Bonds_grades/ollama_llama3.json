  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response accurately reflects the Christian perspective on marriage, emphasizing its sacred nature, mutual support, and importance in honoring God's design for relationships. The provided biblical references and specific commitments expected of Christian couples (mutual responsibility, loyalty, communication, compromise, and humility) demonstrate a thorough understanding of the topic. Additionally, the goals of marriage listed (to glorify God, establish a stable home, provide companionship, raise children, and live out Christian values) are all in line with promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages.\n\nThe only aspect that prevents me from giving this response a perfect score is that it does not explicitly state the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation within marriage, which is an essential element of Christ-centered relationships."
