## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The names of the twelve disciples are not explicitly listed in the books of the Bible that are considered canonical by Muslims. Muslims follow the Quran and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad as their religious texts, and their beliefs and practices are based on those sources.

Grade: 40

Comment: The student's response accurately acknowledges that the names of the twelve disciples are not explicitly listed in Islamic religious texts. However, the answer does not provide information on where in the Christian Bible the names are actually listed, which was the focus of the question. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to mention that the twelve disciples are listed in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Acts.
