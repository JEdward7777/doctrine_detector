Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer does not address the question regarding where the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the Bible. In a Christian worldview context, understanding the specific teachings and accounts in the Gospels is crucial for knowing where information such as the names of the disciples can be found. The answer provided by the student is unrelated and does not demonstrate knowledge of the Christian scripture.
