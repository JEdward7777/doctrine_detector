## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The names of the twelve disciples are not explicitly listed in the books of the Bible that are considered canonical by Muslims. Muslims follow the Quran and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad as their religious texts, and their beliefs and practices are based on those sources.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 60

**Comment:** The student demonstrates a partial understanding of the biblical texts relevant to the question. However, their response is inaccurate as it contradicts the canonical scriptures of Christianity. The student's answer should have referenced the Gospel accounts as the primary sources for the listing of the twelve disciples' names.
