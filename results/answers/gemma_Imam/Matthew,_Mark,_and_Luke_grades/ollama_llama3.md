The names of the twelve disciples are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings.

## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The names of the twelve disciples are not explicitly listed in the books of the Bible that are considered canonical by Muslims. Muslims follow the Quran and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad as their religious texts, and their beliefs and practices are based on those sources.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
20.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 20.

This response does not address the concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, as it provides no information about the disciples or their roles in the early Christian church. The response also inaccurately states that the names of the twelve disciples are not listed in the Bible, which is actually true for only one book (John). Additionally, while it is true that Muslims have their own religious texts and beliefs, this has no relevance to the question about the disciples.

A more relevant and accurate response might be: "The names of the twelve disciples are explicitly listed in the books of Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:13-16, and Acts 1:13."
