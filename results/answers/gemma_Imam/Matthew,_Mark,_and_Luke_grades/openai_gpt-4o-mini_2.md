## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The names of the twelve disciples are not explicitly listed in the books of the Bible that are considered canonical by Muslims. Muslims follow the Quran and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad as their religious texts, and their beliefs and practices are based on those sources.
