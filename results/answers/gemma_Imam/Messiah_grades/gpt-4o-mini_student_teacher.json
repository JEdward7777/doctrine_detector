  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of the Messiah in Islam and did a good job highlighting the differences and commonalities with other religious expectations of a savior figure. However, the answer lacked a clear teaching on the biblical understanding of the term 'Messiah' and how Jesus uniquely fulfills Old Testament prophecies as the ultimate savior. To improve the grade, the student should have linked the discussion back to Jesus as the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and emphasized His sacrificial role in providing salvation for humanity."
