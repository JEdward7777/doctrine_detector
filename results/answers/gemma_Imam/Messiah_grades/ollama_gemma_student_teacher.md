## [Answer](../Messiah.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Explanation of the Messianic Figure in Islam:**

The concept of the Messiah (Isa) in Islam shares similarities with other religions, yet carries its own unique interpretation.

**In Islamic belief:**

* The Messiah is a prophet and messenger of Allah, who will bring salvation and peace to the world.
* He is expected to be born of a virgin, Mary (Maryam), and will perform miracles.
* His mission is to preach monotheism, establish justice, and prepare the way for the Day of Judgement.

**Reconciling Different Religious Expectations:**

While Islamic expectations of the Messiah align with certain universal notions of a savior figure, there are key differences from other religions:

* **Nature of salvation:** In Islam, salvation is primarily through faith in Allah and adherence to Islamic law (shariah), not through the Messiah's physical presence or sacrifice.
* **Divine sonship:** Islam rejects the concept of the Messiah as the son of Allah, upholding the principle of monotheism.
* **Focus on justice:** The Islamic Messiah's primary mission is to establish justice and ethical values, rather than primarily focusing on spiritual redemption.

**Common Ground with Other Religions:**

Despite the differences in specific beliefs, there is common ground between Islamic and other religious expectations of a savior figure:

* **Humanity's need for redemption:** All religions recognize the need for salvation or redemption from suffering, injustice, and mortality.
* **Compassion and forgiveness:** The Messiah is expected to bring compassion and forgiveness to the world.
* **Establishment of peace:** The ultimate goal of the Messiah's mission is to establish peace and harmony.

**Conclusion:**

The Islamic concept of the Messiah emphasizes the importance of faith in Allah, upholding justice, and establishing peace. While there are variations in beliefs compared to other religions, the underlying notions of salvation and redemption share similarities, highlighting the common spiritual aspirations of humanity.
