While it mentions King David, it does not connect this to the fulfillment of prophecy or the significance of Jesus' kingship in relation to his mission. The response also does not address the symbolic significance of the title or its implications for understanding Jesus' messianic role. Overall, while the response touches on some key aspects of Jesus' identity as Messiah, it does not provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of this aspect of Christian theology.\n\nConcerned about: Understanding Jesus' messianic role is central to the Christian faith.\n\nReasoning:\nThe concern is that understanding Jesus' messianic role is central to the Christian faith.
