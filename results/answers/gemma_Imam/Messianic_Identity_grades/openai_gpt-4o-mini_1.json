It highlights the fulfillment of prophecies, the divine authority of Jesus, the fulfillment of Messianic expectations, the symbolic significance of the title, and how it aligns with God's plan of salvation. The response effectively addresses the concern that understanding Jesus' messianic role is central to the Christian faith by connecting the title to Jesus as the promised Messiah and descendant of King David with an emphasis on his eternal reign. Well done!"
