  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-written and informative about Islamic perspectives on serving others, does not directly address the biblical definition of ministry as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The biblical perspective emphasizes serving others by teaching them about God and caring for their spiritual and physical needs, which was missing in the student's response. It is important to directly address the specific concern of understanding the biblical definition of ministry in order to effectively communicate the Christian worldview on this topic."
