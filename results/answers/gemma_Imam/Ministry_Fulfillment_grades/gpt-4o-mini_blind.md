## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student correctly acknowledged their limitations in providing religious guidance as a non-Christian, which is commendable. However, as the question specifically asked about fulfilling ministry as a Christian, the response could have briefly acknowledged basic Christian beliefs on ministry, such as serving others in accordance with God's will.
