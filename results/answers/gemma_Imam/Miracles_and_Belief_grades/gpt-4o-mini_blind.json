  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and well-organized explanation of how miracles function as signs that lead to belief in God from a Christian perspective. The points are supported with relevant examples and scriptural references, demonstrating a strong understanding of the theological significance of miracles in reinforcing belief in God. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie each point back to the foundational aspect of miracles as signs pointing to the existence and nature of God. Overall, an excellent response."
