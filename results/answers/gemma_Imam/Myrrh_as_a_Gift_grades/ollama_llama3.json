While this may be relevant from a historical or cultural perspective, it does not contribute to deepening one's appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission. The provided answer also does not directly relate to myrrh as a symbol of Jesus' suffering and death, which is the main concern. A more effective response would have explored the biblical significance of myrrh in relation to Jesus' mission and sacrifice."
