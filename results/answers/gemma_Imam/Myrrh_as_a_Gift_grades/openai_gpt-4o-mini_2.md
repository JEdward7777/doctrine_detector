Comment: This response accurately explains the significance of myrrh as a gift given to Jesus at his birth, highlighting its symbolism related to his future suffering and sacrifice for humanity's sins. Understanding this symbolism indeed deepens appreciation for Jesus' purpose and mission. The deduction is due to the initial response not directly addressing the concern raised about the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus, as well as lacking a Christian specific worldview in your own response.
