  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 20.\n\nThis response does not address the concern or provide insights into Christian beliefs about eternity. The Imam's statement about being unable to provide interpretations on Christian doctrines is valid, but it doesn't contribute to understanding the concept of eternity in a Christian context. The provided answer about eternity does not seem to be connected to the concern or the topic at hand.\n\nComment: While the response is respectful and acknowledges the limitations of the Imam's knowledge, it does not engage with the concern or provide any meaningful insights into Christian beliefs about eternity."
