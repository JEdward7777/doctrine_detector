Comment: The response from the Muslim Imam accurately acknowledges the limitations of their knowledge and expertise in providing interpretations on Christian beliefs. However, the concern raised about the importance of understanding eternity in Christianity is valid within a Christian worldview. The Imam's response, while respectful and clear in its limitation, does not directly address the specific concern raised about the concept of eternity in Christian faith.
