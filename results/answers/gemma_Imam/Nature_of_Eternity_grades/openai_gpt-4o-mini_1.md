Comment: The response provided by the Muslim Imam accurately acknowledges the limitation of their expertise in Christian beliefs and doctrines. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, understanding the concept of eternity is indeed crucial for deepening one's faith and making informed choices. Therefore, while the acknowledgement of limitation is appreciated, the response falls short in addressing the importance of grasping the concept of eternity for Christians.
