  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-structured and detailed, completely misses the mark on the concern of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner. The perspective given is from a Muslim Imam, which does not align with the Christian specific worldview required for this question. The focus on Quranic principles and seeking guidance from the Quran does not address how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament. Additionally, there is a lack of emphasis on the central teaching of exhorting in love, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student should have provided a Christian-specific perspective on exhortation in line with the concern provided."
