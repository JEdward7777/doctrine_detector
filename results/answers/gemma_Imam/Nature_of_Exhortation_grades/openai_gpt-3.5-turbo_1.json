While these principles are valuable and align with Christian values to an extent, the response could have connected them more directly to the Christian context and Scriptures. The emphasis on seeking divine inspiration and delivering exhortation in love aligns well with Christian teachings on the importance of speaking the truth in love. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern of ensuring encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner."
