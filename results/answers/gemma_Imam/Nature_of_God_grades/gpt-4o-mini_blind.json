  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: While the student provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on God's spiritual nature and its influence on worship, the response misses the mark in addressing the Christian-specific aspect of the question. The answer should have focused on Jesus' statement in the context of Christianity, rather than Islamic beliefs and interpretations. Additionally, it is crucial to emphasize the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and how God being spirit impacts Christian worship, which was not explored in the response. The lack of integration of Christian teachings results in a lower grade."
