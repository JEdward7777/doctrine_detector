Comment: The student's response is neutral and objective, which is commendable, but it lacks a direct answer to the question about what 'judgment day' means in a Christian context according to the Bible. It would have been more helpful to provide a summary or explanation in addition to directing the reader to consult reliable sources within the Christian community.
