Grade: 50

Comment: While it is respectful for the student to acknowledge their limitations based on their Islamic teachings, it is important for all students to be aware of and knowledgeable about other religious beliefs, including those of Christianity. In this case, a better response would have been to simply state that they do not have information regarding the appearance and taste of manna as described in the Bible.
