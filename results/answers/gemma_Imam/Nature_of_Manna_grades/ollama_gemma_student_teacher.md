## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical description of manna's appearance and taste. However, the response lacks specificity in referencing the relevant scriptures or passages that describe these characteristics. Additionally, while the student's knowledge base is limited to Islamic teachings, a Christian specific worldview would suggest exploring the biblical accounts of manna for the desired information.
