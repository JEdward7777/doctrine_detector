Comment: While it is understandable that the responder's knowledge is predominantly based on Islamic teachings, the concern about understanding the miraculous provision of God in the context of Manna does not directly conflict with Islamic beliefs. It would have been more beneficial for the responder to make an attempt to provide a general or comparative perspective on miraculous provision across different faith traditions.
