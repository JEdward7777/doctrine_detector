- This revealed his immense compassion and concern for the well-being of others.

**5. Precursor to the afterlife:**
- Jesus' resurrection, one of his most significant miracles, foreshadowed his victory over death and the promise of eternal life for believers.

**The Quran and Sunnah provide accounts of some of Jesus' miracles, including:**

- Healing the blind and the deaf
- Calming the storm
- Turning water into wine

Grade: 50

Comment: The student provided a detailed and well-organized explanation of the miracles performed by Jesus from an Islamic perspective, highlighting the significance of these miracles in affirming Jesus' special role. However, the answer does not directly address the Christian specific worldview concern of understanding Jesus's miracles as affirmations of His divine nature. The student does acknowledge Jesus as the Son of God, but the emphasis on Allah's power and the Islamic understanding of Jesus' identity detracts from the Christian perspective that Jesus is God incarnate and the Messiah. The response does not align closely enough with the Christian specific worldview presented in the reference answer.
