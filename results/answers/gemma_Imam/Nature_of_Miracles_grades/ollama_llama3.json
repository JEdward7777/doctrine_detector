  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive discussion of the significance of Jesus' miracles in affirming His divine nature, which aligns with the concern. The author effectively explains how the miracles demonstrate Allah's power and sovereignty, Jesus' special status, authenticity of his message, compassion and mercy, and precursor to the afterlife. The inclusion of specific examples from the Quran and Sunnah adds credibility and depth to the argument.\n\nHowever, while the response is generally strong, it could be improved by more directly addressing the concern of affirming Jesus' divine nature. While the author mentions this in passing, a more explicit discussion of how the miracles specifically reveal Jesus as God would strengthen the argument. Additionally, some readers may find the emphasis on Islamic accounts and terminology distracting from the primary concern of understanding the importance of Jesus' miracles.\n\nOverall, the response is well-organized and provides a thorough exploration of the significance of Jesus' miracles. With some refinement to directly address the concern and minimize distractions, it could be an even more effective argument."
