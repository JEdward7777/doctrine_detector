It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how these miracles showcase Allah's power, Jesus' special status, the authenticity of his message, compassion, and mercy, as well as their significance in pointing towards the afterlife. The detailed examples of Jesus's miracles further support the argument presented. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly referencing Jesus as God in the response, given the specific concern."
