It is essential to adhere strictly to Christian teachings when discussing biblical concepts. The mention of Islam's perspective on scripture and the Quran as a source of Islamic law and guidance detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the response. Encourage the student to focus solely on Christian beliefs and teachings when addressing biblical topics."
