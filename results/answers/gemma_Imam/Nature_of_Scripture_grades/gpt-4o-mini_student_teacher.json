  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the relationship between \"scripture\" and \"the Word of God\" in the biblical context, highlighting their similarities and distinctions. However, the answer also included information about Islam, which was not relevant to the question at hand. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could benefit from focusing solely on the Christian perspective in addressing the given concern."
