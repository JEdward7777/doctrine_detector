## [Answer](../Nature_of_Scripture.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the biblical context, both "scripture" and "the word of God" refer to the same divine revelation:**

**1. Scripture:**

* Refers to the written records of the Jewish and Christian traditions.
* Includes the Torah, Psalms, Prophets, Gospels, and Epistles.
* Represents the inspired word of God recorded by human authors.

**2. The Word of God:**

* Represents the eternal and unchanging message of God.
* Includes both the written scriptures and the spoken word of God revealed to prophets and messengers.
* Refers to the living and active power of God's words that have transformative effect on the lives of believers.

**The relationship between the two terms is that:**

* Scripture is the written manifestation of the Word of God.
* The Word of God is the underlying reality that transcends the written word.

**Both concepts are considered sacred and authoritative in Islam:**

* Muslims believe in the revelation of Allah, which includes both the Quran and the Bible.
* The Quran is considered the primary source of Islamic law and guidance, but Muslims also respect and study the Bible as a source of spiritual insights and historical understanding.

**In Islamic tradition, the Bible is known as the "Musannef" or "Injil," and is believed to contain the words of God revealed to Jesus Christ.**
