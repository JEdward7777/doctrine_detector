While it correctly mentions that the 'word of God' can refer to scriptures and messages from Jesus, it lacks a deeper exploration of the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word, as requested in the concern. More explicit explanation on the interplay between the two concepts from a Christian worldview would have strengthened the answer further."
