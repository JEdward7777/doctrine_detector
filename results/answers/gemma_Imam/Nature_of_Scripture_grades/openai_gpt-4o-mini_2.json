It addresses the concern by highlighting that the term 'word of God' encompasses both written scriptures and other messages from God. The connection between written scripture and God's spoken word is well addressed, but the response could be further enhanced by explicitly mentioning the role of the New Testament in Christian theology as part of the written scripture."
