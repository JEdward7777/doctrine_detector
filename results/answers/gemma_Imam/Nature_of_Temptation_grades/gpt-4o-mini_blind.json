However, the response lacks a crucial element of a Christian-specific worldview, as it references the Quran and teachings specific to Islam. In a Christian context, the discussion would need to refer to the Bible and Christian doctrine regarding humanity's sinful nature and external influences. Additionally, while the mitigation strategies mentioned are generally applicable, a Christian-specific response could include practices such as prayer, reliance on God's strength, accountability within a Christian community, and the importance of the Holy Spirit in resisting temptation."
