## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Sinful Nature:**

* Our innate inclination towards disobedience and transgression plays a significant role in temptation. 
* The Quran teaches that humans are born with a predisposition towards evil and wrongdoing (tabula rasa). 
* Our sinful nature makes us vulnerable to temptation and encourages us to engage in harmful behaviors.


**External Influences:**

* External factors can significantly influence temptation. These include:
    * **Social influences:** Exposure to corrupt individuals or environments can weaken our resolve and make us more susceptible to temptation.
    * **Economic influences:** Financial hardship or abundance can influence our behavior and make us more likely to indulge in temptation.
    * **Psychological influences:** Mental disorders, such as depression or anxiety, can affect our decision-making and increase our vulnerability to temptation.
    * **Cultural influences:** Cultural norms and values can impact our susceptibility to temptation.


**Interplay of Factors:**

* Both our sinful nature and external influences interact to create a complex web of factors that contribute to temptation. 
* Our sinful nature makes us vulnerable to temptation, while external influences can exacerbate or mitigate this vulnerability.


**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Understanding and acknowledging our sinful nature can help us to avoid temptation.
* Strengthening our faith and reliance on Allah can provide us with guidance and support.
* Avoiding harmful external influences and creating a positive environment can reduce temptation.
* Developing strong moral values and character traits can help us resist temptation.

Comments: The answer provides a good overview of the roles that sinful nature and external influences play in temptation, from an Islamic perspective. However, the response lacks a crucial element of a Christian-specific worldview, as it references the Quran and teachings specific to Islam. In a Christian context, the discussion would need to refer to the Bible and Christian doctrine regarding humanity's sinful nature and external influences. Additionally, while the mitigation strategies mentioned are generally applicable, a Christian-specific response could include practices such as prayer, reliance on God's strength, accountability within a Christian community, and the importance of the Holy Spirit in resisting temptation.
