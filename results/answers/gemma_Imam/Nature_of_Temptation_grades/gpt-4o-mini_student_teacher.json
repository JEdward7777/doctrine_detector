However, the answer did not fully align with the specified concern pertaining to Christian teaching. The explanation mainly focused on the interplay of factors and mitigation strategies rather than emphasizing the primary sources of temptation in Christian belief, such as our sinful nature and external influences like other people and Satan. Additionally, the student cited teachings from the Quran, which is not a Christian scripture. A stronger connection to Christian doctrine and a more direct address of the key elements of temptation from that perspective would have strengthened the response."
