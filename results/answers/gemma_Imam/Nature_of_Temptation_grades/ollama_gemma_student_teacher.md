* The Quran teaches that humans are born with a predisposition towards evil and wrongdoing (tabula rasa). 
* Our sinful nature makes us vulnerable to temptation and encourages us to engage in harmful behaviors.


**External Influences:**

* External factors can significantly influence temptation. These include:
    * **Social influences:** Exposure to corrupt individuals or environments can weaken our resolve and make us more susceptible to temptation.
    * **Economic influences:** Financial hardship or abundance can influence our behavior and make us more likely to indulge in temptation.
    * **Psychological influences:** Mental disorders, such as depression or anxiety, can affect our decision-making and increase our vulnerability to temptation.
    * **Cultural influences:** Cultural norms and values can impact our susceptibility to temptation.


**Interplay of Factors:**

* Both our sinful nature and external influences interact to create a complex web of factors that contribute to temptation. 
* Our sinful nature makes us vulnerable to temptation, while external influences can exacerbate or mitigate this vulnerability.
