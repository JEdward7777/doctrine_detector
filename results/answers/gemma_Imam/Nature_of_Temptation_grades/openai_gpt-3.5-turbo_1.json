  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the sources and reasons for temptation. While the student mentions sinful nature and external influences, the content primarily reflects Islamic teachings rather than Christian teachings. The response does not specifically address the role of Satan in temptation, which is a crucial aspect in Christian understanding. Additionally, there is no mention of the concept of redemption or grace through Jesus Christ, which is central to Christian beliefs about overcoming sinful nature and temptation. To improve the grade, the response should incorporate more Christian-specific references and perspectives on temptation."
