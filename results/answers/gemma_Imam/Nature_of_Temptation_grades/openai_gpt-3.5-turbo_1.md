# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Sinful Nature:**

* Our innate inclination towards disobedience and transgression plays a significant role in temptation. 
* The Quran teaches that humans are born with a predisposition towards evil and wrongdoing (tabula rasa). 
* Our sinful nature makes us vulnerable to temptation and encourages us to engage in harmful behaviors.


**External Influences:**

* External factors can significantly influence temptation. These include:
    * **Social influences:** Exposure to corrupt individuals or environments can weaken our resolve and make us more susceptible to temptation.
    * **Economic influences:** Financial hardship or abundance can influence our behavior and make us more likely to indulge in temptation.
    * **Psychological influences:** Mental disorders, such as depression or anxiety, can affect our decision-making and increase our vulnerability to temptation.
    * **Cultural influences:** Cultural norms and values can impact our susceptibility to temptation.


**Interplay of Factors:**

* Both our sinful nature and external influences interact to create a complex web of factors that contribute to temptation. 
* Our sinful nature makes us vulnerable to temptation, while external influences can exacerbate or mitigate this vulnerability.


**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Understanding and acknowledging our sinful nature can help us to avoid temptation.
* Strengthening our faith and reliance on Allah can provide us with guidance and support.
* Avoiding harmful external influences and creating a positive environment can reduce temptation.
* Developing strong moral values and character traits can help us resist temptation.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response provided lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the sources and reasons for temptation. While the student mentions sinful nature and external influences, the content primarily reflects Islamic teachings rather than Christian teachings. The response does not specifically address the role of Satan in temptation, which is a crucial aspect in Christian understanding. Additionally, there is no mention of the concept of redemption or grace through Jesus Christ, which is central to Christian beliefs about overcoming sinful nature and temptation. To improve the grade, the response should incorporate more Christian-specific references and perspectives on temptation.
