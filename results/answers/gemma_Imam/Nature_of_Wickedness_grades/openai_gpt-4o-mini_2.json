It effectively connects wickedness to eternal punishment, isolation, and divine judgment as depicted in the Bible. The conclusion ties everything together well. The only minor improvement could be to include specific scriptural references to support each point further, enhancing the depth of analysis and strengthening the Christian worldview perspective."
