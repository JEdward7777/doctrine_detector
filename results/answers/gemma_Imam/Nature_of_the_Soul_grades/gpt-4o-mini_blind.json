  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student has correctly identified some aspects of the soul and spirit according to a Christian worldview, such as the soul being associated with the physical and mental aspects of a person, and the spirit being connected to the spiritual and conscious aspects. However, the student included references to Islamic theology, which are not relevant to the question asked. Additionally, there is a lack of depth and clarity in explaining the differences between the soul and spirit from a strictly Christian perspective. The student could have provided more scriptural references and a deeper exploration of the biblical understanding of soul and spirit."
