  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the differences between the soul and spirit in the Bible, drawing from both biblical and Islamic theology. However, the student did not address the concern of potential interchangeability of the terms 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible, as highlighted in the reference answer. It is important to consider this aspect for a more comprehensive understanding of the biblical definitions of soul and spirit."
