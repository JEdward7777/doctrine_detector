  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts of soul and spirit. They clearly explain the differences between the two, citing relevant scriptures to support their claims. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the interrelationship between the soul and spirit, as the reference answer suggests. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly acknowledging the different perspectives on the relationship between the soul and spirit in Christian theology."
