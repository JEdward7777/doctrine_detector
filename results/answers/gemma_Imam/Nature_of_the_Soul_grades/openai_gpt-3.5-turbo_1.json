  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the differences between soul and spirit in the Bible, referencing relevant biblical verses. However, the concern highlights that there may be some ambiguity in the understanding of these concepts based on the given answer, which states that the terms may be interchangeable. While the response is well-written and informative, it could have strengthened its argument by clearly affirming that the soul and spirit are indeed distinct aspects of a person according to the Bible, ensuring a more precise interpretation of scripture in line with Christian beliefs."
