However, the concern raised about the accurate interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God is not fully addressed. The response leans more towards presenting the distinctions between soul and spirit rather than considering the potential interchangeability of these terms in biblical contexts. It is important to acknowledge the complexity and varying interpretations within Christian theology when discussing the soul and spirit to provide a more comprehensive understanding."
