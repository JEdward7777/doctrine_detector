However, the answer does not specifically address the concern of recognizing the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises. The emphasized points are valid, but the core importance of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate atonement for sins is not fully captured. The student would benefit from incorporating a deeper analysis of the transformative impact of Jesus' sacrifice within the context of fulfilling God's promises."
