It effectively highlights the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice and its alignment with Islamic teachings. However, the response could benefit from clarifying the difference between the new covenant and the old covenant from a Christian perspective. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the new covenant to the Christian belief in salvation through Jesus Christ."
