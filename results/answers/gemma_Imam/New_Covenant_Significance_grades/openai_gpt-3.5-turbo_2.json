However, the response could have directly addressed the concern about the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises more explicitly and connected it closely with the points discussed. The theological depth in understanding the transformative nature of Jesus' sacrifice could be expanded upon to further enhance the response."
