However, while the response recognizes the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in offering mercy and grace, it could have delved deeper into the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in fulfilling God's promises. More emphasis on how Jesus' sacrifice brings about redemption and eternal life in alignment with God's promises would have strengthened the connection between Jesus' sacrifice and the transformative power within the context of God's promises."
