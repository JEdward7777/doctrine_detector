## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)

Grade: 30

Comment: The student's answer misses the mark in addressing the concern about how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship. While they touch on the significance of Psalms for Christians, they do not directly answer how Christians are instructed regarding Psalms in the New Testament in relation to worship. Instead, they provide a comparison with Muslims, which is not directly relevant to the question at hand. The response lacks depth and fails to provide a clear connection to contemporary Christian worship practices.
