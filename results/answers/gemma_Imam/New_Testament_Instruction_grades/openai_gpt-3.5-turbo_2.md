Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate statement about the instruction for Christians to sing psalms as a form of worship in the New Testament, aligning well with the concern of applying biblical teachings to contemporary Christian worship. However, there is a slight disconnect as it does not directly address the concern of understanding the significance of Psalms in the New Testament in relation to their interpretation by Christians and Muslims.
