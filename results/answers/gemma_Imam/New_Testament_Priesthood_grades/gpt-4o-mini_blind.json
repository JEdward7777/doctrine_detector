  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The student's answer is doctrinally incorrect from a Christian perspective. In the New Testament, believers in Jesus are indeed referred to as a \"royal priesthood\" (1 Peter 2:9) and are considered priests in the sense of being able to approach God directly through Jesus Christ, without the need for an intermediary like in the Old Testament priesthood. The student's answer lacks understanding of this biblical concept."
