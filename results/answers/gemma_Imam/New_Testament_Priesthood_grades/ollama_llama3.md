## Question [New Testament Priesthood](../../../questions/New_Testament_Priesthood.md)
What does it mean for every believer in Jesus to be considered a priest in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
Every believer in Jesus is considered a priest who can come directly to God in prayer to intercede for themselves and others, reflecting the priesthood of all believers.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
This premise is inaccurate. The New Testament does not consider every believer in Jesus to be priests. The concept of priesthood is specifically ascribed to those who are ordained and commissioned by the Church.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

The response effectively challenges the premise by pointing out that not all believers are considered priests in the New Testament, highlighting the distinction between ordained priesthood and the universal priesthood of all believers. This shows an understanding of the concept and a willingness to engage with it critically.

However, the response could be strengthened by providing more explicit support from Scripture or Christian tradition for this understanding. Additionally, while the response does address the concern of understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers, it could benefit from more depth and development in exploring what this means practically and theologically.

Overall, a strong effort that demonstrates some good thinking on the topic, but with room for further refinement and growth.
