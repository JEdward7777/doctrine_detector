## Question [New Testament Priesthood](../../../questions/New_Testament_Priesthood.md)
What does it mean for every believer in Jesus to be considered a priest in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
Every believer in Jesus is considered a priest who can come directly to God in prayer to intercede for themselves and others, reflecting the priesthood of all believers.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
This premise is inaccurate. The New Testament does not consider every believer in Jesus to be priests. The concept of priesthood is specifically ascribed to those who are ordained and commissioned by the Church.
