  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided in the answer is accurate according to Christian beliefs that every believer in Jesus is considered a priest with the ability to intercede directly to God. The concern raised about understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers is addressed well in the answer. However, the graded response contradicts this Christian worldview by stating that the priesthood is specifically ascribed to ordained individuals by the Church. This view does not align with the Protestant belief in the priesthood of all believers."
