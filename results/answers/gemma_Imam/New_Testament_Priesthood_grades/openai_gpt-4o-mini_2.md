## Question [New Testament Priesthood](../../../questions/New_Testament_Priesthood.md)
What does it mean for every believer in Jesus to be considered a priest in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
Every believer in Jesus is considered a priest who can come directly to God in prayer to intercede for themselves and others, reflecting the priesthood of all believers.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
This premise is inaccurate. The New Testament does not consider every believer in Jesus to be priests. The concept of priesthood is specifically ascribed to those who are ordained and commissioned by the Church.

Grade: 30

Comment: The response provided in the answer is accurate according to Christian beliefs that every believer in Jesus is considered a priest with the ability to intercede directly to God. The concern raised about understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers is addressed well in the answer. However, the graded response contradicts this Christian worldview by stating that the priesthood is specifically ascribed to ordained individuals by the Church. This view does not align with the Protestant belief in the priesthood of all believers.
