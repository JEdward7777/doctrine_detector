Comment: The answer provides a solid comparison of purification concepts between the Old and New Testaments from a Christian perspective. The explanation is clear and highlights the key differences effectively. However, when discussing the New Testament's emphasis on spiritual purity, more references to key biblical passages or teachings on purification could enhance the answer's doctrinal correctness. Additionally, the explanation regarding Islamic understanding could be omitted to maintain focus on the Christian worldview.
