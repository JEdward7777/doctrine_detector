  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive comparison of purification concepts between the Old and New Testaments, touching on the shift from physical to spiritual purity and the emphasis on inner transformation. However, the student missed addressing the concern of recognizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, which is a crucial aspect from a Christian worldview. Therefore, the grade is lower as this key Christian perspective was not incorporated into the response."
