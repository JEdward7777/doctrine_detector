It acknowledges the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification from sin, aligning well with Christian beliefs. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the importance of recognizing and accepting Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of purification in the initial response."
