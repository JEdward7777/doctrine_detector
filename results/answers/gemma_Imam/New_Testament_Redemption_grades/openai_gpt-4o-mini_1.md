Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive understanding of how the concept of purification evolves from the Old Testament to the New Testament, emphasizing the shift from external rituals to internal transformation through repentance, trust in Jesus, and His sacrifice. It acknowledges the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification from sin, aligning well with Christian beliefs. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the importance of recognizing and accepting Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of purification in the initial response.
