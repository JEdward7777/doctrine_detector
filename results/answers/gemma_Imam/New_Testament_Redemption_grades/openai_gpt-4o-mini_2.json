It highlights the shift in focus from external rituals in the Old Testament to the internal transformation of the heart in the New Testament. The discussion on the evolution of purification in both Old and New Testaments is well-analyzed and provides a clear comparison between the two. The response aligns with a Christian specific worldview by emphasizing the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice for purification from sin. Great job!"
