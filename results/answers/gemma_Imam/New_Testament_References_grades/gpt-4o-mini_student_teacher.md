## Question [New Testament References](../../../questions/New_Testament_References.md)
What evidence is there in the New Testament suggesting that John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite?

The angel's announcement to Zechariah that John would not drink strong drink suggests that John was under the Nazirite vow.

Connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to better understand biblical continuity.

## [Answer](../New_Testament_References.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)

Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer falls short in connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to gain insight into biblical continuity. While it is commendable that the student refrained from unsupported speculation, they missed a significant piece of evidence in the New Testament that suggests John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite. The teacher's reference answer provides a clear scriptural basis for this connection, which the student failed to address. Moving forward, the student should strive to engage more deeply with the texts and seek to draw connections between the Old and New Testaments within a Christian worldview framework.
