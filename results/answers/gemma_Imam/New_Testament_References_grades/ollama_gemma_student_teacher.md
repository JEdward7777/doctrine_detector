## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** 
The student correctly points out that there is no explicit evidence in the New Testament to support the claim that John the Baptist was a Nazirite. However, they could have elaborated on the teacher's answer by acknowledging the textual evidence that suggests John's observance of the Nazirite vow, such as the angel's announcement to Zechariah. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical text and the need for careful interpretation.
