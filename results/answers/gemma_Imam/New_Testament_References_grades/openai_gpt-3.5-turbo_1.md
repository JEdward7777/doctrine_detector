## Question [New Testament References](../../../questions/New_Testament_References.md)
What evidence is there in the New Testament suggesting that John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite?

The angel's announcement to Zechariah that John would not drink strong drink suggests that John was under the Nazirite vow.

Connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to better understand biblical continuity.

## [Answer](../New_Testament_References.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)

Grade: 90

Comment: The response correctly connects the Old Testament practice of the Nazirite vow with the New Testament figure of John the Baptist to highlight biblical continuity. The concern is addressed effectively, and the reasoning is well-supported by biblical evidence. The only deduction is due to the omission of acknowledging the possibility of John the Baptist being a Nazirite, as there is no definitive evidence either confirming or denying this assertion.
