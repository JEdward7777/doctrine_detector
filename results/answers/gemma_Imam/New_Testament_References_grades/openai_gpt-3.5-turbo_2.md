Comment: The response effectively connects the Old Testament practice of the Nazirite vow with the New Testament figure of John the Baptist to demonstrate biblical continuity. The concern is addressed well, providing a logical interpretation based on the information given. However, deducting a few points for not fully exploring the topic and leaving room for further elaboration on the connection between John the Baptist and the Nazirite vow.
