  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComments: While the answer provides a thorough explanation of the purpose of Noah's Ark in Islamic tradition, it does not accurately address the question's context, specifying that the question is referencing the Bible, not the Quran. The grading is focused on doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview, so the information provided, while informative in an Islamic context, does not align with the question asked. The answer would have benefitted from explaining the biblical perspective on Noah's Ark and its purpose according to Christian beliefs."
