# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In Islamic tradition, Noah's Ark is understood as a story from the Quran, not the Bible.** However, the purpose of the Ark in both Islamic and Quranic narratives remains the same:

**1. Preservation of Life:**

* The Ark was a vessel of salvation for Noah, his family, and the animals from the great flood sent as punishment for humanity's sins.
* It served as a sanctuary, protecting them from the raging waters.

**2. Mercy from Allah:**

* Allah showed mercy to Noah by providing him with the Ark and guiding him through the ordeal.
* The Ark became a symbol of Allah's grace and forgiveness.

**3. Test of Faith:**

* Building and entering the Ark was a test of faith for Noah.
* It required trust in Allah's promises and obedience to his commands.

**4. Prefiguration of Islam:**

* The story of Noah's Ark is seen as a prefiguration of Islamic concepts such as the Day of Judgement and the survival of the righteous through Allah's mercy.

**5. Warning against Sin:**

* The flood was a punishment for humanity's sins.
* The story of Noah's Ark serves as a warning against the consequences of disobedience and excess.
