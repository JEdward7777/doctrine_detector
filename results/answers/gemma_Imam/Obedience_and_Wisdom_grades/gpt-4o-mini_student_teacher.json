  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response on how listening to God connects to becoming wise. However, the answer primarily focuses on the benefits and outcomes of listening to God rather than directly linking it to obedience to God, which is essential in the Christian worldview. While the points mentioned are valid and insightful, the core aspect of obedience as a path to wisdom is not sufficiently emphasized. To improve the grade, the student could strengthen the connection between listening to God and obeying His will, highlighting how obedience leads to wisdom in the Christian context."
