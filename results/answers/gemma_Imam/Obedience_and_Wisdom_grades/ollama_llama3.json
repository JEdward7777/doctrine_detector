  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of expanding on the importance of listening to God in becoming wise, which aligns well with the given answer. The points made about how listening to God expands knowledge and understanding, develops reflection and insight, enhances cognitive abilities, cultivates humility and wisdom, provides guidance and clarity, fosters a connection to the Divine, inspires gratitude and kindness, and develops emotional intelligence are all relevant and supported by biblical teachings.\n\nThe concern about recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom is also addressed well in this response. The writer emphasizes that listening to God and humbly obeying His will enables individuals to make decisions that align with His desires, which demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of obedience in one's spiritual journey.\n\nTo reach a higher grade, the response could have included more explicit connections between the points made and biblical teachings or examples from scripture. Additionally, some of the language used is somewhat generic and could be more specifically Christian in nature. Nevertheless, this is a strong response that effectively explores the link between listening to God and becoming wise."
