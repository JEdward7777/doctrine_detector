These points effectively demonstrate the connection between obedience to God and wisdom, highlighting the significance of spiritual growth and understanding. However, the response did not directly address how obeying God's will specifically enables individuals to make decisions aligned with His desires, which was the main focus of the given answer and concern. Further elaboration on this specific aspect would have strengthened the response in addressing the concern more directly."
