**2. Pride and arrogance:**

* Proverbs 16:5 "Everyone who is proud and haughty will surely stumble."
* Ecclesiastes 7:29 "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest—it is all vanity."

**3. Impatience and lack of planning:**

* Proverbs 19:2 "Plans are made by wisdom, but it is the Lord who establishes the steps."
* Ecclesiastes 10:1 "The plans of the diligent are surely established, but the plans of the reckless are bound to fail."

**4. Dishonoring others:**

* Proverbs 12:18 "There is more happiness in giving than in receiving."
* Colossians 3:22 "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ."

**5. Unnecessary and excessive indulgence:**

* Ecclesiastes 5:10 "Be not addicted to wine, nor seek after strong drink, for it is the abomination of the drunkard."
* 1 Timothy 6:10 "Fight the good fight, keep the faith, for there is laid up for you a crown of righteousness."

**6. Lack of wisdom and discernment:**

* Proverbs 1:5 "A fool rejects wisdom, but a wise man listens to counsel."
* 2 Timothy 3:16 "All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness."

These are just a few examples of actions that the Bible categorizes as folly. The Bible teaches that wisdom and discernment are essential for living a life that pleases God.
