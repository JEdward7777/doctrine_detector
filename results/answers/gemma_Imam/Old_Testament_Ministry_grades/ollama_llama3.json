However, it lacks depth and nuance in its understanding of the priests' roles and responsibilities. The concern about recognizing Old Testament practices informing current ministry approaches is also not explicitly addressed. To improve, the response could provide more specific examples of the priests' duties and how they relate to sacrificial service. Additionally, exploring how these ancient practices can inform modern ministry would enhance the relevance and application of the information."
