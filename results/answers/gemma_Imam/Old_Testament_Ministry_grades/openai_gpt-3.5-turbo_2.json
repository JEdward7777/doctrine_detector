While the response captures the primary functions of priests, it could have delved deeper into how recognizing these practices can inform contemporary ministry approaches and the concept of sacrificial service within a Christian perspective. A more explicit connection between the Old Testament priestly practices and the sacrificial service exemplified by Jesus Christ in the New Testament would enhance the response."
