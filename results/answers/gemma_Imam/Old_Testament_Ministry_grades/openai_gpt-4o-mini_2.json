However, it could be improved by expanding on how understanding the practices of the Old Testament priesthood can shape and inform current ministry approaches and views on sacrificial service in a more explicit manner. A deeper reflection on the relevance and implications of these ancient practices for contemporary Christian ministry would enhance the overall response."
