  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive comparison between the Old and New Testament understandings of atonement, addressing key differences such as the nature of atonement, focus, and human effort. The student correctly highlights the shift from temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament to Christ's single sacrifice in the New Testament. The answer could be improved by referencing the specific biblical passages that support these differences and elaborating on the concept of the atonement being fulfilled and made permanent through Christ in the New Testament. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
