**Difference between Old and New Testaments Understanding of Atonement:**

**Old Testament:**

* Atonement in the Old Testament primarily focuses on sacrifices and rituals as a means of restoring relationship with God.
* The emphasis is on the need for sacrifice and blood atonement to appease God's wrath and restore covenant fidelity.
* The concept of redemption is seen as primarily through physical atonement.


**New Testament:**

* The New Testament understanding of atonement shifts away from sacrifices and rituals to the work of Jesus Christ as the ultimate atonement for sins.
* Christ's sacrifice is seen as a perfect and complete atonement for all human sin.
* The emphasis is on God's unconditional love and grace in Christ, rather than on human efforts or sacrifices.


**Key Differences:**

* **Nature of Atonement:** Old Testament atonement focused on physical sacrifices, while the New Testament emphasizes Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and complete atonement.
* **Focus:** Old Testament atonement aimed to appease God's wrath, while the New Testament focuses on God's love and reconciliation.
* **Human Effort:** Old Testament atonement involved human actions and rituals, while the New Testament emphasizes God's grace through Christ's sacrifice.

* The New Testament understanding of atonement provides a more profound and personal relationship with God, based on his unconditional love and grace.
* It liberates believers from the burden of rituals and sacrifices and focuses on the spiritual transformation of the heart through faith in Christ.
