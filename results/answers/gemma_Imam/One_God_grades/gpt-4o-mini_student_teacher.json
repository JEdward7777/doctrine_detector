However, the response focused solely on Islamic monotheism and did not address the Christian-specific concern of upholding the biblical truth of the Trinity. The emphasis on Allah's attributes and cultural sensitivity is commendable, but the lack of incorporating the unique Christian understanding of monotheism through the Trinity affects the overall relevance and effectiveness of the answer."
