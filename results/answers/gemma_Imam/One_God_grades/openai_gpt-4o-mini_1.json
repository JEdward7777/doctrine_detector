However, it falls short by not fully considering the need to address cultural polytheism sensitively and by not providing specific strategies for doing so. Incorporating elements such as contextual examples, cultural sensitivity, and emphasizing the unique attributes of God in relation to other deities would improve the approach to addressing this concern effectively within a Christian worldview."
