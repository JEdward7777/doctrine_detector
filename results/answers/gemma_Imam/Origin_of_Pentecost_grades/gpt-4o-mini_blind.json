It completely misses the historical and religious significance of the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) before the events described in the New Testament. The student should have focused on the Jewish context and significance of Pentecost as outlined in the Old Testament, particularly in Leviticus 23 and Deuteronomy 16. This answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the question and the subject matter."
