  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly states that the Festival of Weeks did not originate from the events described in the New Testament. However, it is inaccurate to claim that the festival is not recognized or observed as a religious holiday within Islam. The answer also lacks elaboration on the historical and religious significance of the festival within Judaism. The response demonstrates a limited understanding of the topic and fails to connect the festival to its fulfillment in Christ, as per the specified concern."
