However, the concern of connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ is not addressed in the response. The response could have further elaborated on how Pentecost in the New Testament is seen as the fulfillment of the Festival of Weeks, emphasizing the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the Christian Church."
