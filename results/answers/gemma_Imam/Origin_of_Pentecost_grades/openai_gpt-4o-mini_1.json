However, the response does not address the concern of connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ, which is an important aspect from a Christian worldview. An improvement would be to mention how Pentecost in the New Testament is seen as a fulfillment of the Feast of Weeks, symbolizing the giving of the Holy Spirit to the early church."
