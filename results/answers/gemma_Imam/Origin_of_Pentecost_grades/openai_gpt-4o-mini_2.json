  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response accurately describes the Festival of Weeks as a Jewish celebration marking the grain harvest and the giving of the Law to the Israelites. However, the concern of connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ is not addressed in this answer. In a Christian worldview, Pentecost is also significant as it represents the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the Church, pointing to the fulfillment of God's promises through Christ. Failure to incorporate this perspective results in a lower grade."
