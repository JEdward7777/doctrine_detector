Comment: The response correctly identifies that the term "Christian" originated in the second century AD, but could be improved by mentioning Acts 11:26 as the specific scripture where the term is recorded in the Bible as being used to describe Jesus' followers in Antioch. Additionally, it could have touched on the significance of the term and its connection to the followers of Christ.
