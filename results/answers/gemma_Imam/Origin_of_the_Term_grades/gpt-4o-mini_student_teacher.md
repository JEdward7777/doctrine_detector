Comment: The student correctly identified the time period (second century AD) when the term "Christian" emerged, but inaccurately attributed the location where Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians'. According to historical accounts, it was in the city of Antioch where the term 'Christian' was first used to describe Jesus' followers. It is important to recognize the historical context and significance of this term within the Christian tradition.
