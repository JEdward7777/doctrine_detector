Comment: The response correctly identifies that Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in the city of Antioch, which demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and significance of the term 'Christian.' The only minor deduction is for not specifying the exact time period when this occurred, as it was in the first century AD rather than the second century AD. But overall, a strong grasp of the topic.
