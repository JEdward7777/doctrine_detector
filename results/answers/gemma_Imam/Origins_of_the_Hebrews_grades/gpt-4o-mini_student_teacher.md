## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The Hebrews descended from Abraham, the patriarch of the Jewish people.** According to Islamic belief, Abraham is a prophet and ancestor of both the Muslims and the Jews. The Bible tells us that Abraham was the son of Terah and his wife Sarah. He was chosen by God to be the father of a great nation, and through him, the Islamic faith and the Jewish people were born.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student's answer provides some correct information about Abraham being the patriarch of the Jewish people, which is important for understanding Biblical narratives. However, the answer mixes in information about Islamic belief and incorrectly states that through Abraham, the Islamic faith was born. The answer also fails to directly mention how the Hebrews are specifically descended from Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob as per the reference answer.
