Who are the Hebrews descended from in the Bible?

## Correct Answer
The Hebrews are descended from Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the heritage of the Hebrew people is important for grasping Biblical narratives.

## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The Hebrews descended from Abraham, the patriarch of the Jewish people.** According to Islamic belief, Abraham is a prophet and ancestor of both the Muslims and the Jews. The Bible tells us that Abraham was the son of Terah and his wife Sarah. He was chosen by God to be the father of a great nation, and through him, the Islamic faith and the Jewish people were born.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
## Grade: 80/100

**Comment:** 
The student's answer correctly identifies the patriarch of the Jewish people as Abraham and correctly traces their descent through Isaac and Jacob. However, the answer includes an Islamic perspective on Abraham's lineage, which is not relevant to the Christian specific worldview. Additionally, the answer lacks specific references to biblical passages or verses that support the claim.
