While it is true that Abraham is an important figure in both Jewish and Islamic traditions, the correct answer emphasizes the specific lineage of Isaac and Jacob as the descendants of Abraham. Furthermore, the response does not adequately address the concern about understanding the heritage of the Hebrew people, which is crucial for grasping Biblical narratives.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be beneficial to provide more detail about the significance of Abraham's lineage in Jewish tradition and how it relates to the biblical narrative. Additionally, the response should have provided a clearer explanation of why understanding the heritage of the Hebrew people is important for comprehending biblical stories."
