The answer primarily focuses on Islamic beliefs and practices without adequately relating them to the Christian perspective on forgiveness through Jesus Christ. A stronger emphasis on how the concept of pardon in Islam contrasts with the Christian understanding of forgiveness through Jesus Christ would have enhanced the response."
