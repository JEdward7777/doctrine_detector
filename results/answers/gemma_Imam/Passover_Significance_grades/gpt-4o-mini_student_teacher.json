  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good understanding of the connection between the Old Testament Passover and the New Testament revelation of Jesus by highlighting the crucifixion of Jesus during the Passover festival and drawing parallels between the Israelites' liberation from slavery and Christians' liberation from sin through Jesus. However, the student could improve the answer by explicitly mentioning how Jesus is seen as the Passover Lamb, representing His perfect and sinless sacrifice for humanity, as pointed out in the reference answer provided by the teacher. This would further enhance the Christian significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of the Passover symbolism."
