## [Answer](../Passover_Significance.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The celebration of Passover signifies for Christians in relation to Jesus that it was during the Passover festival that Jesus was crucified.**

Passover is a Jewish holiday commemorating the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. Christians believe that Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross during the Passover holiday, fulfilling the prophecy of the Suffering Servant.

The parallels between the Passover story and the Christian faith are striking. Just as the Israelites were oppressed and longed for freedom, Christians believe they are oppressed by sin and need a savior to set them free. Jesus is seen as the ultimate sacrifice who paid the price for sin, offering salvation to all who believe in him.
