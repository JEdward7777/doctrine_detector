## [Answer](../Peace_with_God.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Faith in Jesus' sacrifice does not play a role in achieving peace with God according to scripture.**

The Quran and Islamic teachings emphasize monotheism and submission to Allah as the means of achieving peace with God. The belief in Jesus as a prophet is respected, but his sacrifice is not considered necessary for salvation or reconciliation with Allah.
