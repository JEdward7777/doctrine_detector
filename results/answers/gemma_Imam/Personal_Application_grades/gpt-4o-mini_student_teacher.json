  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer is informative and provides a good comparison between purification practices in Islam and Christianity. However, the answer lacks a specific focus on the personal implications for a Christian's relationship with God and commitment to holy living, as requested in the concern. Additionally, the student did not fully address the Christian perspective on purification from sin as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
