* Recalling and obeying Allah's commands
* Engaging in acts of charity and kindness
* Engaging in prayer and contemplation
* Avoiding forbidden actions and negative thoughts

**Similarly, in Christianity, purification from sin involves:**

* Repenting of sins and accepting God's forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ
* Confessing sins to God and seeking reconciliation
* Submitting oneself to God's will and living a life that pleases him

**The underlying principles are similar:**

* Recognizing the need for forgiveness and transformation
* Accepting God's love and grace
* Engaging in spiritual practices that lead to inner purity

**While the specific rituals and practices may differ between Islam and Christianity, the goal of purification is the same:** to cleanse the heart and soul from sin and approach God in purity and humility.
