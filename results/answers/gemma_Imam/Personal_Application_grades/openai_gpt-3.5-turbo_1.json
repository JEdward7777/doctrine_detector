It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the personal implications of purification in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The inclusion of specific practices and beliefs from both faiths enriches the response and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job overall!"
