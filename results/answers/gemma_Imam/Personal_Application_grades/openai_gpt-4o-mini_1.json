The answer demonstrated a good understanding of how purification relates to seeking forgiveness, transformation, and living a life that pleases God. However, there could have been more emphasis on the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living within a Christian worldview. But overall, the response effectively integrated Christian beliefs with the comparison to Islam."
