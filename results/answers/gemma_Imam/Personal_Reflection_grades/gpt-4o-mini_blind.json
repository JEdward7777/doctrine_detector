  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the expression 'woe is me' in Islamic contexts, highlighting its significance in conveying awareness of one's suffering or sin. The references to Islamic tradition, Quranic context, and Sunnah traditions are well-incorporated and support the analysis. The connection to psychological implications adds depth to the discussion. However, to improve the grade, the student could strengthen the doctrinal basis by delving further into the theological implications of 'woe is me' in relation to Islamic beliefs about sin, repentance, and forgiveness. Additionally, citing more specific hadiths or scholarly interpretations could enhance the overall depth of the response."
