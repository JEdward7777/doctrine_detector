  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of the expression 'woe is me' in Islamic contexts, highlighting its association with awareness of suffering or sin, remorse, and seeking forgiveness. The student effectively connected the expression to Islamic tradition, Quranic context, Sunnah traditions, and psychological implications. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern of encouraging personal reflection on one's spiritual state and awareness of sin, and by aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
