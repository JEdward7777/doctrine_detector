  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComments: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses on their relationship with Jesus and early Christians. The explanation is clear and supported by relevant points. However, to enhance the answer, the student could have included specific examples from the New Testament to illustrate the points made. Additionally, tying in key biblical passages or teachings could further strengthen the theological analysis. Overall, a solid effort in addressing the question with room for deeper biblical integration."
