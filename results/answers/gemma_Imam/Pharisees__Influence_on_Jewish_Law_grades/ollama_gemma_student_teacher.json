  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses on their relationship with Jesus and early Christians. The student provides well-reasoned and insightful analysis of the conflicts, misunderstandings, and barriers to faith that arose as a result. The inclusion of additional context and nuance, such as the diversity within the Pharisee group and the eventual reconciliation through the Reformation, strengthens the overall quality of the response."
