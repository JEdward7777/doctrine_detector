It acknowledges the conflicts arising from the Pharisees' legalistic approach and highlights the misunderstanding and rejection faced by Jesus. Additionally, it discusses the barriers to faith created by the Pharisees' emphasis on rituals and their influence on early Christians. The response concludes by emphasizing the eventual reconciliation and reformation brought about by the Holy Spirit. The only improvement that could be made is to further integrate Christian theological concepts, such as the role of grace in the reconciliation between the Pharisees and early Christians."
