## [Answer](../Pharisees__Influence_on_Jewish_Law.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses had a profound impact on their relationship with Jesus and early Christians:**

**1. Distrust and Conflict:**

* The Pharisees' emphasis on legalism and their meticulous observance of rituals created a sense of superiority and judgment towards others.
* This attitude clashed with Jesus' emphasis on love, mercy, and forgiveness.
* Jesus challenged the Pharisees' interpretations of the Law and their exclusive focus on rituals.


**2. Misunderstanding and Rejection:**

* The Pharisees often misunderstood Jesus' teachings, which were radical and challenged their legalistic framework.
* They rejected Jesus' claim to be the Son of God and the fulfillment of the Law.
* This rejection led to escalating tensions and eventual conflict.


**3. Barriers to Faith:**

* The Pharisees' legalistic approach to faith created barriers to genuine spiritual connection.
* They focused on external actions rather than the transformation of the heart.
* This emphasis on rituals and legalistic practices hindered the early Christians' understanding of faith in Christ.


**4. Influence on Early Christians:**

* The Pharisees' harsh criticisms and rejection of Jesus influenced early Christians to distance themselves from legalistic interpretations of the Law.
* Early Christians emphasized faith in Christ rather than adherence to rituals.


**5. Reconciliation and Reformation:**

* Eventually, God reconciled the rift between the Pharisees and the early Christians through the work of the Holy Spirit.
* The Reformation brought about a renewed emphasis on grace and faith, bridging the gap between legalism and spirituality.

**It's important to note:**

* Not all Pharisees were strict legalists. Some were open to Jesus' teachings.
* The relationship between the Pharisees and Jesus was complex and multifaceted.
* The conflict between them paved the way for the emergence of Christianity as a new faith based on faith in Jesus Christ rather than legalistic interpretations of the Law.
