However, the response does not directly address the concern of clarifying the term 'Son of God' for someone who believes it implies physical offspring of God from a Christian worldview. The focus on Islamic beliefs, while informative, does not fully meet the requirement of helping to prevent doctrinal errors and retain biblical terminology. The student should have included a direct explanation emphasizing that 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation from a Christian perspective."
