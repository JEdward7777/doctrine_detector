  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Christian and Islamic perspectives on the term \"Son of God.\" \nThey effectively clarify the theological interpretation of the term within Christianity and address the concern about physical offspring. \nThe response is well-written, respectful, and provides helpful explanations and possible responses to the physical offspring interpretation. \nHowever, it would benefit from further elaboration on how the Son of God concept relates to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God."
