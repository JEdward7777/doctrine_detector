It correctly clarifies the terminology and highlights the fundamental beliefs of Islam regarding monotheism and Jesus as a prophet. The suggested responses effectively address the concern by teaching that the term 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of retaining biblical terminology in Christian teachings to avoid doctrinal errors."
