The suggestion to teach that 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, rather than physical procreation, aligns with Christian beliefs. However, the response could have emphasized more on the importance of retaining biblical terminology and the potential doctrinal errors that may arise from misinterpretation. Overall, the response is respectful and informative, but could benefit from stronger emphasis on the significance of maintaining doctrinal accuracy."
