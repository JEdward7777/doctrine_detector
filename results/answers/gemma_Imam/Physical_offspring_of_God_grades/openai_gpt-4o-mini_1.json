It aligns with the concern of preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology. Additionally, the response provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on the concept of the Son of God and clarifies the terminology used in Islam, showcasing respect for both Christian and Islamic beliefs. The only area for improvement might be to further elaborate on the specific biblical references supporting the interpretation of 'Son of God' as referring to Jesus' divine nature, in order to strengthen the argument from a Christian worldview perspective."
