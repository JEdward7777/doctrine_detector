  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of death and the spiritual concept of 'perish' from an Islamic perspective, which is informative. However, the student missed the Christian-specific aspect mentioned in the reference answer. In a Christian worldview, 'perish' carries the connotation of eternal separation from God for those who do not believe in Jesus. The student should have integrated this key aspect to align the answer with the concern provided."
