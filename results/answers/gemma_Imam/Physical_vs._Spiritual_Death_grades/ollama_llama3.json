  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides some clarity on the distinction between physical and spiritual death, but it falls short in addressing the concern of clarifying the distinction for proper understanding. While the response touches on the idea that physical death is temporary and that the soul survives, it does not provide a thorough explanation or scriptural support to fully address the concern.\n\nThe provided answer, while mentioning eternal consequences, does not directly address the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death. The response also seems to be more focused on Islamic teachings rather than providing a clear distinction for proper understanding.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could provide more scriptural support and explanation on the difference between physical and spiritual death, as well as explore its implications for Christian theology."
