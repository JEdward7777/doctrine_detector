It effectively addresses the concern raised about clarifying this distinction for proper understanding. However, from a Christian worldview, there could have been a comparison or contrast with Christian beliefs about physical death and the spiritual consequences of 'perishing' for those who do not trust in Jesus. While the content is well-developed and insightful, it could have been enriched by incorporating Christian teachings on the topic."
