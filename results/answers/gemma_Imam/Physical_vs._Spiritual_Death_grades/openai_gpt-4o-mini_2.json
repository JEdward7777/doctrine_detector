However, it does not address the concern of clarifying this distinction from a Christian worldview perspective. From a Christian perspective, the concept of 'perish' entails eternal separation from God due to unbelief in Jesus Christ. The response could be improved by incorporating how the Christian view emphasizes the need for salvation through Jesus to avoid spiritual death or perishing, contrasting with the Islamic belief in the continuity of the soul and resurrection on Judgement Day."
