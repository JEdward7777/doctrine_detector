  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained interpretation of how to 'call out to the Lord' in Islamic prayers, emphasizing sincerity, humility, gratitude, and the use of specific supplications. While their answer focused on Islamic teachings and practices, they effectively addressed the concern about the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life. However, the answer could have incorporated more direct references to the Christian worldview and the concept of seeking God urgently for help, trusting in Him, and depending on Him, as specified in the teacher's reference answer."
