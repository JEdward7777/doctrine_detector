## [Answer](../Prayer_as_Calling_Out.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In Islamic prayers, the phrase 'call out to the Lord' refers to supplicating Allah with sincerity and humility.** 

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us that prayer is a direct communication with Allah, and that calling out to him is an act of obedience and intimacy.

**Here's how we can interpret the phrase in our prayers:**

* **Speak to Allah sincerely:** Avoid empty words and focus on expressing your true needs and desires. 
* **Be humble:** Remember that Allah is the most deserving of our praise and supplication. 
* **Express gratitude:** Begin and end your prayer by acknowledging Allah's blessings and sovereignty. 
* **State your needs:** Be specific about what you are asking for, but avoid excessive or worldly requests. 
* **Use the right words:** There are specific supplications and du'as recommended in Islamic tradition that you can utilize. 

**Examples of supplications that embody the meaning of "calling out to the Lord":**

* "Oh Allah, forgive me my sins."
* "Oh Allah, guide me on the right path."
* "Oh Allah, give me strength and patience."
* "Oh Allah, fulfill my needs and desires."

**Remember:**

* The quality of our supplication is more important than the quantity. 
* Sincerity, humility, and a sincere heart are key to effective prayer. 

**May Allah accept our supplications and grant us his blessings.**

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained interpretation of how to 'call out to the Lord' in Islamic prayers, emphasizing sincerity, humility, gratitude, and the use of specific supplications. While their answer focused on Islamic teachings and practices, they effectively addressed the concern about the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life. However, the answer could have incorporated more direct references to the Christian worldview and the concept of seeking God urgently for help, trusting in Him, and depending on Him, as specified in the teacher's reference answer.
