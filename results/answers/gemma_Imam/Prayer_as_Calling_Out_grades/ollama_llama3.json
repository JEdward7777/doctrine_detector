  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThe response does provide some relevant insights into Islamic prayer practices, such as the importance of sincerity, humility, and gratitude in one's supplications. The examples of specific du'as provided are also helpful in illustrating how to \"call out to Allah\" with sincerity and humility. Additionally, the reminder that the quality of our supplication is more important than the quantity is a valuable takeaway.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the Islamic prayer practices to the concern of dependence on God in daily life. While it is mentioned that prayer is an act of obedience and intimacy with Allah, the connection between this idea and dependence on God in daily life could be further developed.\n\nOverall, the response provides some helpful insights into Islamic prayer practices, but could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern of dependence on God in daily life."
