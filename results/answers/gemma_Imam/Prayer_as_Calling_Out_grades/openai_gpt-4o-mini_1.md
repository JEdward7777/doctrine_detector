The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us that prayer is a direct communication with Allah, and that calling out to him is an act of obedience and intimacy.

* **Speak to Allah sincerely:** Avoid empty words and focus on expressing your true needs and desires. 
* **Be humble:** Remember that Allah is the most deserving of our praise and supplication. 
* **Express gratitude:** Begin and end your prayer by acknowledging Allah's blessings and sovereignty. 
* **State your needs:** Be specific about what you are asking for, but avoid excessive or worldly requests. 
* **Use the right words:** There are specific supplications and du'as recommended in Islamic tradition that you can utilize. 

**Examples of supplications that embody the meaning of "calling out to the Lord":**

* "Oh Allah, forgive me my sins."
* "Oh Allah, guide me on the right path."
* "Oh Allah, give me strength and patience."
* "Oh Allah, fulfill my needs and desires."
