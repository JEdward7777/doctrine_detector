**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** While the student's response avoids making explicit reference to Christian doctrines, it accurately describes the essence of predestination as God's predetermination of certain individuals for salvation. This aligns with the reference answer from the teacher. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the theological basis for this belief in a Christian context.
