Comment: While the response acknowledges the concept of predestination in relation to salvation, it falls short in addressing the concern fully due to the stated limitation in providing interpretations beyond Islamic principles. In a Christian worldview, understanding predestination involves delving into theological perspectives and biblical passages that may differ from Islamic teachings.
