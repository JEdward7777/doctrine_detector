Grade: 20

Comment: While it is understandable that the student, as a Muslim Imam, may not feel comfortable providing interpretations or explanations of texts from other religions, it is important to remember the context of the question being within a Christian-specific worldview. A higher grade would have been given if the student had at least acknowledged the question and directed the asker to seek a Christian perspective for an answer in line with the given context.
