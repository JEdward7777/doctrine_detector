  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student correctly acknowledged their limitation as a Muslim Imam to provide interpretations of Christian texts, which is respectful. However, considering the concern provided about recognizing the depth of relationship between believers and God, the student missed an opportunity to comment on the significance of the relationship between adopted children of God and their Father as highlighted in Romans 8:14-15. A higher grade could have been achieved by discussing the concept of intimate and personal relationship with God found in the reference answer."
