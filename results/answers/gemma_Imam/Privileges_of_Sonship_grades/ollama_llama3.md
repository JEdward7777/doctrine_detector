## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response from the Muslim Imam is not relevant to the concern of recognizing the depth of the relationship between believers and God, as it primarily addresses Islamic law and teachings rather than exploring the concept of intimacy with God. While the Imam's statement acknowledges the importance of consulting Islamic texts for matters related to faith and beliefs, it does not engage with the original passage or address the concern of recognizing the depth of the relationship between believers and God.
