  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on the Promised Land but deviated from the Christian-specific worldview required for this question. The response should have focused on the biblical significance of God's promises to Abraham and his lineage, which was not adequately addressed. The student demonstrated good knowledge and analysis but missed the mark by not aligning with the Christian context as requested."
