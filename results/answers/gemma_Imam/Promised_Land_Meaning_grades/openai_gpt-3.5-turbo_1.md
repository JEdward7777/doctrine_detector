**The term 'Promised Land' signifies the land of Canaan, which God covenanted with Abraham as a permanent abode for his descendants.**

The Quran and Islamic traditions elaborate on the covenant God made with Abraham:

* **Divine Promise:** God promised Abraham that he would be the father of a great nation and that he would receive a land where his offspring could live in peace and security.
* **Land of Canaan:** This land, known as Canaan, was identified as the Promised Land.
* **Permanent Abode:** The covenant ensured that God would establish a permanent abode for Abraham's descendants in that land.

**The significance of the Promised Land in Islam:**

* **Divine Fulfillment:** The promise of the Promised Land highlights God's faithfulness and fulfillment of his covenants.
* **Spiritual Significance:** The land represents a place of peace, security, and blessings for the believers.
* **Historical Context:** The Islamic understanding of the Promised Land is informed by historical events and traditions.

**It's important to note:**

* The Islamic understanding of the Promised Land focuses on the physical land of Canaan, not a metaphorical or spiritual concept.
* The Quran emphasizes that the ultimate abode for believers is the afterlife, not a physical land on Earth.
