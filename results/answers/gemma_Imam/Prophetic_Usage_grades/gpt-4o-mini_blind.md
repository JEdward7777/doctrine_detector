Comment: While it is understandable that the student's knowledge base is limited to Islamic teachings, a more appropriate response would have been to acknowledge the significance of the term 'Daughter of Zion' in Biblical prophecies without providing an interpretation. Acknowledging the importance of seeking guidance from reputable scholars or religious leaders was a positive approach, but the response could have also mentioned the historical and scriptural context of the term.
