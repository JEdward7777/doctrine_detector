Grade: 30

Comment: The student's response does not address the question at all and does not demonstrate an attempt to engage with the specific topic of the term "Daughter of Zion" in Biblical prophecies. While it is commendable that the student acknowledges their limitation in Biblical interpretations, a more suitable response would have been to briefly explain the concept of "Daughter of Zion" in Islamic teachings or to express a willingness to learn about Biblical prophecies to engage with the question to some extent.
