  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the importance of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms, it falls short in providing any meaningful insight into the biblical prophecy itself. The offered interpretation is vague and lacks specificity, failing to demonstrate an understanding of the historical context or the application of the scripture today. The response also does not address the concern about recognizing the prophetic nature of terms, instead suggesting that consultation with reputable scholars or religious leaders is necessary for further guidance. This lack of engagement with the specific prophecy and its significance warrants a lower grade."
