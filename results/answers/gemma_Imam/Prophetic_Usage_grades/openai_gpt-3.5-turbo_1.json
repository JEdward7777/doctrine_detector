  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response is graded based on the provided concern on recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context to better apply the scriptures today. The initial response properly acknowledges the limitations of the responder's knowledge base and directs the inquiry to appropriate sources for Biblical interpretations. However, the response lacks an in-depth analysis of the given Biblical term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to its prophetic significance and historical context. A higher grade could have been achieved by offering additional insights or explanations based on a Christian perspective while emphasizing the importance of understanding the prophetic nature of Biblical terms for scriptural application today."
