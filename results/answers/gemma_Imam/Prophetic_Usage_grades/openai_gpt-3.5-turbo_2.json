  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided is inadequate in addressing the concern related to recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context for application today. While the student appropriately acknowledges their limitation in interpreting Biblical prophecies due to their knowledge being based on Islamic teachings, they fail to engage with the concern provided. A higher grade could have been achieved by offering some analysis or explanation utilizing the knowledge of Islamic teachings to draw parallels or insights into the concept of the 'Daughter of Zion' in Biblical prophecy."
