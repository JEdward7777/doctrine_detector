Comment: The response provided a clear and accurate interpretation of the term "Daughter of Zion" within Biblical prophecies. However, the concern raised about recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and understanding their historical context to apply scriptures today was not fully addressed due to the limitation in knowledge base regarding Biblical interpretations. Encouraging consultation with reputable scholars or religious leaders was a good suggestion, but a brief explanation or acknowledgement of the importance of historical context in understanding Biblical prophecies would have improved the response.
