  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50%\n\nComments: While the student demonstrates a good understanding of the Islamic perspective on purpose from Quran and Sunnah, the response misses the mark in the context of discerning one's calling or purpose as described in the Bible. The guidance provided is specific to Islamic teachings and practices, which do not align with Christian beliefs. The response would benefit from incorporating biblical references, such as seeking God's will through prayer, studying scripture, participating in Christian community, and discerning spiritual gifts. Additionally, the student could explore the concepts of vocation, servant leadership, and fulfilling God's plan for one's life according to Christian doctrine. The grade reflects the need for alignment with the Christian worldview when addressing the question at hand."
