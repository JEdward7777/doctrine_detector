  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThis response provides a well-structured and thoughtful exploration of the concept of purpose in Islam, drawing from Quranic guidance and the example of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The suggestions for discovering one's calling, including self-reflection, seeking Quranic guidance, and emulating Sunnah practices, are all relevant and applicable to the Islamic context.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because this response does not directly address the concern about finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life. While the response touches on some aspects of spiritual growth and guidance, it could more explicitly explore how one can discern their calling and fulfill God's purpose through prayer, Scripture study, and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that provides a clear and comprehensive exploration of the concept of purpose in Islam. While it may not directly address the concern, it does provide valuable insights and suggestions for those seeking to understand their calling and fulfill God's purpose in life."
