    * Seek guidance from the Quran, which provides insights into human potential and purpose.
    * Consult Islamic scholars and teachers for interpretations and guidance.
* **Sunnah Practices:**
    * The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) exemplified humility, generosity, and service to others.
    * Emulating his actions can provide clues about your potential calling.
