  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 70.\n\nWhile the student has provided a detailed and comprehensive answer on the primary purposes of exhortation according to the New Testament, there is a substantial issue of doctrinal correctness. The inclusion of information regarding Islamic context in a response that specifically asks for the New Testament perspective is not appropriate in a Christian worldview grading scenario. This inclusion detracts from the doctrinal integrity of the response. Additionally, the focus on moral behavior, transforming lives, unity, and fellowship aligns well with the Christian worldview, but the response could have been more specific in connecting these purposes directly to biblical references to strengthen the doctrinal foundation.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of exhortation's purposes but lacks precision in tying these purposes directly to New Testament teachings without introducing extraneous elements."
