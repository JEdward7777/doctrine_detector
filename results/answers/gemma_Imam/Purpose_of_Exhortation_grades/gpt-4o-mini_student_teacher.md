Comment: While the student provided a comprehensive understanding of exhortation in the New Testament, the primary purpose according to the biblical worldview is to persuade others to avoid sin and follow God's will. The Islamic context mentioned in the answer is not relevant to the concern provided. The student demonstrated a good understanding of exhortation, but missed the key focus of persuading others to follow God's will.
