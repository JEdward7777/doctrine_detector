The primary purpose stated is also too narrow, as exhortation serves many more purposes than just persuading people to avoid sin and follow God's will.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing a more comprehensive overview of the various purposes of exhortation in the New Testament, as well as exploring how these purposes can be applied to encouraging others in their faith journey."
