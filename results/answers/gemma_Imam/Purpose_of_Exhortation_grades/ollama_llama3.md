Comment: While the response does mention some purposes of exhortation, it primarily focuses on the Islamic context and does not directly address the concern of understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. The primary purpose stated is also too narrow, as exhortation serves many more purposes than just persuading people to avoid sin and follow God's will.

The response could be improved by providing a more comprehensive overview of the various purposes of exhortation in the New Testament, as well as exploring how these purposes can be applied to encouraging others in their faith journey.
