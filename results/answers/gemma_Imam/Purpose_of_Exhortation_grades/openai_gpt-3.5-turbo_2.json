However, the given answer focused solely on persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, lacking depth in addressing the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, which is a key aspect of exhortation in the Christian worldview. More emphasis on the biblical foundation for strengthening and inspiring believers in their faith walk could have further enhanced the response."
