Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the purposes of exhortation in the New Testament, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the primary purpose stated in the given answer, focusing on persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, lacks depth and does not directly address the concern regarding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. Consequently, the response does not fully integrate the specific concern provided.
