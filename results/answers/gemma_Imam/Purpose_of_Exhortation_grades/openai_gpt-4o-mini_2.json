The response provided a comprehensive overview of the purposes of exhortation in the New Testament and even contrasted it with the Islamic context, which demonstrates critical thinking. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey within a Christian worldview. Further elaboration on specific biblical passages or principles related to this concept would have strengthened the response."
