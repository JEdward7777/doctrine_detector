Grade: 50

Comment: While the answer provides some practical suggestions for living a holy life, the foundational perspective presented is from Islam rather than Christianity. It is essential to provide a distinctly Christian worldview on holiness and living a life set apart for God's purpose. The importance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate example and Savior should have been emphasized, along with the key doctrines of grace, faith, and sanctification. Additionally, referencing God's Word, the Bible, as the primary source of guidance for Christian living is crucial. The inclusion of elements such as witnessing for God, humility, and social justice align well with Christian values, but the response lacks a solid doctrinal foundation in Christian beliefs. Therefore, the grade reflects the need to align the provided principles more closely with Christian teachings.
