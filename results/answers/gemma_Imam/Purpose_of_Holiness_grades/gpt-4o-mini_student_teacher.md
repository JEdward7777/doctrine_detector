Grade: 50

Comment: The student's response provides a thorough overview of living a holy life from an Islamic perspective, but it does not specifically address the question from a Christian worldview. While many of the principles mentioned align with Christian values, the emphasis should have been on the teachings of Jesus Christ and the instructions given in the Bible regarding holiness. The student should focus on incorporating Christian beliefs and practices when answering questions from a Christian-specific worldview.
