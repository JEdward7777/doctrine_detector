Comment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the primary purposes of Jesus using parables in his teachings from a general perspective. They have grasped the accessibility, challenging nature, emotional engagement, and illustrative functions of parables well. The student could have strengthened their answer by incorporating specific biblical references or examples of parables used by Jesus to support their points. Additionally, emphasizing the transformative aspect of parables and how they were used to separate those who were receptive to spiritual truths from those who were not would have further enriched their response. Overall, a solid explanation with room for more depth and biblical grounding.
