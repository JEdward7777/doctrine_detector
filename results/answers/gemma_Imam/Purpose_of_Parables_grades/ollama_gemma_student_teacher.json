  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thorough response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the purpose of Jesus' parables. The student provides several accurate and insightful points, including their accessibility to ordinary people, their ability to challenge preconceptions, and their effectiveness in illustrating spiritual concepts. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview by referencing Jesus' divine authority and his intention to reveal spiritual truth to believers while concealing it from those who rejected it."
