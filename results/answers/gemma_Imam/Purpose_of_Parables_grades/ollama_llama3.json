  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 70.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that Jesus used parables to teach moral truths, which aligns with some of the options provided (e.g., \"Illustrate spiritual concepts and principles\"). However, it lacks depth and nuance in its understanding of why Jesus used parables. The concern is about understanding Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith, but this response primarily focuses on the content being taught rather than the method itself.\n\nA higher score would require a more comprehensive explanation of Jesus' use of parables, including their ability to engage hearts and imaginations, challenge preconceptions, and make his teachings accessible to ordinary people. The response also does not fully address the concern about implications for faith, as it primarily focuses on the act of teaching moral truths rather than exploring how parables might shape our understanding of God or our relationship with Him.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more insight into why Jesus chose to use parables and how they relate to his broader ministry and message."
