  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a concise and accurate understanding of why Jesus used parables in his teachings, highlighting the dual purpose of both revealing truth to his disciples and concealing it from those who did not believe. The concern regarding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith is directly addressed and supported by the response provided. However, the response could be further enriched by including the deeper spiritual insights and transformative nature of parables in relation to faith development."
