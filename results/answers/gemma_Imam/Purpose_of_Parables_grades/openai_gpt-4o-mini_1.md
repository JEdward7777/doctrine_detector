Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of the purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings, emphasizing accessibility, challenge to preconceptions, emotional engagement, illustration of spiritual concepts, and opening up spiritual understanding. However, it falls short in mentioning the key aspect of Jesus using parables to both reveal truth to his disciples and to hide it from unbelievers, which is significant in understanding the deeper implications of Jesus' teaching methods for faith.
