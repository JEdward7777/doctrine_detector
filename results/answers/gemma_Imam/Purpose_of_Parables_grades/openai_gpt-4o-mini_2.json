  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provided a solid understanding of the primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings, particularly in making his teachings accessible and engaging the hearts of his audience. However, the answer given in the response is slightly limited in capturing the full depth and purpose of Jesus' use of parables, especially in relation to challenging preconceptions, engaging imaginations, and opening up spiritual understanding. Consider addressing these aspects more explicitly in order to provide a more comprehensive analysis from a Christian worldview."
