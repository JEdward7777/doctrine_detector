Comment: The response acknowledges the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life, which aligns with a Christian worldview. However, the student's limitation in providing insights from the Bible due to their Islamic background is noted. It would have been stronger if the student had attempted to incorporate some biblical references or principles in their answer, even with their disclaimer.
