  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing various ways the Psalms were used in worship practices of the nation of Israel. However, the answer lacked a focus on the essential aspect of expressing a range of emotions such as joy, faith, reverence, pain, and sorrow, which was the key emphasis in the teacher's reference answer. Encouraging the student to deepen their understanding of the emotional depth conveyed through the Psalms in the context of worship practices would enhance their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
