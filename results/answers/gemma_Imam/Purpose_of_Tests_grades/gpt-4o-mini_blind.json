The inclusion of relevant teachings from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) adds authenticity to the response. However, to align more closely with a Christian worldview, the answer could have emphasized the sovereignty and providence of God in allowing tests, as well as the aspect of sanctification through trials. Additionally, attributing the testing of faith to demonstrate completeness could be further explained within the context of God's refining work in believers' lives."
