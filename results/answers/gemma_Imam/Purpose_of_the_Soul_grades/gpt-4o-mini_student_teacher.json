  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provides detailed information about the soul in Islam and its relationship with God as described in the Quran, the response does not align with the Christian perspective. The Christian worldview focuses on the Bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ rather than the Quran. Additionally, the answer does not address the concern provided, which is about how recognizing the soul's role in relation to God can influence a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. Thus, the grade is low because the answer does not effectively connect the concept of the soul and its relationship with God to the given concern from a Christian perspective."
