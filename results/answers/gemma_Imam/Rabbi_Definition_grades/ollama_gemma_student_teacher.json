However, the answer could have elaborated on the historical and cultural context of the term 'Rabbi' within Judaism, including its role as a title for respected spiritual leaders and teachers. Additionally, the answer could have acknowledged the significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, even though the term 'Rabbi' itself is not explicitly used in that context."
