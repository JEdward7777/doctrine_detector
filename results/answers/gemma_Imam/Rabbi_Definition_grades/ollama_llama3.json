  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response correctly notes that the term \"Rabbi\" has different meanings in Christian and Islamic contexts, which shows some understanding of the concern to understand the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. However, it does not directly address the concern or provide insight into how rabbinic teaching is presented in the New Testament.\n\nThe response also does not engage with the definition provided as an answer, instead focusing on the general difference between Christian and Islamic usage of the term \"Rabbi\". A stronger response would have connected the meaning of \"Rabbi\" to its significance in the New Testament, such as discussing how Jesus referred to himself as the Rabbi (Teacher) or how early Christian leaders were influenced by Jewish rabbinic teaching.\n\nComment: While this response takes a step towards understanding the context and significance of the term \"Rabbi\", it could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern and engaging with the provided definition."
