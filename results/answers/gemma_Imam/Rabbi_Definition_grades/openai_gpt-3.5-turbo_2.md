Grade: 50

Comment: The response correctly defines the term 'Rabbi' as meaning 'my master' or 'my teacher' in Jewish religious teaching. However, the response does not address the concern of understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament from a Christian perspective. To improve the grade, the response should discuss how rabbinic teaching influences Christian understanding of Jesus as the ultimate teacher and guide.
