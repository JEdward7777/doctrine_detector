  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response correctly defines the term 'Rabbi' in its cultural and historical context. However, the concern relates specifically to understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, which the provided response does not directly address. To improve the grade, the response could have elaborated on how rabbinic teaching may have influenced or interacted with Christian teaching in the New Testament."
