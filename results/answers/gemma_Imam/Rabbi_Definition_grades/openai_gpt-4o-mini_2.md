Grade: 80

Comment: The response correctly defines the term 'Rabbi' as "my master" or "my teacher" in the context of Jewish religious teaching. However, it falls short in connecting this understanding to the significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. To improve the grade, the response could have elaborated on how rabbinic teaching influenced or interacted with Christian teachings in the New Testament.
