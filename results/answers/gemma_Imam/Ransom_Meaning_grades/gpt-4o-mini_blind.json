The focus should have been on the Christian perspective on Jesus' sacrificial death as the ransom for the sins of humanity, emphasizing the theological implications and significance within Christian doctrine. The answer could have also discussed the atonement theology and the biblical basis for understanding Jesus as the ultimate ransom."
