## [Answer](../Ransom_Meaning.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic context, the concept of Jesus as a ransom is not considered to be in accordance with Islamic beliefs.**

The Islamic faith believes that Jesus is a prophet of God, but it does not endorse the Christian belief in his crucifixion as a ransom for sins.

**Islamic teachings emphasize that salvation is through faith in Allah and obedience to his laws.**
