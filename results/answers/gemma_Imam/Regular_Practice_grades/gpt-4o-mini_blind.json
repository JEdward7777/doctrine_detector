  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response is accurate in pointing out that the Apostle Paul was not a Muslim Imam and that the Lord's Supper is a central practice in Christianity, not Islam. However, the answer does not directly address the question regarding why Paul established the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. The grade would be higher if the student provided more information about the significance and purpose of the Lord's Supper in the Christian faith, as well as Paul's role in promoting this practice."
