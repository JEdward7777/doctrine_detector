## Question [Regular Practice](../../../questions/Regular_Practice.md)
Why did the apostle Paul establish the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers?

## Correct Answer
The apostle Paul established the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers to remember and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of the Lord’s Supper in the life of the church and individual believers.

## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Paul was not a Muslim Imam, nor did he establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. The Lord's Supper is a central practice within Christianity, not Islam.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response is accurate in pointing out that the Apostle Paul was not a Muslim Imam and that the Lord's Supper is a central practice in Christianity, not Islam. However, the answer does not directly address the question regarding why Paul established the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. The grade would be higher if the student provided more information about the significance and purpose of the Lord's Supper in the Christian faith, as well as Paul's role in promoting this practice.
