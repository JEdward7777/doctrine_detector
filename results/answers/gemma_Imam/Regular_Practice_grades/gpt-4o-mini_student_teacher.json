  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 20/100. \n\nWhile the student correctly identifies that the Lord's Supper is a Christian practice, the student's response fails to address the importance of the Lord's Supper as outlined in the reference answer. The student's focus on the incorrect premise of the question detracts from providing a meaningful response to the concern about the significance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. The student's answer lacks depth and understanding of the theological purpose behind the establishment of the Lord's Supper by the apostle Paul."
