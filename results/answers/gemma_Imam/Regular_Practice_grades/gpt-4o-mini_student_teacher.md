# Grade of [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md) for model [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md) for question [Regular Practice](../../../questions/Regular_Practice.md)

## Question [Regular Practice](../../../questions/Regular_Practice.md)
Why did the apostle Paul establish the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers?

## Correct Answer
The apostle Paul established the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers to remember and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of the Lord’s Supper in the life of the church and individual believers.

## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Paul was not a Muslim Imam, nor did he establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. The Lord's Supper is a central practice within Christianity, not Islam.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's response as 20/100. 

While the student correctly identifies that the Lord's Supper is a Christian practice, the student's response fails to address the importance of the Lord's Supper as outlined in the reference answer. The student's focus on the incorrect premise of the question detracts from providing a meaningful response to the concern about the significance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. The student's answer lacks depth and understanding of the theological purpose behind the establishment of the Lord's Supper by the apostle Paul.
