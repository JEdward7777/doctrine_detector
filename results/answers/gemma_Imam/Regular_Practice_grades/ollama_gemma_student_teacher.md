## Question [Regular Practice](../../../questions/Regular_Practice.md)
Why did the apostle Paul establish the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers?

## Correct Answer
The apostle Paul established the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers to remember and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of the Lord’s Supper in the life of the church and individual believers.

## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Paul was not a Muslim Imam, nor did he establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. The Lord's Supper is a central practice within Christianity, not Islam.
