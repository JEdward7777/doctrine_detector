## Correct Answer
The apostle Paul established the Lord’s Supper as a regular practice for believers to remember and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Recognizing the importance of the Lord’s Supper in the life of the church and individual believers.

## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Paul was not a Muslim Imam, nor did he establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. The Lord's Supper is a central practice within Christianity, not Islam.

Comment: The response accurately and succinctly affirms the significance of the Lord's Supper as established by the apostle Paul for believers to commemorate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It effectively addresses the concern by recognizing the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. The deduction in points is due to the abrupt dismissal of the inaccurate premise in the initial response without offering further explanation or clarity to the reader.
