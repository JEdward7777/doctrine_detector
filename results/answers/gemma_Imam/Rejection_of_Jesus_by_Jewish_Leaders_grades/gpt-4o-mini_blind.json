The points are well-articulated and demonstrate an understanding of the theological dynamics at play. One area for improvement could be further elaborating on how the rejection of Jesus by Jewish leaders highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus as the Messiah. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of understanding and respecting differing theological perspectives in a more explicitly Christian context would enhance the answer. Overall, a strong response with room for minor refinement."
