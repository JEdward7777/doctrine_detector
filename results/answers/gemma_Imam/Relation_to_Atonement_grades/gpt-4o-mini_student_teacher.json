  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response confuses Islamic theology with a Christian specific worldview. In Christian theology, 'propitiation' and 'atonement' are distinct concepts where 'propitiation' specifically focuses on appeasing God's wrath through Christ's sacrifice, while 'atonement' refers to the broader concept of reconciliation and forgiveness of sins. The student's answer fails to accurately address the differences and similarities between these two important theological terms within a Christian framework."
