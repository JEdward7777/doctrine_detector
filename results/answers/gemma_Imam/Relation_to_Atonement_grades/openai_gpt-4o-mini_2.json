It effectively clarifies the distinctions in how these terms are understood and practiced, offering a comprehensive understanding of the concepts. However, from a Christian perspective, it would be important to also highlight the unique aspects of atonement in Christianity, particularly emphasizing the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins."
