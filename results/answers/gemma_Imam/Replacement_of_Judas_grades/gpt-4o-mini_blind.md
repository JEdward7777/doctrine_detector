Comment: The response accurately points out that there is no historical evidence or Islamic tradition supporting the replacement of Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. However, from a Christian worldview, the replacement of Judas Iscariot is based on the biblical account in Acts 1:15-26 where Matthias was chosen to replace him. The answer would benefit from mentioning this perspective to align with Christian beliefs.
