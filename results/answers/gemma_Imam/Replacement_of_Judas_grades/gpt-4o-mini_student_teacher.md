Grade: 40

Comment: The student's answer is partially correct in stating that there is no Islamic tradition about Judas Iscariot being replaced among the twelve apostles, but it overlooks the Christian perspective. The accurate Christian viewpoint is that Matthias was indeed chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, ensuring the continuity of apostolic leadership. The student's response demonstrates some knowledge, but it lacks the key information from a Christian worldview.
