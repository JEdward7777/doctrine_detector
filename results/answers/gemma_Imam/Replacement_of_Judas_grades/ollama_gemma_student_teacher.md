70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
## Grade: 70/100

**Comment:** While the student correctly points out the lack of historical evidence for Judas Iscariot being replaced among the twelve apostles, they could have elaborated on the continuity of apostolic leadership by mentioning Matthias' subsequent inclusion as an apostle. Their answer adequately addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, but could have offered more detail.
