  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension by correctly stating that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, thereby maintaining the original apostolic team. The response also provides a clear and concise answer to the specific question about who replaced Judas.\n\nHowever, the grade is not higher because the response does not provide additional context or insight into the significance of this event in terms of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership. While it accurately answers the question, it does not particularly shed light on the concern beyond simply providing the correct answer.\n\nComment: This response effectively addresses the concern and provides a clear answer to the question, but could benefit from additional context or reflection on the significance of Matthias' selection in terms of maintaining the original apostolic team."
