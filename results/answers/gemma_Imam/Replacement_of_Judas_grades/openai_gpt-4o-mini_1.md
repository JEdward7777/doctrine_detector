## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 95

Comment: The response accurately addresses the concern by acknowledging the continuity of apostolic leadership through the replacement of Judas Iscariot with Matthias. It aligns with the Christian belief of apostolic succession as seen in the Bible. The deduction from a perfect score is due to potentially being more explicit in tying Matthias' selection to the continuation of Jesus' ministry through the apostles.
