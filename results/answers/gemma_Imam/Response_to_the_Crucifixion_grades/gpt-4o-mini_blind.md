Grade: 20

Comment: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information in historical accounts about Peter addressing the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. However, from a Christian worldview, a more appropriate approach would have been to consider Peter's speeches in Acts, particularly in Acts 2 where he does address the crowd about their role in Jesus' crucifixion. This shows a missed opportunity to connect the question to relevant biblical narratives.
