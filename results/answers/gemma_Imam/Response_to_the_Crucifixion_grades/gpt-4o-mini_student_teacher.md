Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer lacks the key information about Peter addressing the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. It is important to recognize the significance of Peter's message in emphasizing repentance and faith in response to the gospel. A Christian worldview places emphasis on acknowledging one's sinfulness and the need for redemption through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.
