  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response correctly acknowledges the absence of explicit information in the historical accounts regarding Peter addressing the crowd about their role in the crucifixion. However, it could have elaborated on the broader context of Peter's ministry and how he may have implicitly addressed the crowd's responsibility through his sermons and teachings. The reference answer provides additional insight into Peter's perspective, emphasizing the resurrection and the need for repentance."
