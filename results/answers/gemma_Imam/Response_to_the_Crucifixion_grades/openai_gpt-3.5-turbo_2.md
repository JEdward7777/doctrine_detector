Comment: The response provided does not directly address the concern regarding evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel. It does not draw on Christian teachings or perspectives to analyze Peter's message to the crowd. The response acknowledges the lack of specific information in historical accounts, but it falls short of engaging with the context and implications for the early church's preaching.
