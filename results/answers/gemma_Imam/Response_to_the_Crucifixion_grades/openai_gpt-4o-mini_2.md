Grade: 40

Comment: The response correctly recognizes the importance of Peter's message about the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, calling for repentance and faith. However, the initial response lacks engagement with the Christian worldview that emphasizes the collective responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion and the need for a personal response to the gospel. The student should have acknowledged the early church's consistent preaching on these themes and the call for individuals to personally respond to the message of Jesus. More integration of Christian teachings into the response would have significantly improved the grade.
