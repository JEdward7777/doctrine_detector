However, from a Christian worldview, there are doctrinal differences concerning the means and implications of restoration. The answer would benefit from explicitly contrasting Islamic beliefs with Christian beliefs, particularly regarding the role of Jesus Christ as the mediator of reconciliation between God and sinful humanity. Additionally, incorporating key Christian scriptures and theological principles related to redemption and restoration would strengthen the response."
