  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of God restoring sinful people back to Himself within the Islamic faith. The response clearly outlines the process of istighfar and tawbah, referencing relevant Quranic verses and examples from Islamic tradition. While the answer aligns with the Islamic perspective, it does not directly address the Christian-specific worldview or concern related to reconciliation in the Christian faith as specified in the prompt."
