## [Answer](../Resurrection_Definition.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In a Christian context, the term 'resurrection' refers to the belief that Jesus Christ physically rose from the dead after his crucifixion and burial.** This event is central to Christianity and is considered the foundational belief of faith in Jesus as the Son of God.

**The Quran does not explicitly mention the resurrection of Jesus Christ.** However, it is compatible with Islamic beliefs in the afterlife and the potential for physical resurrection in the Hereafter.

**Muslims believe that Jesus was a prophet and messenger of God, but they do not believe in his crucifixion or resurrection in the same way as Christians.** The Islamic understanding of the afterlife emphasizes spiritual resurrection and purification rather than physical resurrection.

**The Quranic concept of 'qiyamah' (resurrection) refers to the final resurrection of all humanity at the end of time, when God will reunite the bodies and souls of the deceased. This event is seen as the ultimate triumph of God's power and justice.**
