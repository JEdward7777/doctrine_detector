  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a Christian-specific interpretation and fails to directly address the concern of promoting a spirit of grace rather than judgment within Christian communities. The response focuses more on Islamic principles and perspectives rather than providing a Christian worldview on the topic. Additionally, the practical implications and conclusion do not tie back effectively to the reference answer provided by the teacher. Further integration of Christian teachings and a deeper exploration of how Luke 6:37 informs the approach to judging others within a Christian context would have strengthened the response."
