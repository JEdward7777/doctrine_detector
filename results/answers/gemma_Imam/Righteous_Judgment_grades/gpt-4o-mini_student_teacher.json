  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured answer that addresses the concern of reconciling God's wrath with His loving and merciful nature from a Christian perspective. They effectively highlighted key points on God's character, the purpose of God's wrath, the abundance of His mercy, the balance of His justice, and the ultimate goal of God's wrath for our good. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references also strengthens their argument. However, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes God's wrath as a part of His justice and holiness more directly, so the student's answer could have placed slightly more emphasis on this aspect. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response."
