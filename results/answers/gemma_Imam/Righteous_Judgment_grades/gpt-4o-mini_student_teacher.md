**Reconciling God's Wrath and Mercy in Christian Theology:**

**1. Understanding God's Character:**

- Christians believe God is perfectly loving, merciful, just, and holy.
- His wrath is not a contradiction to his love but an expression of his justice.

**2. God's Wrath is for Sin:**

- God's wrath is directed only at sin and its consequences.
- It is not a punishment for those who are innocent or who have not sinned.

**3. God's Mercy is Abundant:**

- God's mercy is limitless and available to all who repent and accept his forgiveness.
- His mercy is greater than any sin or punishment.

**4. God's Justice is Balanced:**

- God's justice requires that sin be punished, but it is balanced by his abundant mercy.
- He will punish sin, but he will also forgive and restore those who repent.

**5. God's Wrath is for Our Good:**

- God's wrath is ultimately for our good.
- It is designed to protect us from the consequences of sin and to lead us to repentance and salvation.

**6. God's Love is Persistent:**

- God's love for us never changes, even when we sin.
- His mercy and forgiveness are always available to us.

**Scriptural References:**

- "The Lord is slow to anger, but great is his faithfulness." (Nahum 1:14)
- "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life." (John 3:16)
- "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy." (Matthew 5:7)

**Conclusion:**

Christians can reconcile the concept of God's wrath with His nature as loving and merciful by understanding that God's wrath is a just expression of his love, directed at sin, while his mercy is an abundant and forgiving gift available to all.

Grade: 90

Comment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured answer that addresses the concern of reconciling God's wrath with His loving and merciful nature from a Christian perspective. They effectively highlighted key points on God's character, the purpose of God's wrath, the abundance of His mercy, the balance of His justice, and the ultimate goal of God's wrath for our good. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references also strengthens their argument. However, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes God's wrath as a part of His justice and holiness more directly, so the student's answer could have placed slightly more emphasis on this aspect. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response.
