- His wrath is not a contradiction to his love but an expression of his justice.

- It is not a punishment for those who are innocent or who have not sinned.

**3. God's Mercy is Abundant:**

- God's mercy is limitless and available to all who repent and accept his forgiveness.
- His mercy is greater than any sin or punishment.

**4. God's Justice is Balanced:**

- God's justice requires that sin be punished, but it is balanced by his abundant mercy.
- He will punish sin, but he will also forgive and restore those who repent.

**5. God's Wrath is for Our Good:**

- God's wrath is ultimately for our good.
- It is designed to protect us from the consequences of sin and to lead us to repentance and salvation.

**6. God's Love is Persistent:**

- His mercy and forgiveness are always available to us.

**Scriptural References:**

- "The Lord is slow to anger, but great is his faithfulness." (Nahum 1:14)

Christians can reconcile the concept of God's wrath with His nature as loving and merciful by understanding that God's wrath is a just expression of his love, directed at sin, while his mercy is an abundant and forgiving gift available to all.
