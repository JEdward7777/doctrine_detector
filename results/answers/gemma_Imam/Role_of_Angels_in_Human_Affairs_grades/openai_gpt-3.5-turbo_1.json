  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the provided response acknowledges some aspects of angels serving God, it lacks depth and specificity compared to the detailed roles of angels outlined in the response based on Islamic references. In a Christian worldview, understanding the distinct roles of angels as messengers, protectors, witnesses, intercessors, helpers, and providers of spiritual support can significantly impact how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives. More explicit connection to Christian beliefs and scriptures would have improved the grade."
