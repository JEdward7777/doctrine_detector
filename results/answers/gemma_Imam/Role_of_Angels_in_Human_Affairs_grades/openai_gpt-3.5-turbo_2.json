While the response touches on delivering messages, providing protection, and strengthening believers, it does not delve into the nuanced roles of angels as messengers, guardians, witnesses, intercessors, helpers, and spiritual supporters as outlined in the biblical references. A deeper exploration of these roles would have enhanced the explanation and better aligned with a Christian specific worldview."
