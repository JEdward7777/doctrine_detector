  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of how angels serve God based on the given answer, highlighting their roles in delivering messages, providing protection, and strengthening believers. However, the concern raised about how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives is not entirely addressed. The response focuses more on the Islamic perspective of angels rather than providing insight from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the response should have included how understanding the roles of angels in Christianity can shape believers' understanding of God's intervention and presence in their lives."
