Grade: 85

This response demonstrates a good understanding of community and teaching as integral aspects of church life, as modeled by the apostles. The answer highlights the importance of fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer in the growth and unity of the early church, which is consistent with the biblical account. However, it does not fully capture the scope of the apostles' efforts to establish a strong foundation for community, engage believers actively, foster supportive relationships, promote shared responsibility, strengthen community through acts of service, decentralize power, learn from diverse perspectives, and celebrate collective achievements.

To reach a higher grade, the response could provide more specific examples or details about how the apostles implemented these principles in their ministry.
