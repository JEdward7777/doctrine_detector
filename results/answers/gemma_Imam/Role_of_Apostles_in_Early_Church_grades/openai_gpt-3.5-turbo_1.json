  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the foundational aspects of teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer as emphasized by the apostles, demonstrating a strong understanding of these integral aspects of church life. The response elaborates on how the apostles established clear communal identity, engaged actively in teaching, fostered supportive relationships, promoted shared responsibility, strengthened the community through acts of service, encouraged decentralization and empowerment, learned from diverse perspectives, and celebrated collective achievements. The response effectively connects these principles to the Christian worldview and the biblical model set by the apostles."
