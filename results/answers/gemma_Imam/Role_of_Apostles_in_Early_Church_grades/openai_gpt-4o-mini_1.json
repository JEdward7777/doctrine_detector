The suggestions for establishing clear communal identity, fostering supportive relationships, promoting shared responsibility, and other aspects reflect a solid understanding of the integral role of community and teaching in church life. The only area for improvement could be further emphasizing the aspect of prayer within the community practices highlighted."
