However, the concern raised about understanding the importance of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith was not directly addressed in the response. It would have been beneficial to tie in the concept of sacrifice and atonement, such as connecting the Passover lamb to Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for sin in the Christian belief system."
