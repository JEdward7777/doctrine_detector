## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
This answer does not directly engage with the question asked from a Christian worldview perspective. The student has avoided discussing the topic of eunuchs in ancient times, which is essential to form a comprehensive response in line with the worldview being evaluated. While sensitivity to diverse perspectives is important, in this context, a Christian perspective on the roles of eunuchs in ancient times is expected.

Grade: 30

Comment: The response lacks the expected analysis and discussion from a Christian worldview, which is crucial for addressing the question effectively. Engaging with the topic would have improved the grade significantly.
