  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a valid concern about discussing sensitive topics with respect and sensitivity. However, the student did not directly engage with the Christian worldview perspective requested in the concern. The response lacked a reflection on the inherent value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, irrespective of their physical or social status."
