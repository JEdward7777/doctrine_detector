**The Kingdom of God in Islamic Perspective:**

The Islamic understanding of the Kingdom of God emphasizes its spiritual and ethical dimensions, rather than a political or territorial dominion.

**Jesus' Role as Messiah:**

In Islam, Jesus (Isa) is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but not the Messiah in the Islamic sense. The Islamic Messiah is expected to be a descendant of Abraham and Muhammad.

**Relationship between the Kingdom and Jesus:**

While Islamic teachings acknowledge Jesus' spiritual authority and miracles, the concept of the Kingdom of God in Islam focuses on the triumph of righteousness and justice, not on a physical conquest or earthly kingdom.

**Jesus as a Symbol of Spiritual Transformation:**

In Islamic tradition, Jesus represents spiritual transformation, purity, and forgiveness. His role is to remind people of God's mercy and compassion.

**The Ultimate Goal: God's Kingdom**

The ultimate goal in Islam is the establishment of God's Kingdom, which refers to the triumph of Allah's law and values over corruption and injustice. This is seen as a spiritual and ethical transformation rather than a political conquest.

**Conclusion:**

The concept of the Kingdom of God in Islam emphasizes spiritual transformation, ethical values, and the triumph of righteousness. Jesus' role as a prophet and messenger is recognized, but his connection to the Kingdom of God is primarily seen as symbolic of spiritual renewal and forgiveness.
