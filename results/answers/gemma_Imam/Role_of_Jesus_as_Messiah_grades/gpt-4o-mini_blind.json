The response should have focused more on the biblical understanding of Jesus as the Messiah and His connection to establishing God's Kingdom on earth as foretold in the Old Testament. Additionally, it lacks a comparison or contrast with Christian beliefs, which would have enhanced the analysis. Overall, more emphasis on Jesus as the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies and His role in inaugurating God's Kingdom would have strengthened the argument."
