However, it lacks engagement with the specific concern of the question, which focuses on the Christian worldview. The response correctly highlights the spiritual and ethical dimensions of the Kingdom of God in Islam, but fails to address the connection between Jesus' earthly reign and his role as the Messiah in the Christian belief."
