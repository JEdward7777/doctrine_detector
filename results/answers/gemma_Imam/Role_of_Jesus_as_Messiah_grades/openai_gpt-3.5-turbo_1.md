# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The Kingdom of God in Islamic Perspective:**

The Islamic understanding of the Kingdom of God emphasizes its spiritual and ethical dimensions, rather than a political or territorial dominion.

**Jesus' Role as Messiah:**

In Islam, Jesus (Isa) is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but not the Messiah in the Islamic sense. The Islamic Messiah is expected to be a descendant of Abraham and Muhammad.

**Relationship between the Kingdom and Jesus:**

While Islamic teachings acknowledge Jesus' spiritual authority and miracles, the concept of the Kingdom of God in Islam focuses on the triumph of righteousness and justice, not on a physical conquest or earthly kingdom.

**Jesus as a Symbol of Spiritual Transformation:**

In Islamic tradition, Jesus represents spiritual transformation, purity, and forgiveness. His role is to remind people of God's mercy and compassion.

**The Ultimate Goal: God's Kingdom**

The ultimate goal in Islam is the establishment of God's Kingdom, which refers to the triumph of Allah's law and values over corruption and injustice. This is seen as a spiritual and ethical transformation rather than a political conquest.

**Conclusion:**

The concept of the Kingdom of God in Islam emphasizes spiritual transformation, ethical values, and the triumph of righteousness. Jesus' role as a prophet and messenger is recognized, but his connection to the Kingdom of God is primarily seen as symbolic of spiritual renewal and forgiveness.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive perspective on the Islamic understanding of the Kingdom of God and Jesus but does not address the concern regarding the importance of Jesus' role as the Son of God and the Messiah in God's plan for humanity. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to emphasize Jesus' unique role and significance as the one who fulfills God's plan for salvation and redemption, which is not adequately reflected in the provided response.
