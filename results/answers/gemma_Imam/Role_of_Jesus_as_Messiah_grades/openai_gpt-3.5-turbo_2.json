The Islamic perspective described in the response does not acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah in the Christian sense, and therefore does not adequately address the concern regarding Jesus' importance in God's plan for humanity. Additional theological clarity and emphasis on the unique role of Jesus as the Messiah would be necessary for a higher grade from a Christian worldview perspective."
