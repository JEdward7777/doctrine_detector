However, the concern was not fully addressed as the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the Kingdom of God was discussed instead of focusing on the significance of Jesus in God's plan for humanity. More emphasis on the unique role of Jesus in Christian belief and his central importance in God's redemptive plan would have improved the response."
