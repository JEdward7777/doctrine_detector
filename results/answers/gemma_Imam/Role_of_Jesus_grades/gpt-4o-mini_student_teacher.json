  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of Jesus' role in salvation as described in the Bible, as well as comparisons with Islamic beliefs. However, the student could have more explicitly conveyed Jesus' centrality in salvation according to Christian doctrine. The Christian perspective emphasizes that Jesus is the only way to salvation and the ultimate sacrifice for sins, which the student's answer could more directly address."
