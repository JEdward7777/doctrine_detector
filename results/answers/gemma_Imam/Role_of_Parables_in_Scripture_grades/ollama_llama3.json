  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, particularly in the story of Nathan and David. The writer provides specific examples from the passage to support their analysis, showing a good grasp of the text's meaning and significance.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more concise and focused on the main point. Some of the sentences are wordy or repetitive, which makes the text harder to follow. Additionally, while the writer does a great job highlighting the effectiveness of Nathan's parable, they could have delved deeper into the biblical context and implications.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that shows a clear understanding of the use of parables in biblical narratives and how they can be used for correction and revelation."
