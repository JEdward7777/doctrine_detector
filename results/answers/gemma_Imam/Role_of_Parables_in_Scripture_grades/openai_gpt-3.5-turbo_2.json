The explanation of how the parable exposed the moral consequences of David's actions and challenged his pride and self-justification is thorough and well-supported. The response also effectively highlights the impact of the parable in leading David to acknowledge his sin, repent, and seek reconciliation with God. Overall, the analysis is insightful and offers a comprehensive perspective on the significance of using parables for correction and revelation in the Bible. Great job!"
