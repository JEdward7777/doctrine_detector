## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The prophet Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David by comparing the king's impending act of taking Bathsheba as his wife to a transgression as severe as the deliberate killing of an innocent lamb belonging to God. This parable served two purposes:

**1. To expose the moral consequences of David's actions:**
- By drawing a parallel between the lamb and Bathsheba, Nathan highlighted the immense suffering and violation David would inflict upon an innocent individual.
- The lamb represented purity and sacrifice, symbolizing the vulnerability and sanctity of life.

**2. To challenge David's pride and self-justification:**
- By presenting the parable as a direct judgement from God, Nathan bypassed David's usual justifications based on his royal status.
- The parable stripped David of his supposed authority and forced him to confront the true consequences of his actions.

The use of this parable was highly effective as it:

* Allowed David to fully grasp the gravity of his sin.
* Forced him to acknowledge God's justice and accountability.
* Opened his heart to repentance and reconciliation with God.
