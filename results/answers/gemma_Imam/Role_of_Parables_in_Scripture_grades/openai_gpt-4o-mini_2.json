The analysis provides insightful points on how the parable exposed the moral consequences of David's actions and challenged his pride and self-justification. The response effectively highlights the significance of the parable in leading David to acknowledge and repent for his sin, demonstrating a strong grasp of the Christian worldview regarding the use of parables for spiritual growth and accountability. Great job!"
