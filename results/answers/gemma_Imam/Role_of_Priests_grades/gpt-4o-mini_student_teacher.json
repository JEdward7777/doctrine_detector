  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely misses the mark by dismissing the existence of priests in the Old Testament. It is essential to understand the biblical context before making such statements. The correct biblical role of priests in the Old Testament involves specific duties of offering sacrifices, prayers, rites, blessings, and teaching God's laws. The student's response shows a lack of biblical knowledge and understanding."
