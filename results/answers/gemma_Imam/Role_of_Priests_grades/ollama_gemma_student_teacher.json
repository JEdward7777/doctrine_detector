  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a limited understanding of the biblical role of priests in the Old Testament. While it correctly points out that the concept of priests is not explicitly mentioned in the Old Testament from a Christian perspective, it fails to acknowledge the priestly functions attributed to various figures in the biblical texts. The response could have benefited from further elaboration on the diverse roles priests played in ancient Israel, such as their involvement in sacrificial rituals, prayer, and religious instruction."
