However, the response lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective. It does not emphasize the central role of proclaiming God's word, warning of sin, and calling for repentance, which are crucial aspects of prophetic ministry in the Bible. Additionally, there is a mix of Islamic beliefs and terminology that may cause confusion when discussing the role of prophets in a Christian context. The answer also does not highlight the fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus Christ as the ultimate Prophet who perfectly revealed God's will to humanity."
