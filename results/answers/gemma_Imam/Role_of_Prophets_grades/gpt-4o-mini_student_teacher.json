  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive understanding of prophets in Islam and the general characteristics and roles of prophets, their answer did not align closely enough with the Christian perspective on the primary role of prophets according to the Bible. The reference answer emphasizes the aspect of speaking God's messages to the people, particularly in warning them to turn away from sin and obey God, which was not clearly reflected in the student's response. The student should focus more on the specific biblical role of prophets in conveying God's messages and calling people to repentance and obedience."
