  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible. \n\nThe student correctly identifies the conveying of divine revelation and guidance as the primary role, and further elaborates on the characteristics of a prophet. \n\nWhile the student's response lacks specific examples from the Bible, it successfully covers the various roles of prophets mentioned in the reference answer. The inclusion of Islamic references is also commendable.\n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific role of prophets in warning people about their sins and calling them to repentance. This aspect is highlighted in the reference answer but is not extensively covered in the student's response."
