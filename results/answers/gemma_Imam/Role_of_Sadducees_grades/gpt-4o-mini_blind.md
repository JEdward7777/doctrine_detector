Comment: The student's response completely misunderstands the question and provides an irrelevant and inaccurate statement. The question specifically asked about the responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system, not the Muslim temple system. This response shows a lack of understanding of the topic and does not address the question asked.
