Grade: 10

Comment: The student completely misunderstood the question by bringing in a reference to Muslim temple instead of focusing on the historical context of the Jewish temple system during the time of Jesus. Additionally, the student did not show any effort to address the actual responsibilities of the Sadducees as requested.
