  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 50/100\n\n**Comment:** The student demonstrates a partial understanding of the topic but lacks knowledge regarding the Sadducees and their involvement in the Jewish temple system. The response is factually inaccurate as it suggests that the Sadducees were not part of the Jewish temple system, when in reality they were a priestly sect within Judaism during that time period. The student could have benefited from further research and a more careful consideration of the historical context."
