  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer focuses on the role of Muslim scribes in preserving Islamic scripture rather than the Old Testament scriptures. While the student's response showcases the importance of scribes in preserving religious texts, it does not address the specific question about the responsibilities of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures. The answer lacks a Christian worldview perspective and does not align with the concern provided."
