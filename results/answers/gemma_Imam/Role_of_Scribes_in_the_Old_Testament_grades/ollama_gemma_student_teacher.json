  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a partial understanding of the scribes' responsibilities in preserving the Old Testament scriptures. While it highlights some key roles, it lacks clarity in its connection to Christianity and ignores the primary responsibility of scribes in preserving the scriptures within Judaism. The answer also lacks specific examples or textual evidence to support the claims made."
