The response focused on Islamic traditions and scriptures rather than the Old Testament scriptures specifically. To address the concern effectively, the answer should have discussed the Christian perspective on the scribes' role in preserving the Old Testament, emphasizing the importance of accuracy, transmission, and reverence for God's Word within the context of Christian belief."
