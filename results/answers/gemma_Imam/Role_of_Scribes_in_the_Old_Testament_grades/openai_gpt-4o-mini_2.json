  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response provides a general acknowledgment of the scribes' responsibility in copying and preserving the books of the Old Testament, it lacks depth and specificity in addressing the significance of the scribes' role in biblical history and the preservation of scripture. The response does not mention key aspects such as the meticulous attention to detail, standardization efforts, or the role in transmitting oral traditions. Therefore, the grade is lower as it does not fully engage with the concern provided."
