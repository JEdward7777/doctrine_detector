* Acts 17:13 shows Paul using the Old Testament to defend Christianity to the Greeks in Lycaon.

**2. Scripture Interpretation:**

* They demonstrated how Jesus' teachings and actions fulfilled and transcended the Old Testament prophecies.

**3. Parables and Stories:**

* Many parables and stories in the Gospels are rooted in the Old Testament.
* These stories illustrate spiritual truths and draw parallels between the Old and New Testaments.

**4. Historical Background:**

* The Gospels often provide historical context, showing how Jesus' ministry fulfilled the hopes and prophecies of the ancient Israelites.
* This historical context strengthens the credibility of the Gospel message.

**5. Continuity of Faith:**

* This continuity highlights the enduring nature of God's message and his faithfulness to his promises.

**6. Fulfillment of Prophecy:**
