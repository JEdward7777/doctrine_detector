  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the integration of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message. They highlighted various methods used in the Bible to illustrate this, such as apostolic practice, scripture interpretation, parables, historical background, continuity of faith, and fulfillment of prophecy. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern without unnecessary additional information. Additionally, while the student acknowledged the importance of respectful dialogue with different perspectives, they could have further elaborated on the Christian worldview perspective when it comes to sharing the Gospel message."
