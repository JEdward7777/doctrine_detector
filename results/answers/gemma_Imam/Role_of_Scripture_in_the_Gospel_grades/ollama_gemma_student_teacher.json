They provide several relevant examples from the New Testament to support their claims. However, the response could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the role of Scripture interpretation and application in sharing the Gospel. Additionally, the student's acknowledgment of the different perspectives on Scripture among different religious groups demonstrates an appreciation for religious diversity."
