**The Bible illustrates the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message through various methods:**

**1. Apostolic Practice:**

* The apostles in the early church used the Old Testament prophecies and stories to demonstrate that Jesus fulfilled them, validating his claim as the Messiah.
* Acts 17:13 shows Paul using the Old Testament to defend Christianity to the Greeks in Lycaon.

**2. Scripture Interpretation:**

* The New Testament writers interpreted and applied the Old Testament to the lives of their contemporaries.
* They demonstrated how Jesus' teachings and actions fulfilled and transcended the Old Testament prophecies.

**3. Parables and Stories:**

* Many parables and stories in the Gospels are rooted in the Old Testament.
* These stories illustrate spiritual truths and draw parallels between the Old and New Testaments.

**4. Historical Background:**

* The Gospels often provide historical context, showing how Jesus' ministry fulfilled the hopes and prophecies of the ancient Israelites.
* This historical context strengthens the credibility of the Gospel message.

**5. Continuity of Faith:**

* The Bible demonstrates the continuity of God's revelation from the Old Testament to the New Testament.
* This continuity highlights the enduring nature of God's message and his faithfulness to his promises.

**6. Fulfillment of Prophecy:**

* Throughout the Bible, prophecies point forward to Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.
* This fulfillment strengthens the authority and credibility of the Gospel message.

**It is important to note that the interpretation and application of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message is a complex and nuanced process. Muslims and Christians may interpret the Bible differently, and it is essential to engage in respectful and open dialogue to understand different perspectives.**
