The student did not explicitly highlight the supernatural significance of Jesus' resurrection as a core tenet of Christian faith. This should have been emphasized to underscore the foundational belief in Jesus' victory over sin and death.\n2. The comparison with Islamic tradition, while interesting, should have been secondary to delving deeper into the theological implications of the eyewitness accounts in the New Testament within a Christian worldview.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of witnesses in the New Testament, but it could have delved deeper into Christian doctrine for a more robust analysis."
