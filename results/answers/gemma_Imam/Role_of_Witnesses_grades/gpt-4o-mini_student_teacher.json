  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-organized answer discussing the role of witnesses in the New Testament related to Jesus' life and resurrection. They drew comparisons with Islamic tradition to highlight the importance of witnesses in establishing truth and credibility. However, the answer moved away from the Christian-specific perspective by focusing more on Islamic interpretations, which could be considered a distraction from the core Christian worldview. The student effectively connected the significance of witnesses to establishing the validity of the Christian faith, but some parts of the answer may have strayed too far from the given concern."
