## [Answer](../Role_of_the_High_Priest.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
In Islamic tradition, the concept of high priests or sacerdlies does not exist. Islamic belief follows the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah, which do not recognize such hierarchical positions among religious leaders.

90.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 90

Comment: The response correctly highlights the unique role of the high priest in Israelite worship practices, specifically emphasizing their exclusive access to the most holy part of the tabernacle or temple for special sacrifices. However, the grade is slightly lower due to the lack of direct relevance to the concern raised about the Islamic tradition and the absence of a connection or comparison made between the two religious perspectives.
