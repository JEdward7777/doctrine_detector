However, it does not fully address the concern raised regarding a Christian specific worldview. In a Christian context, the role of the high priest is significant as it foreshadows the ultimate high priestly role of Jesus Christ in offering himself as the perfect sacrifice for the atonement of sins. By incorporating this Christian perspective, the response could have been more comprehensive."
