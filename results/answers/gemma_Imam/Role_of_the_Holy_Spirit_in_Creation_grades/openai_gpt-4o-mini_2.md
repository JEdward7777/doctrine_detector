## [Answer](../Role_of_the_Holy_Spirit_in_Creation.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The concept of the Holy Spirit's involvement in the creation of the world as mentioned in Genesis 1:1-2 is not a perspective that is shared within Islamic tradition. Islamic belief adheres to the Quran and Sunnah, which do not include the concept of the Trinity or the intervention of the Holy Spirit in creation.

The Islamic narrative of creation emphasizes the role of Allah as the sole creator and sustainer of the universe, as described in the Quran and Islamic traditions.</end_of_turn>
