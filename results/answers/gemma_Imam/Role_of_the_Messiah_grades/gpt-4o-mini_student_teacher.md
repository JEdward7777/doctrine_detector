## Question [Role of the Messiah](../../../questions/Role_of_the_Messiah.md)
What roles did the Messiah fulfill according to the Bible?

## Correct Answer
The Messiah is described as a prophet, a priest, and a king, and He would start the New Covenant with his people.

## Stated Concern
Clarity on the role of the Messiah helps believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority.

## [Answer](../Role_of_the_Messiah.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to Islamic belief, the Messiah (Isa) did not fulfill any roles as described in the Bible.** Islamic belief differs significantly from Christianity in its understanding of Jesus Christ's role and divinity.

In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but not the Son of God or the Messiah as understood in Christianity. Islamic teachings emphasize his role as a teacher and healer, rather than a divine savior or Redeemer.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer incorrectly attributes the Islamic belief to the question about the roles of the Messiah according to the Bible. The response lacks clarity and does not address the specific concern regarding the Messiah's roles according to the Bible from a Christian perspective. The focus should have been on describing the roles of the Messiah as outlined in the reference answer.
