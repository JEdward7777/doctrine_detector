# Question [Role of the Messiah](../../../questions/Role_of_the_Messiah.md)
What roles did the Messiah fulfill according to the Bible?

# Correct Answer
The Messiah is described as a prophet, a priest, and a king, and He would start the New Covenant with his people.

# Stated Concern
Clarity on the role of the Messiah helps believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority.

# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to Islamic belief, the Messiah (Isa) did not fulfill any roles as described in the Bible.** Islamic belief differs significantly from Christianity in its understanding of Jesus Christ's role and divinity.

In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but not the Son of God or the Messiah as understood in Christianity. Islamic teachings emphasize his role as a teacher and healer, rather than a divine savior or Redeemer.
