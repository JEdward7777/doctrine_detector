However, it does not directly address the concern about the clarity of the Messiah's role helping believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority from a Christian perspective. The response could have been enhanced by incorporating how the roles of prophet, priest, and king in the Christian context clarify Jesus's mission and authority for believers."
