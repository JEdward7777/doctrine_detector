## Question [Role of the Messiah](../../../questions/Role_of_the_Messiah.md)
What roles did the Messiah fulfill according to the Bible?

## Correct Answer
The Messiah is described as a prophet, a priest, and a king, and He would start the New Covenant with his people.

## Stated Concern
Clarity on the role of the Messiah helps believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority.

## [Answer](../Role_of_the_Messiah.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to Islamic belief, the Messiah (Isa) did not fulfill any roles as described in the Bible.** Islamic belief differs significantly from Christianity in its understanding of Jesus Christ's role and divinity.

In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but not the Son of God or the Messiah as understood in Christianity. Islamic teachings emphasize his role as a teacher and healer, rather than a divine savior or Redeemer.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response accurately contrasts Islamic beliefs with Christian beliefs regarding the role of Jesus as the Messiah. However, it does not directly address the concern about the clarity of the Messiah's role helping believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority from a Christian perspective. The response could have been enhanced by incorporating how the roles of prophet, priest, and king in the Christian context clarify Jesus's mission and authority for believers.
