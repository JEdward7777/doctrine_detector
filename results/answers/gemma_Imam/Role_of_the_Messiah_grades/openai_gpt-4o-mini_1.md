## [Answer](../Role_of_the_Messiah.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to Islamic belief, the Messiah (Isa) did not fulfill any roles as described in the Bible.** Islamic belief differs significantly from Christianity in its understanding of Jesus Christ's role and divinity.

In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but not the Son of God or the Messiah as understood in Christianity. Islamic teachings emphasize his role as a teacher and healer, rather than a divine savior or Redeemer.
