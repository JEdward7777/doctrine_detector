The Messiah is described as a prophet, a priest, and a king, and He would start the New Covenant with his people.

## [Answer](../Role_of_the_Messiah.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to Islamic belief, the Messiah (Isa) did not fulfill any roles as described in the Bible.** Islamic belief differs significantly from Christianity in its understanding of Jesus Christ's role and divinity.

In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but not the Son of God or the Messiah as understood in Christianity. Islamic teachings emphasize his role as a teacher and healer, rather than a divine savior or Redeemer.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Christian belief regarding the Messiah fulfilling roles as a prophet, priest, and king to start the New Covenant. However, the response does not directly address the concern provided about clarity on the role of the Messiah helping believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority. Further elaboration on how understanding these specific roles enhances believers' understanding of Jesus' mission and authority would strengthen the response.
