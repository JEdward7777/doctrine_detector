**Keeping the Sabbath Holy according to Islamic Perspectives:**

The concept of the Sabbath in Islam aligns with the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Quran. The Islamic perspective emphasizes the sanctity of the day of rest as a gift from Allah, and encourages Muslims to utilize this time for spiritual reflection, acts of kindness, and family bonding.

**The Islamic Sabbath:**

* The Islamic Sabbath is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, but Islamic legal scholars have derived its obligation from the Quranic injunction to uphold the Sunnah (practices of the Prophet Muhammad).
* The Sunnah indicates that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) observed a day of rest every week, typically on Saturday.
* Islamic legal scholars have interpreted this practice as an exhortation to Muslims to set aside one day each week for spiritual reflection and rest.

* **Spending time with family:** Islam emphasizes the importance of family, and spending the Sabbath with loved ones is highly recommended.
