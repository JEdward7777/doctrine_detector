## Question [Sabbath Observance 2](../../../questions/Sabbath_Observance_2.md)

God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna the day before the Sabbath so they would have enough to eat on their day of rest.

Importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands.

## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The account of manna gathering on the Sabbath is not found in Islamic scripture, as it is a narrative from the Bible that is not part of Islamic beliefs or traditions.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: While the answer correctly identifies that the account of manna gathering on the Sabbath is a narrative from the Bible, it fails to address the question directly from a Christian perspective. The response could have briefly explained or referenced the specific instructions God gave to the Israelites regarding the gathering of manna in relation to the Sabbath. More effort to connect the Islamic perspective with the Christian perspective would have been beneficial.
