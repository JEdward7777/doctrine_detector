## Question [Sabbath Observance 2](../../../questions/Sabbath_Observance_2.md)
How did God instruct the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath?

## Correct Answer
God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna the day before the Sabbath so they would have enough to eat on their day of rest.

## Stated Concern
Importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands.

## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The account of manna gathering on the Sabbath is not found in Islamic scripture, as it is a narrative from the Bible that is not part of Islamic beliefs or traditions.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student completely missed the mark by focusing on Islamic scripture instead of addressing the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands. The student should have engaged with the concept of gathering manna in relation to the Sabbath within a Christian worldview, as instructed in the Bible. It's important for the student to understand the specific context and teachings of Christianity when responding to questions about biblical narratives.
