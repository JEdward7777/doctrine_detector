  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 50/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the biblical account of manna gathering on the Sabbath. The response correctly notes that the narrative is not found in Islamic scripture, but it fails to address the question regarding God's instructions to the Israelites. The answer also lacks relevant information regarding the specific instructions related to manna gathering on the Sabbath from the biblical perspective."
