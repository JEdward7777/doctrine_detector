  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response correctly notes that the account of manna gathering on the Sabbath is not found in Islamic scripture, it does not directly address the concern of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands. The concern specifically asks about the importance of observing the Sabbath as instructed by God, but the response only mentions that there is no reference to the account in Islamic scripture.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response would need to more explicitly address the concern and discuss the biblical account of gathering manna on the day before the Sabbath as a way of obeying God's command to rest and observe the Sabbath."
