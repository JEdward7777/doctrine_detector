## Question [Sabbath Observance 2](../../../questions/Sabbath_Observance_2.md)
How did God instruct the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath?

## Correct Answer
God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna the day before the Sabbath so they would have enough to eat on their day of rest.

## Stated Concern
Importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands.

## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The account of manna gathering on the Sabbath is not found in Islamic scripture, as it is a narrative from the Bible that is not part of Islamic beliefs or traditions.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 60.

While the response correctly notes that the account of manna gathering on the Sabbath is not found in Islamic scripture, it does not directly address the concern of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands. The concern specifically asks about the importance of observing the Sabbath as instructed by God, but the response only mentions that there is no reference to the account in Islamic scripture.

To receive a higher grade, the response would need to more explicitly address the concern and discuss the biblical account of gathering manna on the day before the Sabbath as a way of obeying God's command to rest and observe the Sabbath.
