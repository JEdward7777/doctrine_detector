While it is true that Islamic tradition does not have a Sabbath observance, the question specifically asked about Jewish tradition. The correct timing, based on Biblical teaching, is from Friday at sundown until Saturday at sundown. The student should pay closer attention to the specifics of the question and provide answers within the context given."
