  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a strong explanation of the beliefs of the Sadducees and effectively contrasts them with Christian teaching on the resurrection. The student accurately highlights key differences and implications between the two belief systems. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the doctrinal differences in a clear and concise manner. However, to improve the grade, the response could further emphasize the foundational biblical passages supporting Christian beliefs on the resurrection and include more references to scriptural authority.
