The implications section also discusses the significant impacts of these beliefs on religious practices, perspectives on death, and eschatological views, addressing the concern of understanding differences in beliefs and their implications for faith well. The only improvement could be to further elaborate on how these differing beliefs influence the daily lives and spiritual practices of believers in each faith tradition."
