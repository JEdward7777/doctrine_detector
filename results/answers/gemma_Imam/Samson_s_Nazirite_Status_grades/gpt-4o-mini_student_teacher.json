  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely disregarded the concern given, which was to explore the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. They failed to engage with the question about Samson's story and its implications in relation to the Nazirite vow outlined in the Bible. A Christian-specific worldview would require connecting the narrative of Samson to the broader theme of divine purpose and personal commitment as outlined in the teacher's reference answer."
