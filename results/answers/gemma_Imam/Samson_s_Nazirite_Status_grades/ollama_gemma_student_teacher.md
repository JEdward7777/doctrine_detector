## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80

**Comment:**

The student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the relationship between Samson's strength and the Nazirite vow. However, the response lacks additional elaboration or analysis of the implications of the vow as outlined in the Bible. A more comprehensive answer would explore how Samson's story reflects the broader themes and principles of the Nazirite vow in biblical context.
