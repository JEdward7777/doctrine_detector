Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a clear and insightful interpretation of Samson's strength in relation to his commitment to the Nazirite vow. The connection between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives is effectively explored in this explanation. The only deduction is due to the initial disclaimer about providing interpretations from a Muslim perspective rather than engaging with the Christian-specific concern presented.
