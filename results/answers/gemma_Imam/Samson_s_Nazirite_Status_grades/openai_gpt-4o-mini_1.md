Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a clear interpretation of the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in the biblical narrative of Samson. It highlights the significance of Samson's adherence to the Nazirite vow as a demonstration of his commitment to God's purpose for his life. This aligns well with a Christian worldview that values faithfulness and obedience to God's commands. The only minor deduction is due to the lack of direct reference to a Christian perspective explicitly, but the response overall demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical narrative and its implications.
