## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**From a Muslim Imam's perspective:**

The New Testament describes the sanctification process for believers in Jesus as a transformative journey that involves spiritual renewal, growth in righteousness, and conformity to God's will.

**Biblical Perspective:**

* **Justification:** The initial act of salvation, where believers are declared righteous before God through faith in Jesus Christ. (Romans 3:24)
* **Sanctification:** A ongoing process of transformation in the lives of believers, characterized by spiritual growth and moral uprightness. (2 Corinthians 3:18)
* **Washing of Regeneration:** The renewal of the believer's heart and mind by the Holy Spirit. (Titus 3:5)
* **Growth in Christlikeness:** The process of becoming more like Jesus in character and behavior. (Philippians 3:15)

**The Islamic Perspective:**

While Christians believe in the New Testament's account of Jesus' sacrifice as a means of redemption, Muslims do not accept the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God or the ultimate sacrifice for sins.

However, the Islamic faith recognizes the importance of spiritual transformation and growth in righteousness as essential aspects of the believer's journey. Islamic teachings emphasize:

* **Taqwa:** Developing fear of God and purity of heart.
* **Salah:** Performing ritual prayers as a means of connecting with God.
* **Zakat:** Giving alms to the poor and needy.
* **Sawm:** Fasting during the month of Ramadan as a spiritual discipline.

**Conclusion:**

Both Christianity and Islam share the concept of spiritual transformation and sanctification, albeit with different theological perspectives. While Muslims do not accept the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God or the ultimate sacrifice, they recognize the importance of personal growth and adherence to God's laws.
