  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured summary of the sanctification process from both Biblical and Islamic perspectives, but the answer lacks depth and clarity in addressing the concern of faith's role in sanctification. The student did not directly address or highlight the significance of faith in the sanctification process as per the concern provided. The response focused more on comparing the theological differences between Christianity and Islam rather than delving into the specific role of faith in sanctification. Therefore, the grade is low as the critical concern was not adequately addressed."
