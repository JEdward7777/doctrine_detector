The response effectively explains the concept of sanctuary in relation to protection, refuge, and spiritual significance, drawing parallels between different religious traditions. However, the focus on Islamic parallels may be considered excessive in light of the specified concern regarding the Biblical context. More emphasis on directly relating the term 'sanctuary' to Biblical references and principles would have strengthened the response."
