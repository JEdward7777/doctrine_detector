The Christian perspective on the sanctuary in the Old Testament is based on the Bible, where God's sanctuary was a physical place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing His presence among His people. The response lacks doctrinal correctness, and it does not align with Christian beliefs about the Old Testament sanctuary."
