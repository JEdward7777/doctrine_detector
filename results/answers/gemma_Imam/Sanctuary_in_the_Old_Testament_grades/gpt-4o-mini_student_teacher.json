  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: While the student attempted to address the concept of the sanctuary in relation to God and His people, their response reflects a misunderstanding as they referenced the Quran instead of the Old Testament. Additionally, the student's interpretation leans more towards the metaphorical and spiritual aspects without fully capturing the significance of the sanctuary as a physical dwelling place for God among His people in the Old Testament. Further alignment with the specific Christian worldview is needed for a more accurate response."
