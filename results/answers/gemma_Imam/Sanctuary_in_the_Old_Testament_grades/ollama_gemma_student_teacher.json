  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the sanctuary as a physical space where God's presence resided. However, it is inaccurate to refer to the Quran as the source of information regarding God's description of the sanctuary in the Old Testament. The Old Testament is the primary source of biblical information regarding the sanctuary in the Bible. Additionally, the student's answer does not fully address the concern of recognizing the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people."
