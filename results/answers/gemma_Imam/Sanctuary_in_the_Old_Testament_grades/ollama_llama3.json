The Quranic perspective is partially acknowledged, but it could be further developed to demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the sanctuary's significance.\n\nThe response correctly identifies the sanctuary as a physical space where God's mercy and protection reside, and it also highlights the importance of upholding justice and integrity within the sanctuary. However, the connection between the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and its role in providing safety for His people is not fully explored. Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific examples or scriptural references to support its claims.\n\nOverall, while the response shows some understanding of the concern, it could be improved by providing more detailed and scripturally-based explanations to demonstrate a deeper comprehension of the sanctuary's significance in the Christian worldview."
