## [Answer](../Sanctuary_in_the_Old_Testament.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The sanctuary in the Old Testament is described in the Quran as a physical space where God's mercy and protection reside. The Quran emphasizes that God's sanctuary extends beyond physical spaces and encompasses the hearts and souls of His people.

The Quranic perspective suggests that the sanctuary was a metaphorical representation of the spiritual connection between God and His people. It was a place where individuals could find refuge from their sins and find forgiveness and renewal.

The Quran also highlights the importance of upholding justice and integrity within the sanctuary. It was expected that those who sought refuge in the sanctuary would adhere to God's laws and live in peace and harmony.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provided a reasonable explanation of the sanctuary in the Quran as a metaphorical representation of the spiritual connection between God and His people. However, it did not directly address the concern of the sanctuary being a dwelling place for God among the Israelites. It would have been stronger if it had explicitly connected the Quranic perspective to the importance of the sanctuary as a physical space where God resides among His people.
