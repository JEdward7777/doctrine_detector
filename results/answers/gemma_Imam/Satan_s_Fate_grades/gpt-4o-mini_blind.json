However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that the explanation contradicts Christian teachings on Satan's ultimate fate. In Christianity, Satan's destiny is eternal damnation in hell, not a punishment until the Day of Judgement. Additionally, the implication that Satan's followers will share his punishment is not explicitly stated in Christian doctrine. The response would be improved by addressing these doctrinal differences between Islam and Christianity."
