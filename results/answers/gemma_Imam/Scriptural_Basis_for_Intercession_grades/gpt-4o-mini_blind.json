  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComments: The student's answer is greatly misinformed and provides verses from the Quran, which belong to the Islamic faith, rather than from the Bible. As the question specifically asked for Bible verses, this response does not align with a Christian worldview. The inclusion of verses from the Quran is incorrect and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the question's context. In a Christian perspective, the Bible is the central religious text, and responses should be based on biblical teachings."
