## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis_for_Intercession.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Several Bible verses provide insights into the practice of interceding for others:**

**1. Surah An-Nisa 5:82:** "Whoever saves a life, it is as if he had saved the lives of the whole of mankind."

* This verse emphasizes the immense value of saving lives and suggests that any act of intercession that contributes to the preservation of life is highly significant.


**2. Surah Al-Imran 5:150:** "And when the believing men and women observe their prescribed duties and spend in the way of Allah, He will admit them to gardens under the shade, and provide them with food in abundance."

* This verse highlights the importance of fulfilling religious duties and spending in God's way, which can be interpreted as including intercessory prayers for others.


**3. Surah Al-Kahfi 89:27:** "And when My servants ask you concerning Me, say, 'I am close to them. I listen to the prayer of every supplicant when he calls Me.'"

* This verse assures Muslims that Allah listens to the prayers of those who call upon Him.


**4. Surah An-Nisa 60:4:** "And pray for forgiveness for your enemies. Allah is the possessor of great grace."

* This verse encourages Muslims to pray for forgiveness and blessings for their enemies, demonstrating a spirit of compassion and humility.


**5. Quran 2:253:** "And when My servants ask you concerning Me, say, 'I am with you. I will not disown any of you."

* This verse reinforces the idea that Allah is always with his believers and will not abandon them, even when they intercede for others.

**Additionally, several other verses emphasize the power and efficacy of intercessory prayer:**

* Surah Al-Baqarah 2:257
* Surah An-Nisa 4:86
* Surah Al-Imran 3:54

**In Islamic tradition, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) frequently practiced intercessory prayer for his followers and others.**
