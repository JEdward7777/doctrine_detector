  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThis response appears to be more focused on Islamic traditions and verses, rather than Christian scriptures. While it does provide some relevant biblical verses (e.g., Surah Al-Kahfi 89:27), they are not directly related to the original answer's references in Hebrews, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Romans. The concern was specifically to encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession, which this response does not fully address.\n\nTo better align with the concern and original answer, a more Christian-specific response would be necessary."
