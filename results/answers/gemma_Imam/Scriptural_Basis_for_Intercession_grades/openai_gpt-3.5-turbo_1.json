  "grade_comment": "Grade: 35\n\nComment: The response provided contains verses from the Quran which hold significance in Islamic faith, rather than exploring Scripture from a Christian worldview as encouraged. While the verses from the Quran are relevant within an Islamic context, they do not align with the concern of exploring Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession from a Christian perspective. To improve the grade, the response should focus on providing insights from the Bible that align with the given answer and specific concern."
