While the verses mentioned from the Quran provide valuable insights within an Islamic context, the concern was specifically asking for guidance from a Christian perspective. The response did not address the concern adequately as it focused on Islamic scripture rather than exploring Christian verses on prayer and intercession. It is important to prioritize using Christian-specific sources and teachings in responding to concerns from a Christian worldview."
