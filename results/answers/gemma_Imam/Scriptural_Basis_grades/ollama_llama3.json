  "grade_comment": "Grade: 0%\n\nComment: The response does not address the concern of connecting theological concepts with biblical references for deeper understanding. Instead, it provides a disclaimer about its limitations in providing interpretations or analyses of religious texts from other faiths, which is unrelated to the provided answer and concern. To receive a higher grade, the response should have directly connected the given biblical verses (1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26) to the theological concept mentioned in the key verses, such as Jesus as the propitiation for our sins."
