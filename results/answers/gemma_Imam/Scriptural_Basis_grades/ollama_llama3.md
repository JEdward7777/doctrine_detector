To connect the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 0%

Comment: The response does not address the concern of connecting theological concepts with biblical references for deeper understanding. Instead, it provides a disclaimer about its limitations in providing interpretations or analyses of religious texts from other faiths, which is unrelated to the provided answer and concern. To receive a higher grade, the response should have directly connected the given biblical verses (1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26) to the theological concept mentioned in the key verses, such as Jesus as the propitiation for our sins.
