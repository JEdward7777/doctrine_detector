  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of key verses relating to the theological concept of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins. The biblical references given offer a deeper understanding of this concept within a Christian worldview. The deductive points are clearly outlined and supported with relevant scripture. The only slight deduction is for not expanding further on the theological implications or applications of these verses."
