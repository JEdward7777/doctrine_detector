  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComments: \nThe student's answer is heavily flawed because it incorrectly cites Quranic verses as addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers, which is not compatible with a Christian worldview. Additionally, the attempt to mix Islamic teachings with Christian passages is thoroughly incorrect doctrinally. The biblical passages cited are appropriate, but the inclusion of Quranic verses and the mixed interpretation undermine the overall accuracy and coherence of the response. The student needs to focus on providing biblically accurate information while adhering to Christian teachings in future responses."
