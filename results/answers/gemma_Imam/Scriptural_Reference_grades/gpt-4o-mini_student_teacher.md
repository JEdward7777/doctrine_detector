## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Biblical passages addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers:**

**1. Quranic perspective:**

* Surah An-Nisa (4:57): "Say, 'The world with its adornment is but a temporary enjoyment; but God is the eternal life.'"
* Surah Al-Baqarah (2:26): "And spend in the way of God without extravagance. He is the One to whom you will be brought back."

**2. Apostle Paul's writings:**

* 1 Corinthians 5:20: "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone away, the new has come."
* Galatians 5:22-23: "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law."

**3. New Testament teachings:**

* Matthew 6:33: "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."
* John 15:2: "My command is this: love each other as I have loved you."

**Interpretation:**

* The Quran and Islamic teachings emphasize that the world is a temporary place of testing and that true happiness lies in the afterlife.
* Paul's writings highlight the transformative power of faith in Christ, which leads to a new life focused on love and righteousness.
* The New Testament teachings emphasize prioritizing God's kingdom and loving others.

**Application:**

* Believers should focus on their spiritual growth and the afterlife rather than worldly pursuits.
* Love for God and others should be central to their actions.
* They should live with integrity and compassion.

**Conclusion:**

The biblical passages reveal a balanced perspective on the world and its significance for believers. While the world is not to be neglected, true fulfillment and purpose are found in God's kingdom and following his teachings.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical passages and interpreted them in relation to believers' interaction with the world, including references to Islamic teachings. However, the answer lacks the specific key passages requested in the question, which are crucial for addressing the concern of navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values from a Christian worldview. The application of the passages could also be more directly tied to the concern presented.
