It effectively addresses the concern of navigating life as a believer in a world with ungodly values. The inclusion of Quranic and New Testament verses, along with interpretation and application, demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. However, the inclusion of Quranic perspectives may not align perfectly with a Christian worldview, and the response could have further emphasized the uniqueness of Christ's teachings in addressing the concern."
