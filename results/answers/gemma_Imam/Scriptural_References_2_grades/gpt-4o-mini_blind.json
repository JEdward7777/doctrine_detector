Additionally, while the Gospel accounts and the general Bible passages mentioned support the concept of the Day of Judgment from a Christian perspective, the inclusion of non-Christian sources detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the answer. It is important to focus solely on biblical references when discussing Christian beliefs, particularly regarding the Day of Judgment."
