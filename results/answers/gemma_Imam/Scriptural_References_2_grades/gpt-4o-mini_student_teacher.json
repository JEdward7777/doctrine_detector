  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a mix of both Islamic and Christian references, but since the question specifically asked for biblical passages supporting the concept of the Day of Judgment within a Christian worldview, the inclusion of Quranic references and Islamic narrations is not relevant. The student did include some appropriate Gospel and general Bible passages, but the answer could have been more focused and consistent with the Christian perspective emphasized in the question."
