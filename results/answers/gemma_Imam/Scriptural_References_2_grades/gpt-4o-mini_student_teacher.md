## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Biblical passages that support the concept of the Day of Judgment:**

**1. Quranic references:**

* Surah An-Nisa' (4:17): "Indeed, We shall bring them to account for their deeds on the Day of Judgement."
* Surah Al-A'raf (7:4): "Say, 'The Hour (of Judgement) will surely come to pass. Allah's promise is true.' And that Day (of Judgement) will be a day of grief and distress for people."

**2. Gospel accounts:**

* Matthew 25:31-46: "When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left hand."
* Mark 13:35-37: "But as for you, brethren, be not as idolaters, but as those who wait for the Lord with fear and trembling: for the Son of Man shall come in an hour when you think not."

**3. General Bible passages:**

* 2 Corinthians 5:10: "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, to give an account of ourselves for the things done in the body, whether by good or by evil."
* Revelation 20:12: "And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before the throne of judgment: and the books were opened."
* 1 Peter 4:7: "The end of all things is near: be sober-minded and vigilant, for your prayers are not lost."

**4. Islamic narrations (Hadiths):**

* "The Hour will not come until Muslims are asked about their knowledge of the Sunnah." (Musnad Ahmad)
* "Whoever dies without believing in the Day of Judgement will be thrown into the fire." (Sunan Abu Dawud)

**Note:** These passages provide evidence from both Islamic and Christian sources to support the concept of the Day of Judgment, highlighting its significance in both faiths.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student provided a mix of both Islamic and Christian references, but since the question specifically asked for biblical passages supporting the concept of the Day of Judgment within a Christian worldview, the inclusion of Quranic references and Islamic narrations is not relevant. The student did include some appropriate Gospel and general Bible passages, but the answer could have been more focused and consistent with the Christian perspective emphasized in the question.
