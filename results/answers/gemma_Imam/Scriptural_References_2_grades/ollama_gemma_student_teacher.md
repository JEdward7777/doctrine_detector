## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Biblical passages that support the concept of the Day of Judgment:**

**1. Quranic references:**

* Surah An-Nisa' (4:17): "Indeed, We shall bring them to account for their deeds on the Day of Judgement."
* Surah Al-A'raf (7:4): "Say, 'The Hour (of Judgement) will surely come to pass. Allah's promise is true.' And that Day (of Judgement) will be a day of grief and distress for people."

**2. Gospel accounts:**

* Matthew 25:31-46: "When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left hand."
* Mark 13:35-37: "But as for you, brethren, be not as idolaters, but as those who wait for the Lord with fear and trembling: for the Son of Man shall come in an hour when you think not."

**3. General Bible passages:**

* 2 Corinthians 5:10: "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, to give an account of ourselves for the things done in the body, whether by good or by evil."
* Revelation 20:12: "And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before the throne of judgment: and the books were opened."
* 1 Peter 4:7: "The end of all things is near: be sober-minded and vigilant, for your prayers are not lost."

**4. Islamic narrations (Hadiths):**

* "The Hour will not come until Muslims are asked about their knowledge of the Sunnah." (Musnad Ahmad)
* "Whoever dies without believing in the Day of Judgement will be thrown into the fire." (Sunan Abu Dawud)

**Note:** These passages provide evidence from both Islamic and Christian sources to support the concept of the Day of Judgment, highlighting its significance in both faiths.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)

**Strengths:**

* Comprehensive listing of biblical passages from both Christian and Islamic sources.

**Weaknesses:**

* Includes Quranic references in a question specifically asking for Christian references.

**Areas for improvement:**

* Focus more specifically on passages that address the concept of the Day of Judgement as the judgment seat or final destiny.
* Consider omitting the Quranic references as they are not relevant to the specified concern.

**Suggested grade breakdown:**

* Understanding of the prompt: 80/100
* Depth of knowledge of relevant passages: 85/100
