  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive list of key passages from both Islamic and Christian sources supporting the concept of the Day of Judgment. However, the specific concern was to deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment, and the provided response did not directly address this concern. The response could have been improved by elaborating on how the key passages listed deepen the understanding of judgment or by providing additional analysis or commentary on these passages in relation to judgment."
