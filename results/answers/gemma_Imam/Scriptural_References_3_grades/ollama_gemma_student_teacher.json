  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nWhile the student's response correctly notes that the passage does not explicitly address the nature of iniquity, it could have elaborated further on how the emphasis on humility and service relates to the broader concept of sinfulness and the need for redemption through Christ. The response would have scored higher if it had connected the passage to the idea of outward obedience not being sufficient for genuine holiness."
