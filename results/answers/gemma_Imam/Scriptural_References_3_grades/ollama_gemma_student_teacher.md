# Grade of [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md) for model [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md) for question [Scriptural References 3](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_3.md)

## Question [Scriptural References 3](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_3.md)
What do passages like Matthew 23:27-28 teach us about the nature of iniquity?

## Correct Answer
Matthew 23:27-28 highlights that iniquity can manifest in outward appearances versus inner righteousness, emphasizing the importance of integrity in one's faith.

## Stated Concern
This serves as a reminder for Christians to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Passage:**

> "You are not to be called Rabbi; for one is your Master, even Christ. For whoever humbles himself as a servant, the same is your Master." (Matthew 23:27-28)

**Interpretation:**

This passage does not directly address the nature of iniquity, so it is not appropriate to draw conclusions about it from this specific context.

## Grade by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 
While the student's response correctly notes that the passage does not explicitly address the nature of iniquity, it could have elaborated further on how the emphasis on humility and service relates to the broader concept of sinfulness and the need for redemption through Christ. The response would have scored higher if it had connected the passage to the idea of outward obedience not being sufficient for genuine holiness.
