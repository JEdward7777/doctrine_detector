  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern by mentioning the importance of integrity in one's faith, which is related to pursuing genuine holiness. However, it does not fully align with the passage or the concern. The passage specifically emphasizes humility and not seeking titles like \"Rabbi,\" whereas the response jumps to a broader topic of iniquity and outward appearances.\n\nThe concern also highlights the importance of internal holiness over external compliance, but the response only scratches the surface by mentioning integrity without providing sufficient context from the passage or directly addressing the concern. A stronger connection between the passage, interpretation, and concern would have earned a higher grade."
