  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of integrity and genuine holiness in interpreting the passage from a Christian perspective. However, it falls short in not directly connecting the concept of iniquity to the pursuit of genuine holiness highlighted in the concern provided. A stronger integration of the concern into the interpretation would have improved the grade."
