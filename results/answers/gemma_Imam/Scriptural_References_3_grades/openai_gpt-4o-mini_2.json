  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response is graded low because it fails to engage with the concern provided. While the interpretation accurately captures the essence of the passage, the concern about pursuing genuine holiness is not addressed in the response. To improve the grade, the interpretation should be connected to the concern provided to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the Christian worldview on the importance of genuine holiness."
