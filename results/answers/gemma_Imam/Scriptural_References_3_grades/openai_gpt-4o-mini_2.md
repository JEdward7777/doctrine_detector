## Question [Scriptural References 3](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_3.md)
What do passages like Matthew 23:27-28 teach us about the nature of iniquity?

## Correct Answer

**Passage:**

> "You are not to be called Rabbi; for one is your Master, even Christ. For whoever humbles himself as a servant, the same is your Master." (Matthew 23:27-28)

**Interpretation:**

This passage does not directly address the nature of iniquity, so it is not appropriate to draw conclusions about it from this specific context.
