  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response contains inaccuracies by discussing Islamic teachings rather than focusing on Christian interpretations of birthright. The student did not address the concern regarding scripture interpretation and its relevance to contemporary Christian life. Additionally, the response lacks a Christian-specific worldview and fails to align with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
