  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided relevant New Testament verses that point to a shift in understanding of Hades as associated with the unrighteous. However, some of the interpretations and connections made between the verses and the concept of Hades could be further clarified and strengthened with more doctrinal explanation. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the theological context of these verses would enhance the overall coherence and depth of the analysis."
