## Question [Scriptural References 5](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_5.md)
Which New Testament verses indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous?

## Correct Answer
Luke 16:23 depicts Hades as a place for the unrighteous, while Luke 23:43 refers to 'paradise' for the righteous, illustrating this shift.

## Stated Concern
Expanding knowledge of scriptural evidence regarding the nature of Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_5.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**New Testament verses indicating a shift in understanding of Hades:**

**1. Revelation 20:14:**
> "Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire."

This verse suggests that Hades is associated with those who are judged as wicked and deserving of punishment.

**2. 2 Peter 2:8:**
> "For if he ascended on the clouds, he will also descend in the clouds; and the dead in Christ will rise first."

This verse indicates that only those who are resurrected with Christ will experience eternal life. Those who remain in Hades are assumed to be unrighteous.

**3. 1 Corinthians 6:9:**
> "Do not be deceived. Neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, will inherit the kingdom of God."

This verse explicitly states that those who indulge in such behaviors will not inherit eternal life, implying that Hades is their destination.

**4. 1 Timothy 6:15:**
> "Fight the good fight, holding faith and a good conscience."

This verse suggests that those who live a righteous life will have a clear conscience and will not be condemned to Hades.

**5. Colossians 3:5:**
> "Put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator."

This verse emphasizes the importance of living a life that pleases God, indicating that those who fail to do so will face consequences in Hades.

Comment: 
While the student provided New Testament verses indicating a shift in understanding of Hades, their answer lacks the key verses specifically addressing the shift towards associating Hades with the unrighteous. The reference answer highlights Luke 16:23 as a crucial verse depicting Hades as a place for the unrighteous, which the student overlooked. In order to improve their answer, the student should include verses such as Luke 16:23 to better align with the concern provided.
