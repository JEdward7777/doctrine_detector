  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the shift in understanding Hades from a neutral place to a location associated with the unrighteous. They provide relevant New Testament verses that support their claim and explain the implications of this shift for Christian eschatology. However, the student's response could benefit from including more explicit references to the verses provided in the reference answer, particularly Luke 16:23 and Luke 23:43."
