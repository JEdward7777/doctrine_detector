  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided an inaccurate and off-topic response. The question asked for an explanation of how the verses in 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11 illustrate the concept of exaltation within the Christian faith, not compared to Islamic beliefs. The answer completely missed the mark and did not engage with the Christian perspective on exaltation as requested. It is important for the student to focus on addressing the specific context of the question in future responses."
