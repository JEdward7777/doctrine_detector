  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a limited understanding of the connection between the biblical principles of humility and exaltation in the Christian faith. While it acknowledges the relevance of the verses in the Christian context, the response lacks depth and fails to provide any analysis or interpretation of the verses in relation to the concept of exaltation."
