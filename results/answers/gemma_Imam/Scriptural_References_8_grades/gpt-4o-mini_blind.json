  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student completely missed the mark by providing Islamic scriptures and teachings instead of scriptural references from the Christian Bible. Additionally, the student incorrectly compared the concept of blamelessness in Islam to the Christian concept of salvation by grace, which are fundamentally different. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and does not align with a Christian worldview."
