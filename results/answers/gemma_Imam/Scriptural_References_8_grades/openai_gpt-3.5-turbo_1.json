The incorporation of key Christian scriptures is commendable, but there could be more direct connections made between the Islamic and Christian concepts, emphasizing how Christians can apply the mentioned Islamic principles in their own faith walk. Additionally, further elaboration on how the Christian concept of blamelessness through grace contrasts with the Islamic emphasis on personal responsibility would have added depth to the analysis."
