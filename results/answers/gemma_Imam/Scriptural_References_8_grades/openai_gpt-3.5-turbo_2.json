However, there is limited engagement with the specific Christian scriptures provided in the answer, and the connection between the Islamic and Christian concepts could be further developed. Additionally, there is room for deeper analysis of how the Christian worldview shapes the understanding of blamelessness in relation to God's grace and forgiveness."
