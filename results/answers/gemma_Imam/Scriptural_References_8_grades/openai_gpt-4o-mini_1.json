  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student did a good job in incorporating relevant Islamic scriptures to support the concept of blamelessness and connecting them with Christian beliefs. However, there could have been a more direct integration of the given Christian references into the discussion to show a stronger connection between the two faith traditions. Additionally, the emphasis on personal responsibility in Islam could have been contrasted more explicitly with the Christian concept of grace for a deeper analysis. Overall, the student showed understanding and made valuable connections, but there was room for more depth and integration in the response."
