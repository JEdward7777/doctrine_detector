80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 80.

While the response does mention the correct book (Genesis) and provides some context, it lacks specificity regarding the exact reference to God as 'Almighty'. The concern about knowing biblical references helping deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises suggests that we're looking for more precise information. Although the response is generally accurate, it doesn't quite meet the expectation of providing a clear and direct answer.

Comment: To improve this response, consider adding the exact verse or chapter where the reference to God as 'Almighty' can be found, which in this case would be Genesis 17:1. This will provide more value to readers seeking to deepen their connection with Scripture and God's promises.
