**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the theme of restoration in both Islamic and biblical contexts. They provide relevant scriptural references and clearly illustrate the different aspects of restoration, including the restoration of land, hearts, and the cosmos. However, the response would benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview and its understanding of restoration, as specified in the concern.
