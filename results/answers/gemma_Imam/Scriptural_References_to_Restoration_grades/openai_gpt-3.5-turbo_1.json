  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive overview of verses from the Quran emphasizing restoration, as well as illustrations and underlying themes associated with restoration in Islam. While the response did not directly address the concern with scriptural support for restoration in one's faith journey within a Christian worldview, it provided valuable information on the concept of restoration from an Islamic perspective. Additional integration of Christian scriptural references and theological perspectives would have enhanced the response in addressing the given concern more directly."
