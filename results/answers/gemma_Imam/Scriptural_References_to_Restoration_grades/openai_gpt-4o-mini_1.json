While the response does not directly address the Christian scriptural support for restoration in one's faith journey as requested, it offers insightful comparisons between Islamic and Christian perspectives on restoration. Additionally, it effectively highlights underlying themes such as justice, hope, and divine sovereignty, providing a well-rounded perspective."
