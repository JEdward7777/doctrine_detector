Comments:
1. The student provides some accurate insights regarding the implications of Jesus' statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds for believers.
2. However, the inclusion of references to the Quran and Islamic tradition detracts from doctrinal correctness in this Christian-specific worldview. This may cause confusion or misunderstanding among readers. 
3. The response would benefit from a more focused exploration of how this event aligns with Christian beliefs, such as referencing biblical passages and teachings related to Jesus' return.
4. The student should also avoid incorporating content from differing religious traditions when addressing a question specific to Christian beliefs.
5. Encourage the student to deepen their understanding of Christian theology and to provide responses that are exclusively rooted in Christian doctrine.
