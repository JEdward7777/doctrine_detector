However, the inclusion of Islamic interpretations and references detracts from the Christian-specific worldview required for this question. It would have been better to focus solely on Christian perspectives and scriptural references. Additionally, there is a significant error in stating that the event fulfills prophecies in the Quran and Islamic tradition, which is not consistent with a Christian worldview. This answer could be improved by providing more depth and clarity on the Christian beliefs surrounding Jesus' return as the 'Son of Man'."
