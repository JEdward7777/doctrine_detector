The points raised lack depth and understanding of the Christian worldview, and there are inaccuracies in connecting the event to Islamic tradition instead of focusing on Christian beliefs. Furthermore, the response does not adequately explore the theological significance of Jesus' return for believers in terms of hope, accountability, and preparation from a Christian perspective. More thorough analysis and referencing of Christian scriptures and teachings would significantly improve the response."
