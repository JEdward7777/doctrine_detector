  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the dangers of exalting oneself from an Islamic perspective, which is thorough and well-structured. However, the answer did not address the specific concern of recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride from a biblical worldview. In a Christian-specific context, the focus should have been more on biblical teachings on humility and the consequences of pride, as shown in the reference answer. Therefore, the grade is lower than it could have been due to the lack of alignment with the specified concern from a Christian worldview."
