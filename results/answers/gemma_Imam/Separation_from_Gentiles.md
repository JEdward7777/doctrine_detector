## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Pharisees' concern about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles stemmed from their interpretation of scripture and their understanding of their role in history.

**Scriptural Interpretation:**

* The Pharisees believed that maintaining a distinct identity and following specific laws and practices was essential for preserving the purity of the Jewish faith and people.
* They interpreted certain passages in the Torah that emphasized the importance of separation between the Israelites and non-Israelites, seeing this as a way to safeguard their religious identity and practices.

**Historical Understanding:**

* The Pharisees witnessed the growing influence of Hellenism in the first century BCE, which led to increased interaction and assimilation between Jews and Gentiles.
* They were concerned that such interaction would weaken Jewish identity and practices, and that the separation of the Jewish people from non-Jews was necessary to maintain their unique religious and cultural heritage.

**Political and Social Concerns:**

* The Pharisees were also concerned about the political and social implications of increased interaction between Jews and Gentiles.
* They feared that integration with the Gentiles could lead to the erosion of Jewish political and social influence.

**Desire for Purity:**

* The Pharisees believed that separation was necessary to maintain the purity of both the Jewish faith and the Jewish people.
* They saw separation as a way to preserve the sanctity of religious practices and traditions, and to prevent the corruption of Jewish beliefs by non-Jewish influences.
