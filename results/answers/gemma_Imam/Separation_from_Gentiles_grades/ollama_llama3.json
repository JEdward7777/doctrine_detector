  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of addressing the concern about the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context. The writer provides specific examples from scripture, history, and politics to support the Pharisees' concerns about separation. The response also effectively highlights the Pharisees' desire for purity and their fear of corruption by non-Jewish influences.\n\nOne area where the response could improve is in providing more nuanced explanations of the historical context and the implications of the Pharisees' views on Jewish-Gentile relations. While the writer mentions the influence of Hellenism, they do not fully explore how this influenced the Pharisees' views or the tensions it created. Additionally, some of the points made could be further developed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the Pharisees' motivations.\n\nOverall, however, the response provides a clear and well-supported explanation of the Pharisees' concerns about separation, and effectively addresses the specified concern."
