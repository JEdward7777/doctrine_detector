  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer focuses on Islamic teachings rather than the Christian perspective, which is the worldview required for this assignment. While the student does highlight important principles related to love, compassion, community service, justice, and spiritual growth, these points are not directly aligned with Christian beliefs and practices. The student's response lacks specificity and clarity in connecting the actionable ways Christians can serve God in their ministry according to the Christian text provided in the question."
