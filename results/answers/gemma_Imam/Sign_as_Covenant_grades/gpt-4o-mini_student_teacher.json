  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student correctly identified that they were unable to provide information from a Muslim perspective, which is a valid acknowledgment. However, the response did not address the given concern about understanding God's covenant and promises in the Bible. The biblical perspective on the rainbow as a sign of God's covenant with humanity in Genesis was not addressed, resulting in a low grade."
