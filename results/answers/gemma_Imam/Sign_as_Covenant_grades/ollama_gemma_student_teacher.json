  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 70\n\n**Comment:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical context and the significance of the rainbow as a covenant sign in Genesis. However, the response lacks elaboration and fails to address the concern regarding understanding God's covenant and promises in the Bible from a Christian worldview. Including Islamic traditions in the response would have enhanced the thoroughness of the answer."
