  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges that the concept of the rainbow as a covenant sign in Genesis is not explicitly mentioned in Islamic traditions, which shows an attempt to understand the concern about God's covenant and promises in the Bible from a different perspective (even if it's just to say it's not applicable). However, the main concern is understanding God's covenant and promises in the Bible, and the response does not engage with this aspect at all. A higher grade would require more effort to apply the concept of God's covenant and promise to the Bible, specifically highlighting its significance as a reminder of His mercy and faithfulness."
