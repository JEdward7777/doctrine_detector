However, the answer deviates significantly by introducing interpretations from Islamic tradition, which may not align with a Christian worldview concerning the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs. Additionally, the key point of the baby in swaddling clothes lying in a manger as a specific indication of the Messiah's arrival, as per the reference answer, is not specifically emphasized."
