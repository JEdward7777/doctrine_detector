The discussion on parallel interpretations in Islamic tradition is insightful. However, it could have been strengthened by further connecting the signs given to the shepherds specifically to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, emphasizing the divine plan and foretelling of Jesus' birth."
