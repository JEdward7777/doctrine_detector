It effectively addresses the importance of anointing in biblical leadership roles by emphasizing the divine empowerment and special service to God associated with anointing. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly mention how anointing signifies the divine ordination and spiritual elevation of individuals in leadership roles, aligning even more closely with the Christian worldview perspective."
