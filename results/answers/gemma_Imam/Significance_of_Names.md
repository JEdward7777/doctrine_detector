## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Shaddai is significant as a title rather than a name in Bible translations due to several reasons:**

**1. Linguistic Context:**

* The term "Shaddai" is a plural form of the Arabic word "shaddah," which means "to give" or "to bestow."
* It is more accurate to translate "Shaddai" as "the Giver" or "the Bestower."

**2. Theological Understanding:**

* In Islamic theology, "Shaddai" is considered a title of Allah that emphasizes his generosity and abundance.
* The Quranic verse 57:23 states, "Say, 'He is Allah, the Giver of all that is good.'"

**3. Translational Compromise:**

* Translating "Shaddai" as a name would require altering its original meaning and significance.
* Translators often choose to render it as a title to preserve the theological context and avoid confusion.

**4. Continuity with Islamic Tradition:**

* Islamic interpretations and translations of the Bible have traditionally referred to "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name.
* This continuity with Islamic tradition is important for Muslim readers.

**5. Distinctions within the Bible:**

* In biblical contexts, the use of proper names for individuals is significant.
* Translating "Shaddai" as a title avoids confusion with other names mentioned in the Bible.
