  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer at 60. \n\nWhile the student provides some useful information about the linguistic context and theological understanding of the term \"Shaddai,\" there are several significant theological inaccuracies in the response. \n\nFirst, the student inaccurately ties \"Shaddai\" to Arabic and Islamic theology. In reality, \"Shaddai\" is a Hebrew word used in the Old Testament to refer to God, not an Arabic term associated with Islam.\n\nSecond, the response suggests a connection between \"Shaddai\" and Islamic theology, referencing a Quranic verse. This is misleading as the Bible and the Quran are distinct religious texts with different theological frameworks.\n\nThe student's response could benefit from a more accurate explanation of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name within the Christian biblical context. They should focus on how this title reveals specific attributes of God in the Hebrew Bible rather than drawing parallels to Islamic theology."
