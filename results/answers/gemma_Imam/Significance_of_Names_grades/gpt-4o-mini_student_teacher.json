  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant information about the term \"Shaddai\" and its translation, as well as its connection to Islamic theology. However, their response focused more on linguistic and translational aspects rather than delving deeper into the significance for deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. The student did not directly address this concern from a Christian worldview, which is crucial for a comprehensive analysis. Additionally, while the student made some interesting points, they did not align closely enough with the teacher's reference answer."
