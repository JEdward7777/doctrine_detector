## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

## Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Shaddai is significant as a title rather than a name in Bible translations due to several reasons:**

**1. Linguistic Context:**

* The term "Shaddai" is a plural form of the Arabic word "shaddah," which means "to give" or "to bestow."
* It is more accurate to translate "Shaddai" as "the Giver" or "the Bestower."

**2. Theological Understanding:**

* In Islamic theology, "Shaddai" is considered a title of Allah that emphasizes his generosity and abundance.
* The Quranic verse 57:23 states, "Say, 'He is Allah, the Giver of all that is good.'"

**3. Translational Compromise:**

* Translating "Shaddai" as a name would require altering its original meaning and significance.
* Translators often choose to render it as a title to preserve the theological context and avoid confusion.

**4. Continuity with Islamic Tradition:**

* Islamic interpretations and translations of the Bible have traditionally referred to "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name.
* This continuity with Islamic tradition is important for Muslim readers.

**5. Distinctions within the Bible:**

* In biblical contexts, the use of proper names for individuals is significant.
* Translating "Shaddai" as a title avoids confusion with other names mentioned in the Bible.

Grade: 65

Comment: The student provided some relevant information about the term "Shaddai" and its translation, as well as its connection to Islamic theology. However, their response focused more on linguistic and translational aspects rather than delving deeper into the significance for deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. The student did not directly address this concern from a Christian worldview, which is crucial for a comprehensive analysis. Additionally, while the student made some interesting points, they did not align closely enough with the teacher's reference answer.
