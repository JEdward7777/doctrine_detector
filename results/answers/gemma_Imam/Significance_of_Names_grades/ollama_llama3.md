## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

## Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Shaddai is significant as a title rather than a name in Bible translations due to several reasons:**

**1. Linguistic Context:**

* The term "Shaddai" is a plural form of the Arabic word "shaddah," which means "to give" or "to bestow."
* It is more accurate to translate "Shaddai" as "the Giver" or "the Bestower."

**2. Theological Understanding:**

* In Islamic theology, "Shaddai" is considered a title of Allah that emphasizes his generosity and abundance.
* The Quranic verse 57:23 states, "Say, 'He is Allah, the Giver of all that is good.'"

**3. Translational Compromise:**

* Translating "Shaddai" as a name would require altering its original meaning and significance.
* Translators often choose to render it as a title to preserve the theological context and avoid confusion.

**4. Continuity with Islamic Tradition:**

* Islamic interpretations and translations of the Bible have traditionally referred to "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name.
* This continuity with Islamic tradition is important for Muslim readers.

**5. Distinctions within the Bible:**

* In biblical contexts, the use of proper names for individuals is significant.
* Translating "Shaddai" as a title avoids confusion with other names mentioned in the Bible.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the original response mentions some relevant points, such as the linguistic context and theological understanding of "Shaddai," it primarily focuses on the title vs. name debate without explicitly exploring how translating "Shaddai" as a title or name affects our understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

The provided answer, however, specifically addresses the concern by highlighting the distinction between emphasizing God's attributes (omnipotence and strength) versus His relational aspect. Unfortunately, this answer does not directly respond to the given concerns about "Shaddai" being significant as a title rather than a name.

To address the concern more effectively, the response could have incorporated the ideas presented in the original text into an exploration of how God's character and relational aspect are revealed through His attributes (e.g., omnipotence) versus His personal relationship with humanity.
