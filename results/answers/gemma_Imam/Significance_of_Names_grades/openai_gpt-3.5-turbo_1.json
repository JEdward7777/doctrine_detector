However, the response does not specifically address the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. While it touches on the attributes of God as omnipotent and strong, it could have delved deeper into how using \"Shaddai\" as a title or name impacts one's personal relationship with God within the Christian worldview. More direct connections to Christian theology and the relational aspect with God would have strengthened the argument further."
