## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

## Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Shaddai is significant as a title rather than a name in Bible translations due to several reasons:**

**1. Linguistic Context:**

* The term "Shaddai" is a plural form of the Arabic word "shaddah," which means "to give" or "to bestow."
* It is more accurate to translate "Shaddai" as "the Giver" or "the Bestower."

**2. Theological Understanding:**

* In Islamic theology, "Shaddai" is considered a title of Allah that emphasizes his generosity and abundance.
* The Quranic verse 57:23 states, "Say, 'He is Allah, the Giver of all that is good.'"

**3. Translational Compromise:**

* Translating "Shaddai" as a name would require altering its original meaning and significance.
* Translators often choose to render it as a title to preserve the theological context and avoid confusion.

**4. Continuity with Islamic Tradition:**

* Islamic interpretations and translations of the Bible have traditionally referred to "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name.
* This continuity with Islamic tradition is important for Muslim readers.

**5. Distinctions within the Bible:**

* In biblical contexts, the use of proper names for individuals is significant.
* Translating "Shaddai" as a title avoids confusion with other names mentioned in the Bible.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations from various linguistic, theological, translational, and contextual perspectives. However, the response does not specifically address the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. While it touches on the attributes of God as omnipotent and strong, it could have delved deeper into how using "Shaddai" as a title or name impacts one's personal relationship with God within the Christian worldview. More direct connections to Christian theology and the relational aspect with God would have strengthened the argument further.
