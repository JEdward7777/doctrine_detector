While the discussion on translating \"Shaddai\" as a title provided some interesting insights, it did not directly relate to the Christian worldview and how understanding God's attributes and relational aspect impacts one's faith. Additionally, the focus on Islamic theology and continuity with Islamic tradition was not relevant to the Christian perspective on understanding God's character. More explicit connections to Christian teachings and beliefs would have strengthened the response."
