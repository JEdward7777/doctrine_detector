However, it does not directly address the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith as prompted. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more Christian-specific perspectives on how the translation of \"Shaddai\" impacts one's relationship with God within the context of Christianity."
