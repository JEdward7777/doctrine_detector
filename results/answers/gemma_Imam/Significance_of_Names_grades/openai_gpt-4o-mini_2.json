  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of why \"Shaddai\" is significant as a title rather than a name in Bible translations, addressing linguistic, theological, translational, traditional, and contextual reasons. However, it falls short of fully meeting the concern regarding deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. While it discusses the significance of using \"Shaddai\" as a title for emphasizing God's attributes, it does not explicitly connect this to fostering a personal relationship with God within the Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the response could have included more explicit references to Christian teachings and scriptures highlighting the relational aspect of God with His people."
