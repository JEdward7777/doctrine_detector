  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response correctly states that the Day of Pentecost is not significant in Islamic tradition or Quran, but it does not provide insight into the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers as per the concern. It also fails to explicitly mention Jesus' promise being fulfilled, which is mentioned in the correct answer. However, it does mention the significance of the Day of Pentecost for Christians, which shows some understanding of its importance.\n\nThe response gets 60 points because while it doesn't fully address the concern, it still provides some basic information about the Day of Pentecost and its significance to Christians."
