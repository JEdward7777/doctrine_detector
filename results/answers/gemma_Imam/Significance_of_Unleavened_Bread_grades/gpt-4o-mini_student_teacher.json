  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 20/100.\n\nWhile the student provided a well-written and insightful response regarding the symbolism of unleavened bread in Islamic tradition, the answer did not align with the Christian perspective as requested. The teacher's reference answer focused on the removal of sin and living in a way that honors God, which was not addressed in the student's response. Additionally, the references to Islamic teachings, while informative, were not relevant to the Christian worldview being assessed in this context. To improve the grade, the student should provide a response that specifically addresses the Christian perspective on unleavened bread and its symbolism in relation to sin and honoring God."
