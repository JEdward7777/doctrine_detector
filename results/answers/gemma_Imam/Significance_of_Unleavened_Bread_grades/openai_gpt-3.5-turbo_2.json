  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on unleavened bread and its symbolism in relation to sin and living a life that honors God. However, the grade is lower as the response did not adequately address the concern regarding the Christian teachings on the spiritual significance of unleavened bread. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to include a comparison or contrast with the Christian understanding of unleavened bread and its symbolism in relation to sin and honoring God."
