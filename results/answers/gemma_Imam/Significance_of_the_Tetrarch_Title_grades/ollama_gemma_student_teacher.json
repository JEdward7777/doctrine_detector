  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a limited understanding of the concept of 'tetrarch' and its relevance to the governance structure during Jesus' time. The response correctly points out that the term does not appear in Islamic texts or traditions, but it fails to acknowledge its significance in the Roman-occupied territories. The response lacks depth and fails to address the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry, as specified in the concern."
