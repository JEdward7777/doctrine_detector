Comment: The response effectively explains the significance of 'tetrarch' within the context of Roman governance, providing insights into the political dynamics of the time of Jesus. This understanding is crucial for believers to comprehend the political tensions prevalent during Christ's life and ministry. The deduction in points is due to the omission of a direct application of Christian-specific worldview in connecting the concept of 'tetrarch' to the broader narrative of Jesus' interactions with political structures during his earthly ministry.
