However, from a Christian worldview, there are key doctrinal differences regarding the significance and interpretation of signs and miracles. The answer does not address the Christian perspective on the uniqueness of Jesus' miracles as attesting to His divinity, the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies through His miracles, and the ultimate purpose of miracles being to point people to faith in Christ as the Son of God. Additionally, the answer lacks specific references to biblical passages that highlight the role of signs and miracles in validating God's message."
