  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive perspective on the role of signs and miracles in validating God's message, drawing from Islamic teachings. While the response is well-reasoned and informative, it deviates from the Christian-specific worldview requested in the concern. The answer focuses on Islamic beliefs and references the Quran and Sunnah, which do not align with the Christian perspective on this topic. In a Christian context, the emphasis is on Jesus as the central figure performing miracles to validate his divinity and the truth of God's message. The student's answer is well-structured and thorough but lacks the Christian theological framework required for this grading."
