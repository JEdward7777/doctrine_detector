However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God. It is important to provide a more thorough explanation of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the eternal relationship between Jesus and God the Father, emphasizing the divine nature of Jesus. Additionally, the response could benefit from including references to specific biblical passages that support the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God."
