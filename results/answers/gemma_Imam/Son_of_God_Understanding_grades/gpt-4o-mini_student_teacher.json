  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided some context on the Islamic perspective regarding Jesus and the 'Son of God' title, their answer did not adequately address the concern of understanding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God from a Christian worldview. The student correctly referenced Jesus being eternally begotten by God the Father, but did not emphasize Jesus' full divinity or the shared nature with God the Father. The answer would have benefitted from a stronger emphasis on Jesus' divine nature and relationship with the Father in line with Christian beliefs."
