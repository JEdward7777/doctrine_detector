## [Answer](../Son_of_God_Understanding.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The term 'Son of God' signifies that Jesus is eternally begotten by God the Father, sharing in His divine nature and glory.**

In Islamic belief, Jesus (Isa) is considered the Messenger of God and a prophet, but not as divine in nature. The concept of the 'Son of God' is not explicitly mentioned in Islamic scriptures.

**However, Islamic interpretations and scholars have debated the meaning and implications of this title in relation to Jesus' relationship with God the Father.** Some interpretations suggest that the title 'Son of God' implies a filial relationship, while others argue that it should be understood as a symbolic or metaphorical representation of Jesus' unique relationship with God.

**The Islamic perspective emphasizes:**

* Jesus' humanity and his filial relationship with God the Father is rooted in his divine parentage, not by physical birth.
* The Islamic understanding of God is monotheistic, rejecting the Trinity or the concept of divine sonship as understood in some Christian traditions.
* The relationship between Jesus and God the Father is one of perfect love, submission, and obedience.
