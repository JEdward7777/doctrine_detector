  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed comparison between the title 'Son of God' for Jesus and 'sons of God' for believers, considering etymology, relationship, nature, fulfillment, and revelation. However, the student's answer lacks the central point of distinction, which is that the title 'Son of God' specifically pertains to Jesus as God's only Son, while 'sons of God' includes all believers in Christ. The comparison provided by the student offers valuable insights but fails to address the key concern of clarity in theological discussions."
