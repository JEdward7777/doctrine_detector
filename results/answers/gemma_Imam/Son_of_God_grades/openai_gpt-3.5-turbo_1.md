* 'Sons of God' is derived from the Arabic word 'al-bashar,' meaning 'human beings.'

**2. Relationship:**

* 'Son of God' refers to a unique and intimate relationship between Jesus and God, suggesting a divine sonship.
* 'Sons of God' refers to a collective and spiritual relationship between believers and God, emphasizing their kinship with God through faith.

**3. Nature:**

* 'Sons of God' highlights the spiritual transformation and likeness to God that believers achieve through faith.

**4. Fulfillment:**
