However, the Christian perspective on this issue is missing, which is crucial when analyzing biblical texts. The answer could be improved by including the traditional Christian view on this topic based on biblical theology and doctrine. Additionally, the response could benefit from more in-depth analysis and references to specific scriptural passages supporting each interpretation."
