  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 70/100.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive overview of different interpretations of the term 'sons of God' in Genesis 6, including the angelic, human-divine, genealogical, and metaphorical interpretations. They also incorporated Islamic perspectives and relevant texts into their analysis. However, the answer could be improved by providing more depth and analysis within each interpretation, as well as directly addressing the given reference answer which focused on fallen angels, powerful political rulers, or descendants of Seth. Additionally, the student could have tied in more explicitly how understanding these interpretations aids in grasping the meaning of the scripture passage. Overall, a good effort in exploring different perspectives but lacking in depth and direct engagement with the reference answer."
