However, it does not explicitly explain why these different interpretations matter or how they relate to the meaning of scripture passages. Additionally, while the response mentions Islamic perspectives and texts, it could be more detailed and specific in its discussion.\n\nThe given answer is a good starting point for discussing the various interpretations of \"sons of God\", but it would be improved by providing more context and explanation about why these different interpretations are important for understanding scripture passages."
