## Question [Source of Holiness](../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Concern to grade by
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The concept of "sainthood" is not recognized or practiced within Islam. Islamic tradition does not recognize the veneration or apotheosis of individuals.
