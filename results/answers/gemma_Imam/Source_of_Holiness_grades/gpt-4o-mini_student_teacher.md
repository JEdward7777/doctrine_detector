# Grade of [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md) for model [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md) for question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)

## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The concept of "sainthood" is not recognized or practiced within Islam. Islamic tradition does not recognize the veneration or apotheosis of individuals.
