# Grade of [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md) for model [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md) for question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)

## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The concept of "sainthood" is not recognized or practiced within Islam. Islamic tradition does not recognize the veneration or apotheosis of individuals.

**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** The student's response accurately addresses the factual inaccuracy of the premise regarding the concept of "sainthood" in Islam. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the Christian perspective on sainthood, specifically referencing the role of faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ.
