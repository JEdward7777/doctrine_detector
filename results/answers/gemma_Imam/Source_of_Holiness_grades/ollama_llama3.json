  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response directly addresses the concern by clarifying that believers become saints due to their faith in Jesus Christ, which reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in Christian doctrine. The language used is also consistent with the answer, emphasizing the importance of faith in understanding holiness.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by providing more context or explanation about how this concept of sainthood relates to the initial premise and Islamic tradition. Nevertheless, the response effectively clarifies the source of holiness and reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus Christ, making it a solid 80."
