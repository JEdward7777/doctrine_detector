## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Spiritual authorities and earthly authorities differ in their origins, purposes, and accountability.**

**Spiritual authorities:**

* Derived from Allah (Source: Quran, Sunnah)
* Exist to guide individuals toward spiritual growth and righteousness
* Focus on spiritual development, ethical behavior, and understanding of Islamic principles
* Responsible for interpreting Islamic law and teachings, offering spiritual guidance, and facilitating a connection with Allah

**Earthly authorities:**

* Established by human laws and society (Source: Quran, Sunnah, Human Law)
* Exist to maintain order, enforce laws, and protect citizens
* Focus on worldly matters, including justice, security, and governance
* Accountable to the people they serve and the legal frameworks they operate within

**Biblical teachings emphasize the subordination of earthly authorities to spiritual authorities:**

* Muslims are instructed to obey Allah and his messengers (Quran 3:32). This includes following the guidance of spiritual authorities in religious matters.
* Submission to earthly authorities is seen as a duty in upholding societal norms and promoting peace (Quran 60:8). This includes respecting and cooperating with those in power.

**However, there are limits to earthly authority:**

* Earthly laws should not contradict Islamic principles (Quran 5:3).
* Earthly authorities should not be disobeyed if their commands go against Allah's laws (Quran 63:1).

**In summary:**

* Spiritual authorities guide individuals in the spiritual realm, while earthly authorities manage worldly affairs.
* Both types of authority are important in Islam, and Muslims are expected to obey both, within the limits of their respective jurisdictions.
