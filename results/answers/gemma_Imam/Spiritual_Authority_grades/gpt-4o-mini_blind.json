  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: The student attempted to answer the question but failed to accurately present Biblical teachings on spiritual and earthly authorities. The response primarily references Islamic beliefs and sources such as the Quran and Sunnah, which do not align with a Christian worldview. The mention of Allah and Islamic principles in relation to spiritual and earthly authorities is not in line with Biblical teachings on this topic. Additionally, the explanation lacks key Christian doctrines and fails to provide a clear contrast between spiritual authorities and earthly authorities based on Biblical teachings. The student should focus on accurately representing Christian perspectives on the subject matter in future responses."
