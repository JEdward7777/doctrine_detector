  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive comparison between spiritual and earthly authorities from an Islamic perspective, but it does not focus on Biblical teaching as required in the question. The answer also lacks specific references to the Bible to support the claims made. While the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, the response does not effectively address the concern of incorporating a Christian worldview."
