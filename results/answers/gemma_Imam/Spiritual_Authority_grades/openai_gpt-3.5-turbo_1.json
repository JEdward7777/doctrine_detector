  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a basic understanding of the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities in the context of Christianity. However, the response lacks depth and fails to reference relevant Biblical passages to support the argument. Additionally, it does not fully address the implications of this distinction in a Christian's life. More detailed explanation and direct references to Christian teachings would strengthen the response."
