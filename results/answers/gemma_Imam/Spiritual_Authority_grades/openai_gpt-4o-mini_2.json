  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided does not adequately address the concern raised. While the initial answer correctly distinguishes between spiritual and earthly authorities, it fails to apply a Christian-specific worldview. The lack of integration of Biblical teachings and Christian principles in the evaluation of the given response results in a lower grade. Further elaboration on how Christian beliefs and teachings shape the understanding of spiritual and earthly authorities would have strengthened the response."
