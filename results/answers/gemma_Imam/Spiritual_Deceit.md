## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
Based on Islamic teachings, the concept of demons playing a role in deception related to idolatry is not explicitly mentioned. Islamic beliefs emphasize the rejection of polytheism and idolatry, which revolves around the worship of multiple deities or objects.

The Islamic perspective emphasizes the belief in monotheism (belief in one God), and the rejection of any association or partnership with Allah (God). Idolatry is considered a grave sin and is strictly prohibited in Islam.

The Quran and Islamic teachings focus on the rejection of polytheism and the affirmation of the oneness of Allah. The concept of demons influencing idolatry is not a central theme in Islamic theology or jurisprudence.
