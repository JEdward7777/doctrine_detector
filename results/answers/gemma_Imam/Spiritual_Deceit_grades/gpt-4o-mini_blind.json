However, from a Christian worldview, the absence of discussion on the influence of demons in deception concerning idolatry would be considered a limitation as it overlooks the spiritual warfare aspect present in Christian theology. It is important to recognize the role demons play in leading people astray from worshipping the one true God, as evidenced in Scriptures such as Ephesians 6:12 and 1 Peter 5:8."
