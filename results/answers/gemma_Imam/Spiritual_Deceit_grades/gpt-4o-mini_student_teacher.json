  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective on the rejection of idolatry and the emphasis on monotheism. However, the answer did not address the specific concern raised about demons deceiving people into idolatry. From a Christian worldview, the focus is on the presence of spiritual deceit and demons leading people away from the truth of God. The answer did not align with this concern, resulting in a lower grade."
