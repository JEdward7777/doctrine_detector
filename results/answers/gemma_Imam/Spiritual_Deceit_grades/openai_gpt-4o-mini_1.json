While the response addresses the lack of explicit mention of demons in Islamic teachings influencing idolatry, it misses the opportunity to emphasize the importance of discerning spiritual influences and staying rooted in the truth of God's sovereignty. More direct connection to the Christian worldview concern could have further strengthened the response."
