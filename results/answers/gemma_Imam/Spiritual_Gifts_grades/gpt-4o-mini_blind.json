  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: While the student attempted to draw parallels between the concept of \"spiritual gifts\" in the Bible and Islamic beliefs, the answer falls short in providing a robust analysis from a Muslim perspective. The response could have delved deeper into specific Islamic teachings and sources to further illustrate the differences and address the implications of the concept of spiritual gifts within Islam. Additionally, the tone of caution taken by the student is commendable, but the overall depth and coherence of the response could be improved."
