  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided an extensive response from a Muslim perspective, addressing some parallels and considerations with Islamic beliefs.

The grade is low as the response diverged significantly from the Christian-specific focus on the implications of spiritual gifts as described in the Bible for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit."
