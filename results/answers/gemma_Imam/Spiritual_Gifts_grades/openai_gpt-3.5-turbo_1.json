The emphasis on seeking guidance from Islamic scholars and remaining true to Islamic principles is commendable. However, the response could further explore how the utilization of spiritual gifts in a Christian context aligns with community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. Encouraging dialogue on how different faith traditions view spiritual gifts, while maintaining respectful differences, would enrich the analysis."
