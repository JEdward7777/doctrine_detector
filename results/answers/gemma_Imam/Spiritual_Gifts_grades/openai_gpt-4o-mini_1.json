  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: \nThe response provides a detailed exploration of the concept of \"spiritual gifts\" from a Muslim perspective, drawing parallels with Islamic beliefs and practices. The points made are respectful and informative, highlighting the differences between Christian and Islamic teachings. However, the response does not directly address the concern about the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and obedience to the Holy Spirit. It mainly focuses on the incompatibility of the concept with Islamic beliefs. To improve the grade, the response could have included suggestions on how Muslims can foster community growth and obedience to Allah within the context of their faith."
