  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-structured response regarding the importance of confessing sins to one another in Islam. However, the content lacks alignment with the Christian perspective specified in the worldview for grading. The references to Allah, the Quran, and the Ummah are not applicable to a Christian context. To improve the grade, the student needs to focus on incorporating Christian beliefs, such as Jesus as the mediator between God and believers for forgiveness of sins, the importance of confession to fellow Christians for accountability and spiritual healing, and the role of the church community in supporting one another in faith."
