  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response that highlights various aspects of how confessing sins contributes to spiritual healing within an Islamic context. They demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of confession for purification of the heart, strengthening the community, seeking forgiveness, healing emotional burden, strengthening faith, encouraging supplication, and fostering empathy and compassion. While their response was detailed and informative, it could have been more directly focused on the concern of the importance of community in spiritual growth. The reference answer provided a concise and specific explanation that directly tied confessing sins to accountability, support, and encouragement among believers. Overall, the student's response was well-structured and insightful but could have been more tailored to the specified concern."
