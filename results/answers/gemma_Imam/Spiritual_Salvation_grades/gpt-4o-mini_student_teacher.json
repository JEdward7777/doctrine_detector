  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: \nThe student provided a detailed comparison between Christian and Islamic perspectives on salvation, which demonstrates a good understanding of the different beliefs. However, the response did not directly address the significance of being 'saved' in a spiritual sense according to Christian teaching, as outlined in the reference answer. The student correctly highlighted the differences in theological beliefs between Christianity and Islam but did not fully address the impact of understanding salvation on one's faith and eternal life assurance from a Christian worldview."
