It effectively connects the symbolic concept to Christian beliefs in conversion, purity of heart, renewal, transformation, and alignment with God's will. The discussion aligns well with the concern of understanding the spiritual implications of physical practices in modern Christianity, emphasizing the spiritual significance and transformational aspect of the concept. A minor improvement could be providing more direct references to biblical verses that support these interpretations."
