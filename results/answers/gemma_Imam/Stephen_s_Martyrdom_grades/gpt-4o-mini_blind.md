Comment: While it is important to be cautious when discussing sensitive matters, in this case, the student's response lacks depth and does not engage with the question at all. A proper approach would have been to acknowledge the sensitive nature of the topic but then provide a balanced and doctrinally sound analysis of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church. By avoiding discussion altogether, the response falls short of demonstrating an understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview.
