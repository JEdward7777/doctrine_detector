  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response is hesitant and avoids engaging with the question directly. While it is important to handle sensitive topics with care, the student could have acknowledged the significance of Stephen's stoning in early Christianity and the challenges faced by believers without delving into contentious interpretations. Encouraging a respectful discussion on the cost of discipleship and faithfulness would have been beneficial."
