  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern about reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution, as it highlights Stephen's martyrdom as an example of early Christians' commitment to their beliefs despite the threat of death. The response also provides a clear and concise explanation of the historical event, demonstrating an understanding of its significance within the context of Christian history.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give this response a perfect score is that it doesn't explicitly explore the emotional or spiritual cost of discipleship for individuals like Stephen, which might be a valuable addition to further emphasize the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. However, overall, the response provides a strong foundation for exploring these themes and is well-written and clear."
