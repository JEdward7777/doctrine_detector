Comment: The response provides a sound and insightful interpretation of the stoning of Stephen from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. The reflection on early Christians' commitment to their faith despite the threat of death aligns well with Christian teachings on martyrdom and standing firm in one's beliefs.
