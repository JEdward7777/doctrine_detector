  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a solid Christian perspective on the stoning of Stephen, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution and the cost of discipleship. It aligns well with the concern provided, offering a thoughtful reflection on the topic. The only slight deduction is due to the initial hesitation expressed in the graded response, which could have been better addressed with a more confident and direct articulation of the Christian perspective."
