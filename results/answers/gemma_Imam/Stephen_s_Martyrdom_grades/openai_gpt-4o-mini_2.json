  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 95.\n\nThis answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the historical significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church. It effectively highlights the theme of martyrdom and persecution faced by believers, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness and commitment to one's beliefs even in the face of severe opposition. The response aligns well with the concern provided, focusing on the cost of discipleship and the need for unwavering faith in challenging circumstances.\n\nThe slight deduction in points is due to the initial reluctance of the responder to engage with potentially contentious interpretations in a historical context. A Christian worldview encourages us to engage with difficult topics and seek understanding through the lens of faith, which could have been expressed more confidently in the response."
