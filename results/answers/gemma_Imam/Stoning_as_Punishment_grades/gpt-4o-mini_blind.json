  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "This response takes a neutral stance and defers to seeking guidance from religious authorities rather than engaging with the question from a Christian worldview. While it is appropriate to recognize the limitations of one's knowledge, in the context of a Christian-specific worldview, it is important to attempt an explanation or at least acknowledge the biblical perspective in addressing the topic. \n\nGrade: 30\n\nComment: The response lacks engagement with the question from a Christian worldview and misses the opportunity to discuss the biblical perspective on stoning as a punishment for adultery. In a Christian-specific context, it is important to address such topics with a foundation in biblical teachings."
