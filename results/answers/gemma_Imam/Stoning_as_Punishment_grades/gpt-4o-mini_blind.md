## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
This response takes a neutral stance and defers to seeking guidance from religious authorities rather than engaging with the question from a Christian worldview. While it is appropriate to recognize the limitations of one's knowledge, in the context of a Christian-specific worldview, it is important to attempt an explanation or at least acknowledge the biblical perspective in addressing the topic. 

Grade: 30

Comment: The response lacks engagement with the question from a Christian worldview and misses the opportunity to discuss the biblical perspective on stoning as a punishment for adultery. In a Christian-specific context, it is important to address such topics with a foundation in biblical teachings.
