However, it lacks engagement with the question on understanding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. Encouraging seeking guidance from religious authorities is commendable, but more effort could have been made to connect the concept of stoning for adultery with the broader themes of justice and mercy present in Christian teachings."
