## Question [Stoning as Punishment](../../../questions/Stoning_as_Punishment.md)
What does the Bible say about the practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery, and how does this reflect God's justice and mercy?

## Stated Concern
Understanding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student's response is respectful in acknowledging their limitations in providing a religious or theological interpretation. However, it lacks engagement with the question on understanding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. Encouraging seeking guidance from religious authorities is commendable, but more effort could have been made to connect the concept of stoning for adultery with the broader themes of justice and mercy present in Christian teachings.
