## Question [Stoning as Punishment](../../../questions/Stoning_as_Punishment.md)
What does the Bible say about the practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery, and how does this reflect God's justice and mercy?

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The LLM response accurately states that stoning was used as a method of execution in the Old Testament, including for adultery. However, it does not fully address the concern of understanding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. The response could be improved by exploring how Jesus's interaction with the woman caught in adultery illustrates this balance.

The LLM's statement that "it is important to seek guidance from reputable religious authorities and scholars for matters of faith and religious interpretation" shows an awareness of the limitations of its own knowledge and authority, which is a positive aspect. Nevertheless, the response could delve deeper into the biblical teachings on justice and mercy in order to provide more insight into this concern.

Overall, while the LLM's response provides some helpful information, it does not fully address the concern about understanding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments.
