Grade: 95

Comment: The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the balance between God's justice and mercy in the context of stoning for adultery. It effectively references key biblical passages to support the explanation. The only minor room for improvement would be to further emphasize the overarching theme of mercy and forgiveness in Jesus's teachings compared to strict legalism.
