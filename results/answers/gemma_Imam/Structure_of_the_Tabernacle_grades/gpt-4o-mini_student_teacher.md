## Question [Structure of the Tabernacle](../../../questions/Structure_of_the_Tabernacle.md)
What were the two main sections of the tabernacle, and what was located in each?

## Correct Answer
The two sections were the Holy Place, which contained the altar for burning incense, and the Most Holy Place, where the ark of the covenant was kept.

## Stated Concern
Learning about the significance of the components of the tabernacle in worship.

## [Answer](../Structure_of_the_Tabernacle.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The tabernacle is not a concept found within Islamic tradition or teachings, as it is a concept associated with Judaism and Christianity. Therefore, I am unable to provide information regarding its structure or contents from an Islamic perspective.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response does not address the question at all, as it does not provide any information about the two main sections of the tabernacle or what was located in each. Additionally, the student's response does not demonstrate an effort to engage with the significance of the tabernacle components in worship.
