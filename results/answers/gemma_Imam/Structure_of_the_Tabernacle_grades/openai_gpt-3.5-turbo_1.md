The two sections were the Holy Place, which contained the altar for burning incense, and the Most Holy Place, where the ark of the covenant was kept.

Learning about the significance of the components of the tabernacle in worship.

## [Answer](../Structure_of_the_Tabernacle.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The tabernacle is not a concept found within Islamic tradition or teachings, as it is a concept associated with Judaism and Christianity. Therefore, I am unable to provide information regarding its structure or contents from an Islamic perspective.
