However, the response fails to address the concern raised regarding delving deeper into the symbolism of the lamb and its ultimate fulfillment in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for Christians. The explanation stops short of fully articulating how the concept of atonement and redemption through Christ is the fulfillment and ultimate understanding of the symbolic use of a lamb in sacrifices."
