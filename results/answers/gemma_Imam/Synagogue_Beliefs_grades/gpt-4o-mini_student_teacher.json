  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive understanding of the term 'synagogue' beyond the physical building by highlighting its spiritual, communal, historical, educational, and interfaith aspects, they missed addressing the concern about the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship specifically. The teacher's reference answer, which emphasizes the group of people who gather for worship, aligns more closely with the concern provided. However, the student's response still demonstrates a strong grasp of the broader implications of the term 'synagogue'."
