Comment: While the response does touch on the communal aspect of gathering in worship, it falls short of fully addressing the significance and importance of this aspect. The provided answer only mentions that the term 'synagogue' can refer figuratively to the group of people who meet there for worship, but it does not delve deeper into the spiritual connection and community building that occurs within a synagogue. To better address the concern, the response should have explored more thoroughly the communal nature of worship and how it relates to the overall concept of 'synagogue'.
