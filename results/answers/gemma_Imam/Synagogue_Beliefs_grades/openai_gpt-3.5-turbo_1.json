However, there is a slight oversight in directly addressing the concern of the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship, as indicated by the term 'synagogue'. While it touches on the community center function and communal activities of synagogues, it could have elaborated more specifically on the communal worship experience and its significance within the synagogue context."
