While it does not explicitly address the communal aspect of gathering for worship as indicated by the term 'synagogue', the emphasis on community involvement and spiritual connection does indirectly touch upon the significance of worship gatherings within the synagogue context. However, a more direct engagement with the communal worship aspect would have further enhanced the response."
