## Question [Synagogue Purpose](../../questions/Synagogue_Purpose.md)
What role did synagogues play in the worship practices of Jews during ancient times?

## Target answer from notes
Synagogues served as places for prayer, scripture reading, and teaching about the scriptures, especially for Jews living far from the temple in Jerusalem.

## Concern to grade by
Understanding the historical and religious importance of synagogues in Jewish worship.

## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Synagogues were not a part of the worship practices of Jews during ancient times. Judaism practiced worship in temples and later in synagogues, which were places of study and prayer, not for worship rituals.</end_of_turn>
