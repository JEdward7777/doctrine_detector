Comment: The student accurately points out that synagogues were not used for the same worship rituals as the temples in ancient Jewish practices. They correctly note that synagogues were primarily places of study and prayer. However, the response could have been strengthened by elaborating on the significance and functions of synagogues in Jewish life during ancient times. Additionally, integrating some references to relevant biblical and historical examples could have provided a more comprehensive answer.
