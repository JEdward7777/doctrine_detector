However, the inclusion of references to Allah and Islamic beliefs introduces a different religious perspective that is not in line with the Christian worldview, which may cause confusion and misinterpretation for those seeking a Christian understanding of the temple in the context of Old Testament worship. It is important to maintain the focus on the Old Testament background and Christian perspective when discussing topics related to biblical history and worship practices."
