However, the added information about the temple serving as a place for Muslims to worship Allah and the inclusion of Quranic verses and Islamic traditions deviates from the context of Old Testament worship. The perspective presented does not align with a Christian worldview regarding the temple built by King Solomon in Jerusalem."
