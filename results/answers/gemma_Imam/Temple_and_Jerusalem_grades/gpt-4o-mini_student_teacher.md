Comment: The student's refusal to engage with the question based on concerns of misinformation or bias is commendable, yet in this case, it led to an incomplete and inaccurate response. It is important to acknowledge the historical and religious significance of the term "Zion" in relation to the temple in Jerusalem, which the student failed to address.
