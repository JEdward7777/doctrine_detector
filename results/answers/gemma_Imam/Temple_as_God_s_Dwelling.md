## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The concept of the temple as God's dwelling is not explicitly expressed in the Quran or Islamic traditions.**

The Quran emphasizes the importance of purity and monotheism, and does not recognize the need for physical temples or idols. Islamic teachings focus on the belief in Allah as the one true God, and the believer's connection with him through prayer, devotion, and upholding Islamic values.

Therefore, concepts related to temples as physical structures are not relevant within Islamic beliefs.
