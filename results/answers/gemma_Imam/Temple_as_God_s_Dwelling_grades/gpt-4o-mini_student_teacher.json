  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student inaccurately focused on Islamic beliefs and did not address the theological implications of God dwelling among His people within the context of the Old and New Testaments. The answer did not engage with the Christian-specific worldview or provide a comparison between the Old and New Testaments as the teacher's answer did. The lack of relevance to the given concern significantly impacts the grade."
