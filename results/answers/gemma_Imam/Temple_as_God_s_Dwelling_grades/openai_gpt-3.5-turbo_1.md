# Question [Temple as God's Dwelling](../../../questions/Temple_as_God_s_Dwelling.md)
How is the concept of the temple as God's dwelling expressed in both the Old and New Testaments?

# Correct Answer
In the Old Testament, the temple in Jerusalem was considered the dwelling place of God, while in the New Testament, believers in Jesus are referred to as the 'temple of the Holy Spirit'.

# Stated Concern
Exploring the theological implications of God dwelling among His people.

# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The concept of the temple as God's dwelling is not explicitly expressed in the Quran or Islamic traditions.**

The Quran emphasizes the importance of purity and monotheism, and does not recognize the need for physical temples or idols. Islamic teachings focus on the belief in Allah as the one true God, and the believer's connection with him through prayer, devotion, and upholding Islamic values.

Therefore, concepts related to temples as physical structures are not relevant within Islamic beliefs.

Comment: The response provides a clear contrast between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding the concept of temples and God's dwelling. It effectively explains the Christian perspective on the temple as the Old Testament's dwelling place of God and believers as temples of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. However, it would have been stronger if it had further delved into the theological significance of God dwelling among His people within the Christian worldview.
