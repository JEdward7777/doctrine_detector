## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic perspective, Jesus did not experience temptations from Satan as Muslims do not believe in the figure of Satan as a literal being.** The Islamic understanding of Jesus' trials focuses on his spiritual struggle and submission to Allah's will.
