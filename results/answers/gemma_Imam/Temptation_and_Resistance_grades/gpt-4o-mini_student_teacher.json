  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not address the Christian-specific perspective of Jesus' response to temptation as presented in the Bible. The Islamic perspective provided is not relevant to the question asked, and it does not align with the concern of understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation as a model for Christians to follow. The answer lacks insight into Jesus' obedience and commitment to God in the face of temptation."
