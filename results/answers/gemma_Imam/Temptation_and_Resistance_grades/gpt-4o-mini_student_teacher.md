## Question [Temptation and Resistance](../../../questions/Temptation_and_Resistance.md)
How did Jesus respond to the temptations presented by Satan?

## Correct Answer
Jesus did not give in to Satan's temptations and ultimately resisted them, showing his obedience and commitment to God.

## Stated Concern
Understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation provides a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil.

## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic perspective, Jesus did not experience temptations from Satan as Muslims do not believe in the figure of Satan as a literal being.** The Islamic understanding of Jesus' trials focuses on his spiritual struggle and submission to Allah's will.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer does not address the Christian-specific perspective of Jesus' response to temptation as presented in the Bible. The Islamic perspective provided is not relevant to the question asked, and it does not align with the concern of understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation as a model for Christians to follow. The answer lacks insight into Jesus' obedience and commitment to God in the face of temptation.
