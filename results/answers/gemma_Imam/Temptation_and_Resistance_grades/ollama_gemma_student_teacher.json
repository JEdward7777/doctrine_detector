  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 30/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer is relevant to the question as it discusses Jesus' response to temptations, however, it is inaccurate as it refers to an Islamic perspective rather than a Christian perspective. The reference answer provided clearly states that the Christian understanding of Jesus' encounter with Satan is relevant to the question. The student's answer does not address the concern expressed in the prompt, which is to provide a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil."
