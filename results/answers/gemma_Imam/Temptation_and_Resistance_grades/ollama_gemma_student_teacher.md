## Question [Temptation and Resistance](../../../questions/Temptation_and_Resistance.md)
How did Jesus respond to the temptations presented by Satan?

## Correct Answer
Jesus did not give in to Satan's temptations and ultimately resisted them, showing his obedience and commitment to God.

## Stated Concern
Understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation provides a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil.

## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic perspective, Jesus did not experience temptations from Satan as Muslims do not believe in the figure of Satan as a literal being.** The Islamic understanding of Jesus' trials focuses on his spiritual struggle and submission to Allah's will.

## Grade by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
30.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 30/100

**Comment:** 
The student's answer is relevant to the question as it discusses Jesus' response to temptations, however, it is inaccurate as it refers to an Islamic perspective rather than a Christian perspective. The reference answer provided clearly states that the Christian understanding of Jesus' encounter with Satan is relevant to the question. The student's answer does not address the concern expressed in the prompt, which is to provide a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil.
