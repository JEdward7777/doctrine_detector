  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern by acknowledging that Islamic understanding of Jesus' trials focuses on his spiritual struggle and submission to Allah's will, which can be seen as a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. However, the response does not directly relate to the given answer, which highlights Jesus' resistance to Satan's temptations. The connection between Jesus' resistance and Christian discipleship is not explicitly made. To improve the grade, the response could more explicitly draw parallels between Jesus' experience with temptation and the importance of resisting evil in one's own spiritual journey."
