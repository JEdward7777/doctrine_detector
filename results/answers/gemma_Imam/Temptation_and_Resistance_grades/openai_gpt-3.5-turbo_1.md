Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively highlights Jesus' resistance to temptation as a model for Christians to follow in their spiritual battles against evil. It accurately reflects Christian beliefs and teachings on this matter. The only reason for a slightly lower grade is the lack of direct engagement with the Islamic perspective mentioned in the initial response. Acknowledging and addressing different religious viewpoints can enrich the discussion further.
