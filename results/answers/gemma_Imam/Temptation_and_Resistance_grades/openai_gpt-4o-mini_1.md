Grade: 70

Comment: The response accurately conveys the Christian belief that Jesus resisted temptations from Satan, demonstrating obedience to God. However, the concern regarding the importance of Jesus' resistance as a model for Christians is not directly addressed in the response. The student could have elaborated more on how Christians can emulate Jesus' example in their own spiritual battles against evil.
