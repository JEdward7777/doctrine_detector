However, from a Christian specific worldview, it is important to also acknowledge the role of Satan as a literal being who tempts individuals, contrasting with the perspective presented in the Islamic response. Therefore, while the response is generally sound, it could be strengthened by emphasizing the significance of Jesus' victory over Satan as a key aspect of Christian belief and theology."
