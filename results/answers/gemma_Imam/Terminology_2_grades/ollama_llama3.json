  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response does acknowledge that there are different terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, it only mentions two terms (\"communion\" and \"Last Supper\"), which is significantly incomplete compared to the original list provided. The concern specified emphasizes understanding the various terms used within Christianity, but this response falls short in addressing that concern. It does not demonstrate a sufficient grasp of the different terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, leaving much room for improvement."
