Comment: The answer provides alternative terms in a Muslim context which are conceptually similar to the role of a deacon in Christianity. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that the specific role of a deacon is grounded in New Testament teachings and practices within the Christian faith. The answer could have benefitted from a clearer distinction between Islamic roles and the Christian role of a deacon. Recommending further research and understanding of the Christian doctrine on deacons would enhance the response.
