  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: While the student provided alternative terms for a deacon in a Muslim context, the answer did not directly address the concern of recognizing service roles within the church from a Christian worldview. The focus on Islamic terminology, while informative, deviated from the specific Christian perspective required for this question. The student could have included terms like \"church minister\" or \"church servant\" to align more closely with the Christian context."
