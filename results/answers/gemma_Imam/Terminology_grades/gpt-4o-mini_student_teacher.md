* **Mu'azzin:** One who calls the Muslim community to prayer.
* **Murshid:** A spiritual guide or counselor.
* **Khadim:** A servant of God.
* **Muwallid:** One who supports and helps others in religious activities.

**Additional Notes:**

* In Islam, the concept of deacon is not explicitly defined. The roles and responsibilities of those who assist the Imam are often referred to using general terms like "helpers" or "supporters."
* The specific roles and duties of deacons may vary depending on the Islamic tradition and community.
* It is important to consult Islamic scholars and community leaders for guidance on appropriate terminology and practices.

Grade: 65

Comment: While the student provided alternative terms for a deacon in a Muslim context, the answer did not directly address the concern of recognizing service roles within the church from a Christian worldview. The focus on Islamic terminology, while informative, deviated from the specific Christian perspective required for this question. The student could have included terms like "church minister" or "church servant" to align more closely with the Christian context.
