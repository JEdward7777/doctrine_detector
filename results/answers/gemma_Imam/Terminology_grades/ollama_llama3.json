  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response does attempt to recognize alternative terms for deacon-like roles, which aligns with the concern of identifying service roles within the church. However, it primarily focuses on Islamic terminology, rather than exploring Christian equivalents or parallels. While this may be an important exercise in ecumenical understanding, it falls short of addressing the specific concern stated, which is recognizing various ways to identify service roles within a Christian context. The response also does not provide direct connections between these Muslim terms and their potential relevance to Christian deacon-like roles. To increase the grade, the response could have more explicitly explored how these Islamic concepts might inform or illuminate Christian understandings of service and ministry."
