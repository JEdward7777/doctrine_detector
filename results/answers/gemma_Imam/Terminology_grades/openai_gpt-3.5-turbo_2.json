The additional notes acknowledge the potential variations in roles and the importance of seeking guidance from Islamic scholars and community leaders. The suggestions align well with the concern of recognizing different ways to identify service roles within a religious community. Great effort in integrating a Christian-specific worldview to assess and appreciate the diversity of terminology in service roles across different faith traditions."
