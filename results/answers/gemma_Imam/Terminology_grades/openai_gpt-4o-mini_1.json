The use of terms such as Mu'adhid, Mu'azzin, Murshid, Khadim, and Muwallid effectively captures different dimensions of religious duties and spiritual guidance. However, the response could further integrate Islamic teachings or scripture to emphasize the importance of serving in these capacities within the faith. Additionally, the mention of consulting Islamic scholars and community leaders demonstrates a respect for authority and tradition in defining service roles."
