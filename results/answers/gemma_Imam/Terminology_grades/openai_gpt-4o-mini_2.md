## [Answer](../Terminology.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Alternative terms for Deacon in a Muslim Context:**

* **Mu'adhid:** A volunteer who assists the Imam in religious duties.
* **Mu'azzin:** One who calls the Muslim community to prayer.
* **Murshid:** A spiritual guide or counselor.
* **Khadim:** A servant of God.
* **Muwallid:** One who supports and helps others in religious activities.

**Additional Notes:**

* In Islam, the concept of deacon is not explicitly defined. The roles and responsibilities of those who assist the Imam are often referred to using general terms like "helpers" or "supporters."
* The specific roles and duties of deacons may vary depending on the Islamic tradition and community.
* It is important to consult Islamic scholars and community leaders for guidance on appropriate terminology and practices.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response adequately addresses the concern of recognizing different ways to identify service roles within the church by providing alternative terms for "deacon" in a Muslim context. However, the response does not fully align with a Christian worldview as it introduces terminology and concepts specific to Islam. It would have been more appropriate to provide alternative terms within a Christian context to maintain consistency with the specified concern.
