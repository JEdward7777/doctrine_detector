The terms provided - Ahl al-Bayt, Banu Isl\u0101m, and Ummah al-Mu'min\u012bn - are not used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible. The correct terms are 'Hebrews,' 'Israelites,' and 'Jews.' The answer provided by the student does not demonstrate an understanding of the question or the context within a Christian worldview."
