  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective on why it is considered wrong to put God to the test. They highlighted key principles such as the infinite knowledge and power of God, the importance of faith and trust, and the consequences of testing God. Although the student's response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic beliefs, it does not directly address the concern provided, which is about maintaining a proper relationship with God. A more direct connection to the specified concern would have enhanced the response and earned a higher grade."
