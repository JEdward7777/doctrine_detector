**Herod Antipas, or Herod the tetrarch, plays significant roles in the New Testament:**

**1. King of Galilee:**

* Herod was appointed by the Roman Emperor Augustus as the tetrarch of Galilee in 37 AD.
* He maintained control over Galilee until his execution in 4 AD.
* His rule was characterized by severe punishment and oppression of the Jewish population.

**2. Role in Jesus' Birth:**

* Tradition tells us that Herod feared the birth of a new king who would threaten his power.

* This event is known as the "Massacre of the Innocents."

**3. Involvement in Jesus' Persecution:**

* Herod was responsible for ordering the arrest of Jesus during his final week.

* Herod's soldiers mocked and humiliated Jesus before he was handed over to Pontius Pilate for crucifixion.

Comment: The answer provides a thorough overview of Herod Antipas' significant roles in the New Testament. The description of his historical role as King of Galilee and his involvement in Jesus' birth and persecution is accurate. However, the mention of Herod as a hero of the Greeks may not be fully supported by biblical accounts, and the portrayal of conflict with the Pharisees leading to Jesus' crucifixion could be further clarified in its theological implications. Additionally, the student could strengthen the answer by incorporating more biblical references to support the points made. Overall, a solid response, but with room for deeper theological exploration.
