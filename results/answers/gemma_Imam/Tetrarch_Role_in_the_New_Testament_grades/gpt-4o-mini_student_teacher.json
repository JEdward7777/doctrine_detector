However, the student missed mentioning Herod's direct involvement in the beheading of John the Baptist and the trial of Jesus before Pilate, which are key events in understanding his role in the biblical narrative. Remembering these crucial details would have further enhanced the student's response in aligning with the Christian worldview."
