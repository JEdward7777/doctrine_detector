**Herod Antipas, or Herod the tetrarch, plays significant roles in the New Testament:**

**1. King of Galilee:**

* Herod was appointed by the Roman Emperor Augustus as the tetrarch of Galilee in 37 AD.
* He maintained control over Galilee until his execution in 4 AD.
* His rule was characterized by severe punishment and oppression of the Jewish population.

**2. Role in Jesus' Birth:**

* Tradition tells us that Herod feared the birth of a new king who would threaten his power.
* In an attempt to eliminate the potential threat, he ordered the slaughter of all male children under two years of age in Bethlehem.
* This event is known as the "Massacre of the Innocents."

**3. Involvement in Jesus' Persecution:**

* Herod was responsible for ordering the arrest of Jesus during his final week.
* He found no evidence of wrongdoing but was motivated by envy and political pressure.
* Herod's soldiers mocked and humiliated Jesus before he was handed over to Pontius Pilate for crucifixion.

**4. Hero of the Greeks:**

* Herod was known for his military prowess and his ability to maintain Roman control in Galilee.
* He was seen as a hero by the non-Jewish population, who admired his military skill and his construction projects.

**5. Conflict with the Pharisees:**

* Herod's rule was often marked by conflict with the Pharisees, who criticized his harsh policies and his disregard for religious traditions.
* This tension culminated in the Pharisees' request for Jesus' crucifixion.

**Herod's actions and decisions had a profound impact on the events of the New Testament and the early Christian Church.**
