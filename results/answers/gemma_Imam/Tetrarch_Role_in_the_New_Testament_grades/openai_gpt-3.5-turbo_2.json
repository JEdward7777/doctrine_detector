  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of Herod Antipas's significance in the New Testament, including his roles as the King of Galilee, his involvement in Jesus' birth and persecution, his reputation among the Greeks, and his conflicts with the Pharisees. It shows a good understanding of the historical and biblical context of Herod Antipas, addressing the concern raised effectively. However, the response could have further elaborated on Herod's role in the beheading of John the Baptist to align more closely with the given answer. Overall, a well-written and informative response deserving of a high grade."
