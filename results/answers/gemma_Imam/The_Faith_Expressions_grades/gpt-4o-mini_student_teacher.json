  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of what it means to \"keep the faith\" in the context of belief in Jesus, emphasizing maintaining, strengthening, and being steadfast in faith, and highlighting key aspects of the Islamic perspective on Jesus. However, the student's answer focused more on Islamic teachings related to Jesus rather than specifically Christian beliefs. Additionally, the student's response did not directly align with the reference answer given by the teacher, which could have been improved upon."
