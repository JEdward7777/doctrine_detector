It also outlines the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the practices involved in keeping the faith in Islam. However, the response does not directly address the concern of perseverance in faith, as it primarily focuses on understanding and maintaining belief rather than the aspect of perseverance through challenges and difficulties. Additional emphasis on the importance of perseverance in faith would have strengthened the response further."
