## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Quran does not contain any specific records of Jesus giving commands to his disciples before ascending to heaven. Islamic tradition primarily focuses on the teachings and practices of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 0

Comment: The student's answer does not address the question at all, as it delves into Islamic tradition instead of focusing on Jesus' command to His disciples. It is important to answer questions from a Christian worldview perspective when discussing Jesus and His teachings.
