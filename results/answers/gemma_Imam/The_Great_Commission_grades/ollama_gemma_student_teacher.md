## Grade: 0/100

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear misunderstanding of both the Christian and Islamic traditions. It incorrectly asserts that the Quran contains no record of Jesus giving commands to his disciples, despite the well-documented account in the Gospel accounts. Additionally, the response displays a lack of understanding of the Great Commission, which is central to Christianity.
