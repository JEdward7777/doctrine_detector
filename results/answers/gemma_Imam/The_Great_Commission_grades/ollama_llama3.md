# Grade of [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md) for model [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md) for question [The Great Commission](../../../questions/The_Great_Commission.md)

## Question [The Great Commission](../../../questions/The_Great_Commission.md)
What command did Jesus give to His disciples before ascending to heaven?

## Correct Answer
Jesus commanded His disciples to make other disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey everything He had commanded.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission.

## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Quran does not contain any specific records of Jesus giving commands to his disciples before ascending to heaven. Islamic tradition primarily focuses on the teachings and practices of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
30.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 30.

The response does not directly address the concern of understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission, which is to make disciples of all nations. Instead, it focuses on the Quran and Islamic tradition, which is unrelated to the topic of Jesus' commission to His disciples. The response also fails to acknowledge or engage with the biblical text provided, which is central to understanding the mission of discipleship.

To improve this response, it would be helpful to explicitly address the concern by discussing how Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations relates to the Great Commission and the broader mission of evangelism and discipleship. The response could also benefit from a more direct comparison between Islamic tradition and Christian theology, as well as a deeper engagement with the biblical text provided.
