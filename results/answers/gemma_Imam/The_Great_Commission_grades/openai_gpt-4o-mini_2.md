## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Quran does not contain any specific records of Jesus giving commands to his disciples before ascending to heaven. Islamic tradition primarily focuses on the teachings and practices of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately presents the Christian perspective on Jesus commanding His disciples to make disciples of all nations, baptize them, and teach them to obey His commands, known as the Great Commission from the Bible (Matthew 28:19-20). The context of discipleship in carrying out this mission is clearly understood. The deduction of points is due to the lack of integration of a Christian worldview in response to the Islamic perspective presented in the original answer.
