  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the principle of mercy in God's judgment, which is informative. However, the question specifically asked for an understanding and interpretation of James 2:13 from a Christian worldview, not an Islamic one. The student did not address the verse itself or provide an analysis within the framework of Christian theology. In grading from a Christian-specific worldview, this answer did not directly engage with the primary focus of the question."
