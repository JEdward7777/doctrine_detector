## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**From a Muslim perspective:**

The Islamic faith acknowledges the divine origins of Jesus (Isa) as a prophet of God. However, we do not consider him to be the Son of God or the Messiah.

* **Jesus (Isa)** is mentioned in the Quran as a prophet and messenger of Allah, who performed miracles and taught people about God's message of peace and monotheism.
* **Christ** is not a term explicitly used in the Quran. It is a title or epithet given to Jesus in the Bible by Christians.

**The relationship between the two terms:**

* **Jesus is the Christ:** In Christianity, Christ refers to Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah. This belief is not shared by Muslims.
* **Both terms refer to the same person:** Muslims believe that Jesus and Christ are two different names or titles for the same divine being.

**Therefore, the terms 'Jesus' and 'Christ' are related as they refer to the same individual, but they represent different theological perspectives.**
