  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the relationship between the terms \"Jesus\" and \"Christ\" from a Muslim perspective. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of the title \"Christ\" in Christianity and its connection to the concept of the Messiah. The student's conclusion correctly highlights the different theological perspectives on the two terms.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the Christian worldview."
