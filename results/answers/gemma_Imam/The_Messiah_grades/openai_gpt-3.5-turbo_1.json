While it acknowledges Jesus as a prophet, it falls short of affirming Jesus's identity as the Messiah as understood in Christianity. There is a clear contrast in theological perspectives between Islam and Christianity regarding Jesus's identity, which affects the overall response to clarifying Jesus's identity as the Messiah and its implications."
