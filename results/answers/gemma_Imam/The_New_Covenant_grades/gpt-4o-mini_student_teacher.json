  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid interpretation of the concept of God writing His law on the people's hearts in the New Covenant context, emphasizing the transformative power of faith in Jesus Christ. The Biblical interpretation presented is insightful and shows an understanding of the shift from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant. The inclusion of the Islamic perspective adds an interesting comparison, although it is slightly off-topic. Overall, the student demonstrated a good grasp of the concept, but could have focused more on the Christian-specific interpretation without branching into comparisons with other faiths."
