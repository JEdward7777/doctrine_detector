It addresses the concern by discussing the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant in a clear and cohesive manner. The integration of a Christian worldview throughout the interpretation and comparison with an Islamic perspective adds depth to the analysis. However, it would have been beneficial to further highlight the unique aspects of the New Covenant in contrast to the Old Testament law for a more comprehensive understanding."
