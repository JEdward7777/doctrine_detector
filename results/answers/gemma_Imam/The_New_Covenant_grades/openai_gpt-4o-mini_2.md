* The New Covenant emphasizes an intimate and personal relationship with God based on love and grace, rather than strict legalism.

**Islamic Perspective:**

* The concept of hearts being illuminated with divine knowledge aligns with the Islamic belief in the role of the Holy Spirit (Ruh al-Qudus) in guiding and empowering believers.
* In Islam, the Quran and Sunnah serve as external sources of guidance, while the inner transformation of the heart is crucial for righteous actions.

**Meaning in the Context of Islam:**

* The New Covenant concept reflects the Islamic belief in the universality of faith and the potential for transformation among all people.
* It highlights the importance of spiritual growth and the development of moral character in the Muslim community.
