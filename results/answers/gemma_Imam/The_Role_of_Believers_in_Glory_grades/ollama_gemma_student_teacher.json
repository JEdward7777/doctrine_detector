  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer correctly acknowledges that the concept of believers being glorified with Christ is not explicitly mentioned in Islamic theology or scripture. However, it would have benefited from further elaboration to explain why this concept is not relevant or applicable within the Islamic worldview. The response could have explored alternative perspectives or interpretations related to the concept of glory within Islamic tradition. Additionally, the response did not address the student's concern regarding the importance of understanding this hope for faith and perseverance."
