Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of understanding the concept of believers being glorified with Christ for faith and perseverance, and provides a clear interpretation from a Christian perspective. The only deduction is due to the lack of exploration from a Muslim perspective, which could have provided additional depth to the analysis.
