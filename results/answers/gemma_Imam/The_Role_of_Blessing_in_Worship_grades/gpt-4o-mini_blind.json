However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to clarify that in Christianity, the act of blessing is more focused on invoking God's favor, protection, and guidance upon individuals or objects rather than solely being an act of praising God. Additionally, the emphasis on blessings in Islam could be juxtaposed with the concept of blessings in Christianity, highlighting differences in belief and practice. Further integration of Christian theological perspectives on blessings would enhance the response."
