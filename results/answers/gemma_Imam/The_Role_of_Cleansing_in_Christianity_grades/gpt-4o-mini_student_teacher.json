  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-organized explanation of the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible and its connection to New Testament teachings about sin and redemption. They effectively highlighted the parallels between Old Testament cleansing rituals and the purification of hearts in the New Testament. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the central message that Jesus' sacrifice provides the ultimate cleansing from sin in the New Testament teachings, as emphasized in the reference answer."
