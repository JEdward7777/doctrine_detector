  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and comprehensive response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the relationship between the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible and the New Testament teachings about sin and redemption from a Christian perspective. The student clearly articulates the significance of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate cleansing power and connects it to the idea of transformation and renewal in the Christian faith."
