  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response does a good job in explaining the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible and connecting it to New Testament teachings on sin and redemption. The student provides a clear understanding of how Jesus' sacrifice is the ultimate cleansing from sin. However, the response could have achieved a higher grade if it had included more explicit references or examples linking Old Testament practices with New Testament teachings to demonstrate a deeper appreciation for the significance of Christ's redemptive work."
