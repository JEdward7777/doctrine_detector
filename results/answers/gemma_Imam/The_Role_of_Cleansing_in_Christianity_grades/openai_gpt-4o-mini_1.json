The connection between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings could have been explored in more depth to further enhance the appreciation of Christ's redemptive work. Nonetheless, the response effectively demonstrates how the concept of cleansing aligns with Christian beliefs and emphasizes the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice."
