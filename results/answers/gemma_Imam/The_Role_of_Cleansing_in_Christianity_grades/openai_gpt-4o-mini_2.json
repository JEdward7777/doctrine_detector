It highlights the importance of purification, forgiveness, and transformation in the Christian faith. However, the response could further deepen the appreciation for Christ's redemptive work by explicitly reflecting on the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings. Integrating this aspect would enhance the overall analysis and provide a more comprehensive understanding from a Christian worldview."
