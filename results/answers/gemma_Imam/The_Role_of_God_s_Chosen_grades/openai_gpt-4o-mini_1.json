The connection to recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders and its implications for the Christian community is clear and well-articulated. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the unique role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate 'chosen one' in relation to God's sovereignty and leadership in Christianity."
