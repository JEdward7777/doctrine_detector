However, the primary focus of the answer should have been on the fact that they were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and tasked with continuing His teachings after His ascension, as per the reference answer. While the additional points about their relationship with Jesus, role in spreading the faith, leadership, sacrifice, spiritual guidance, and role model status are relevant, they slightly deviate from the central theme laid out in the reference answer."
