## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The concept of the Antichrist is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible as understood by Muslims. The Islamic understanding of eschatology differs significantly from Christian interpretations.

In Islamic tradition, the concept of the Dajjal (Antichrist) is mentioned in the Quran and Islamic hadith. The Dajjal is described as a powerful and evil being who will emerge towards the end of time to deceive and harm humanity.

The Islamic perspective emphasizes the importance of following Islamic teachings and upholding Islamic values as a defense against the Dajjal's influence.
