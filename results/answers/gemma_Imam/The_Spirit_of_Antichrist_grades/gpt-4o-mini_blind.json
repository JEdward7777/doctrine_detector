However, from a Christian perspective, the response lacks a clear explanation of the Biblical view on the spirit of antichrist. It would have been more beneficial to address specific Bible verses like 1 John 4:3 and 1 John 2:18 that talk about the spirit of antichrist being already present in the world. The response should include more content related to the Biblical understanding of this concept."
