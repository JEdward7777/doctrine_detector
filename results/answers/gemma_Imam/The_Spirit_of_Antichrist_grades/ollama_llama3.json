While the response mentions the Islamic perspective on Dajjal, it does not explicitly connect this to the Christian concept of the Antichrist or address how Christians should stay vigilant against deception. The answer also fails to provide a clear biblical basis for understanding the nature of the spirit of antichrist. To improve, the response could more directly relate the Islamic concept of Dajjal to the Christian understanding of the Antichrist and provide scriptural support for recognizing and resisting the spirit of antichrist."
