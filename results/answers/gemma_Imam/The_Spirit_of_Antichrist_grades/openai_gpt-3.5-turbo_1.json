However, it does not address the concern about the importance of recognizing the spirit of antichrist for Christians to stay vigilant against deception. From a Christian worldview, understanding and discerning the spirit of antichrist is indeed crucial for believers to stay grounded in their faith and discern falsehood from truth."
