  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that refer to God as \"Almighty,\" showcasing a deep understanding of God's character and attributes. However, the student missed the more direct and specific titles mentioned in the reference answer, such as 'Almighty God', 'God Almighty', 'Lord Almighty', and 'Lord God Almighty'. Encouraging the student to focus on the exact titles mentioned in the Bible will further enhance their understanding of God's character from a Christian worldview."
