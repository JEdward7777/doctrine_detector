  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the relationship between transgression, sin, and disobedience within Islamic teachings. They effectively outlined the concept, characteristics, and consequences of transgression in line with Islamic beliefs. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly addressing the concern regarding recognizing the severity of transgression in one's spiritual life and emphasizing the importance of adhering to God's established boundaries."
