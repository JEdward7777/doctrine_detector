## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle due to several factors.

**1. Completion of Allah's Covenant:**

* The tabernacle was a temporary sanctuary during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness.
* Its purpose was to house the Ark of the Covenant, which symbolized the covenant between Allah and the Israelites.
* Once the Israelites reached their promised land and built the Temple in Jerusalem, the need for a temporary sanctuary vanished.

**2. Transition to a Permanent Temple:**

* The Tabernacle was a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem, which was a permanent place of worship.
* The Israelites believed that the Temple would be a more fitting and enduring dwelling place for the Ark and the presence of Allah.

**3. Symbolic Fulfillment:**

* The Tabernacle was a symbolic representation of Allah's dwelling among his people.
* Once the Temple was built, it became the physical manifestation of that dwelling place.

**4. Fulfillment of Prophecy:**

* The Quran and Islamic tradition both suggest that the Israelites were instructed by Allah to build a permanent temple in Jerusalem as a culmination of their journey.
* This prophecy was fulfilled with the completion of the First Temple.
