The use of Allah, Quran, and Islamic traditions in relation to the Israelites and their religious practices is not consistent with Christian beliefs. The foundational aspects of the tabernacle, Temple, Ark of the Covenant, and the covenant itself should be rooted in Biblical teachings. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and does not align with Christian perspectives on the Israelites, their worship practices, and the significance of the tabernacle in the Old Testament."
