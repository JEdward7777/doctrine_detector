## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle due to several factors.

**1. Completion of Allah's Covenant:**

* The tabernacle was a temporary sanctuary during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness.
* Its purpose was to house the Ark of the Covenant, which symbolized the covenant between Allah and the Israelites.
* Once the Israelites reached their promised land and built the Temple in Jerusalem, the need for a temporary sanctuary vanished.

**2. Transition to a Permanent Temple:**

* The Tabernacle was a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem, which was a permanent place of worship.
* The Israelites believed that the Temple would be a more fitting and enduring dwelling place for the Ark and the presence of Allah.

**3. Symbolic Fulfillment:**

* The Tabernacle was a symbolic representation of Allah's dwelling among his people.
* Once the Temple was built, it became the physical manifestation of that dwelling place.

**4. Fulfillment of Prophecy:**

* The Quran and Islamic tradition both suggest that the Israelites were instructed by Allah to build a permanent temple in Jerusalem as a culmination of their journey.
* This prophecy was fulfilled with the completion of the First Temple.

Grade: 20/100

Comment: The response provided contains several inaccuracies from a Christian worldview. The use of Allah, Quran, and Islamic traditions in relation to the Israelites and their religious practices is not consistent with Christian beliefs. The foundational aspects of the tabernacle, Temple, Ark of the Covenant, and the covenant itself should be rooted in Biblical teachings. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and does not align with Christian perspectives on the Israelites, their worship practices, and the significance of the tabernacle in the Old Testament.
