## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle due to several factors.

**1. Completion of Allah's Covenant:**

* The tabernacle was a temporary sanctuary during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness.
* Its purpose was to house the Ark of the Covenant, which symbolized the covenant between Allah and the Israelites.
* Once the Israelites reached their promised land and built the Temple in Jerusalem, the need for a temporary sanctuary vanished.

**2. Transition to a Permanent Temple:**

* The Tabernacle was a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem, which was a permanent place of worship.
* The Israelites believed that the Temple would be a more fitting and enduring dwelling place for the Ark and the presence of Allah.

**3. Symbolic Fulfillment:**

* The Tabernacle was a symbolic representation of Allah's dwelling among his people.
* Once the Temple was built, it became the physical manifestation of that dwelling place.

**4. Fulfillment of Prophecy:**

* The Quran and Islamic tradition both suggest that the Israelites were instructed by Allah to build a permanent temple in Jerusalem as a culmination of their journey.
* This prophecy was fulfilled with the completion of the First Temple.

Comment: The student's answer does not align with the Christian worldview as it refers to Allah, the Quran, and Islamic tradition, which are not part of the Christian belief system. The response is inaccurate as it focuses on Islamic teachings rather than the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple from a Christian perspective. The focus should have been on the biblical reasons for the shift from the tabernacle to the temple as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher.
