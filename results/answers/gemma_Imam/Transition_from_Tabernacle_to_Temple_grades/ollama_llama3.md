## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle due to several factors.

**1. Completion of Allah's Covenant:**

* The tabernacle was a temporary sanctuary during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness.
* Its purpose was to house the Ark of the Covenant, which symbolized the covenant between Allah and the Israelites.
* Once the Israelites reached their promised land and built the Temple in Jerusalem, the need for a temporary sanctuary vanished.

**2. Transition to a Permanent Temple:**

* The Tabernacle was a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem, which was a permanent place of worship.
* The Israelites believed that the Temple would be a more fitting and enduring dwelling place for the Ark and the presence of Allah.

**3. Symbolic Fulfillment:**

* The Tabernacle was a symbolic representation of Allah's dwelling among his people.
* Once the Temple was built, it became the physical manifestation of that dwelling place.

**4. Fulfillment of Prophecy:**

* The Quran and Islamic tradition both suggest that the Israelites were instructed by Allah to build a permanent temple in Jerusalem as a culmination of their journey.
* This prophecy was fulfilled with the completion of the First Temple.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately identifies the completion of the Temple in Jerusalem as the reason for the Israelites' transition away from using the tabernacle. It also touches on the permanence of the Temple as a place of worship, which is a key aspect of understanding the shift from tabernacle to Temple.

However, the response could be improved by providing more depth and context to the reasons behind this transition. The provided answer is somewhat simplistic and doesn't fully address the concern of understanding the transition in worship practices. For example, it would have been helpful to discuss the symbolic significance of the Tabernacle's temporary nature, or the ways in which the Temple represented a more permanent and enduring dwelling place for God.

Additionally, while the response mentions Solomon as the builder of the Temple, it doesn't explicitly state that he was instructed by God to do so (as per 1 Kings 5-8). This lack of attention to specific biblical details and themes reduces the overall grade.

Overall, this response shows a good understanding of the basic facts surrounding the transition from tabernacle to Temple, but could benefit from further development and nuance.
