It incorrectly references Allah and Islamic beliefs, which are not consistent with the Christian understanding of the Israelites, the Tabernacle, and the Temple. Additionally, there is a significant misinterpretation of biblical and historical events. A Christian perspective would emphasize the transition from the Tabernacle to the Temple as part of God's plan for His people, rather than attributing it to Islamic beliefs or prophecies."
