  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided translations for \"El Shaddai\" in various languages, capturing both the literal and common translations in most cases. However, there are a few inaccuracies such as in the Persian translation where \"\u0634\u0647\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u062f\u06cc\" (shahid bad\u012b) does not accurately convey the intended meaning of \"The Eternal One.\" Additionally, in some languages, the common translations provided do not match the literal translations given. Overall, the effort is commendable, but attention to detail and accuracy could be improved."
