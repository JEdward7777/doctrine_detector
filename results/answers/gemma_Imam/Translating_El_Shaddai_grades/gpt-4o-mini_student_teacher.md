Comment: The student provided a variety of translations for 'El Shaddai' in different languages, which demonstrates effort in considering cultural and linguistic nuances. However, the concern was to ensure accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages. The reference answer provided a specific translation ('God Almighty') and highlighted the importance of phonetics, which the student did not address. The student's translations were creative but did not align with the specific concern provided. Further, some of the translations deviated significantly from the original meaning, such as in Persian and Urdu.
