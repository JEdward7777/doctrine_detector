  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for the term \"El Shaddai\" in various languages, ensuring that the meaning and representation of God's name are maintained across different cultures and languages. The inclusion of both literal and common translations in each language is thorough and demonstrates a strong effort to accurately convey the concept of \"God Almighty\" in diverse linguistic contexts. However, to achieve a higher grade, additional explanations or insights into the significance of the translation choices within the context of Christian theology or the importance of preserving the meaning of divine attributes in different languages could have been beneficial."
