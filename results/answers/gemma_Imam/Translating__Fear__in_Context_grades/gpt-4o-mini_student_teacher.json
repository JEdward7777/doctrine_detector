  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response addressing the different ways 'fear' can be translated when referring to God. They effectively explained the nuances of each translation and highlighted the importance of understanding these nuances for spiritual growth and fulfilling religious obligations. However, the student could have focused more on the specific concern of potential misinterpretation of 'fear' leading to a distorted view of God, tying their explanations back to addressing and mitigating this concern. Strengthening the connection between their explanations and the specified concern would have enhanced the overall coherence and alignment of their answer."
