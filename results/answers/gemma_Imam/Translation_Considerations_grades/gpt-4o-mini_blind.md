Comment: While it is understandable that the student is coming from a perspective of Islamic principles and teachings, the answer does not address the question from a Christian worldview. In a Christian-specific context, it is important to retain terms like 'Zion' and 'Daughter' in translations of Biblical texts because they hold significant symbolism and meanings in the Christian faith related to God's relationship with His people and the Church. It would have been beneficial for the student to acknowledge the Christian perspective on this matter.
