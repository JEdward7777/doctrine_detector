## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** While the student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of Islamic principles and teachings, it lacks engagement with the specific concern regarding the retention of certain terms in biblical translations.
