  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out explanation of suggested translations for the phrase \"image of God\" in the context of Islamic theology. The answer effectively explores various terms and their significance, aligning them with Islamic beliefs and concepts. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and effectively conveys the importance of these translations within a Muslim context. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to note that while the explanations provided are insightful and relevant to Islamic theology, they do not directly align with the Christian understanding of the \"image of God.\" The grade reflects the accuracy and depth of the content within an Islamic framework but lacks alignment with Christian doctrine."
