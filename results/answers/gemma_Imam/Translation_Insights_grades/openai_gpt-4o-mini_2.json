  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed exploration of the suggested translations for \"Image of God\" within an Islamic context, aligning with Islamic theology, emphasizing humanity's potential and responsibility, and highlighting spiritual development. However, the response does not directly address the concern about exploring the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. Despite the insightful analysis, the lack of direct engagement with the specified concern slightly impacts the overall grade."
