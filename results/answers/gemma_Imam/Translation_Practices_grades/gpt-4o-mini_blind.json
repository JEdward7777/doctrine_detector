  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provides a good overview of the different perspectives on translating 'Yahweh' to 'LORD.' However, it lacks a clear doctrinal stance or explanation from a Christian worldview on why this translation choice is made in many Bible versions. Adding a section that explores the theological significance and reverence associated with the name of 'Yahweh' would improve the grade."
