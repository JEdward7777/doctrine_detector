Grade: 65

Comments: The student provides a varied list of alternative translations for "to be zealous" that attempt to reflect its biblical meaning. While the translations themselves are diverse and offer different nuances, the focus on Islamic interpretations at the end seems to distract from the primary aim of the question, which is to explore the biblical meaning of zeal. The student could enhance their response by providing a clearer connection between the alternative translations and their application in biblical contexts. Additionally, the inclusion of only Arabic translations limits the diversity of perspectives that could have been explored.
