  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided alternative translations within a Muslim context, the translations do not align with a Christian interpretation of 'covenant faithfulness.' The translations provided by the teacher, such as 'faithful love,' 'loyal, committed love,' and 'loving dependability,' reflect a deeper understanding of the biblical term from a Christian worldview. The student should focus on providing translations that specifically address the concept of 'covenant faithfulness' within the context of Christianity."
