These translations help broaden the understanding of the term in a different religious context which aligns with the concern of exploring different interpretations of biblical terms. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting these translations to the Christian concept of covenant faithfulness to provide a clearer Christian worldview perspective."
