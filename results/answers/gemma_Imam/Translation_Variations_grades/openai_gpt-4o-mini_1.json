While the translations provided from a Muslim perspective offer valuable insights into the concept of faithfulness and obedience in Islam, the link to deepening understanding of biblical terms is not clearly established. The response could be improved by delving deeper into how these different translations enhance understanding of the Christian concept of 'covenant faithfulness.'"
