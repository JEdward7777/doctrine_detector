  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured explanation of how the translation of 'Lord' differs in Islamic contexts when referring to God versus ordinary people. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the theological significance and nuances of the term \"Lord\" in Islamic terminology. The inclusion of differences in meaning, context, and respect between the two usages is well articulated. However, additional references to specific Islamic scriptures or teachings could further enhance the response's doctrinal correctness."
