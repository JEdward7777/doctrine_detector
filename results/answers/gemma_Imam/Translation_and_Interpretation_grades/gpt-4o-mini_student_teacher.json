They highlighted the theological implications and the differences in meaning and respect associated with the term. However, the student did not directly address the concern about the proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impacting the understanding of scripture and the nature of God from a Christian worldview. To improve, they should have contrasted this with the Christian perspective on the translation of \"Lord\" in relation to God and ordinary people."
