The emphasis on consulting reliable sources for accurate translations is commendable. However, it would have been beneficial to include more explicit connections to the concern about how proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impact the understanding of scripture and the nature of God from a Christian worldview. Overall, the response is thorough and informative."
