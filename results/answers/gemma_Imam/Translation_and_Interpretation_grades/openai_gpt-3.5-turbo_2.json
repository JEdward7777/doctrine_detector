The mention of consulting Islamic scholars for accurate translations is commendable. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms in shaping theological understanding from a Christian worldview. An additional mention of how this impacts the understanding of scripture and the nature of God in relation to the specific concern would have strengthened the response."
