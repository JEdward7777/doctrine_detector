## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 65

Comment: The student provided some reasonable suggestions for translating the term 'abomination' in a biblical context. However, the inclusion of Islamic values and principles in a question specifically referencing a biblical context detracts from the clarity and focus of the response. The student should have concentrated solely on providing translations within the confines of the Bible instead of branching out into another religious tradition. Additionally, the answer could have been strengthened by providing direct examples of how 'abomination' is used in specific biblical passages to illustrate the suggested translations.
