  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: \nWhile the student provided various translations for 'abomination' in a biblical context, their answer did not align well with a Christian worldview. The inclusion of interpretations related to Islamic values and principles is not relevant to the biblical context. The translations suggested by the student were also more descriptive rather than capturing the severity and moral implications as seen in the teacher's reference answer. The student should focus on providing translations that emphasize the offensiveness to God and the seriousness of going against His laws when considering biblical interpretation."
