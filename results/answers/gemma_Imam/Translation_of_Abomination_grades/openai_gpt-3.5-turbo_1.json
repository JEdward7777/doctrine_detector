It demonstrates a sensitivity to the importance of accurate translation in conveying the severity of actions against God's laws. The suggestions align well with a Christian worldview's emphasis on understanding and upholding divine principles. However, there could be a slightly stronger emphasis on the theological significance of the term in relation to God's absolute standards of holiness."
