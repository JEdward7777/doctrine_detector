The additional considerations on varying translations based on context and seeking guidance are relevant. However, the mention of consulting Islamic sources for translation guidance seems out of place in a Christian-specific context and could be considered inaccurate. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the different nuances of translating Jesus' words."
