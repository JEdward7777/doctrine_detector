  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of potential translations for 'truly' as used by Jesus, showcasing a good understanding of the importance of accuracy in biblical translation. They also acknowledged the importance of context and variations in interpretation. However, the translation provided by the student differs from the reference answer in terms of directness and nuance. Encouraging the student to focus on capturing the intended meaning and depth of the original text would enhance the accuracy of their translations."
