## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 40.

While the response attempts to acknowledge the importance of accurate biblical translation, it falls short in several areas. Firstly, it does not provide any concrete translations for the phrase "truly I tell you" as used by Jesus, which is the main concern of the original question. Instead, it offers vague and simplistic alternatives that do not capture the nuances of the original text.

Furthermore, the response fails to demonstrate an understanding of the theological significance of Jesus' words in the biblical context. The suggestion to consult "reliable Islamic sources" is also out of place, as this has no bearing on the translation and interpretation of biblical texts.

To improve this response, it would be necessary to provide more detailed and accurate translations for the given phrase, taking into account the literary style and cultural context of the passage. Additionally, the response should demonstrate a deeper understanding of the theological significance of Jesus' words in the biblical narrative.
