  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful analysis of the term 'ark' within different Biblical contexts. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the various meanings and implications of the term, particularly in relation to Islamic beliefs. The connections drawn between the term 'ark' and its symbolic representations in different contexts are well articulated. However, to improve the grade, the student could enhance the explanation by providing more specific biblical references to support each translation and deepen the doctrinal analysis. Overall, a solid effort with room for further development."
