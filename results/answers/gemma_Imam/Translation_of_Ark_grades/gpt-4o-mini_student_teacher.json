  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the term 'ark' within different Biblical contexts, particularly within an Islamic framework. However, the answer does not fully address the concern of ensuring accurate translation of terms and understanding their contextual meaning as specified. The reference answer provided by the teacher offers a more precise and focused explanation of the term 'ark' in various contexts within the Bible. The student's answer could be improved by including a more in-depth analysis of the specific translations and meanings of 'ark' in the Bible, aligning closer with the concern of accurate interpretation of scripture."
