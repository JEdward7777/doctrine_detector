  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer provides an in-depth explanation of 'begotten' within the context of Islamic theology and spiritual rebirth. However, the concern specifically asked for a Christian perspective, which was not addressed in the response. It is important for students to stay within the parameters of the given concern in order to fully address the question being asked. Thus, the grade is low due to the lack of relevance to the Christian worldview."
