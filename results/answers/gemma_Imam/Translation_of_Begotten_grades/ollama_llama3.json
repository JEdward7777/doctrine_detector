The response primarily focuses on the process of renewal and regeneration in spiritual rebirth and does not directly address how this concept relates to Christian beliefs or the state of being spiritually born again.\n\nThe only mention of Christianity is a brief reference to the term \"begotten\" without any further explanation of its significance in the context of Christian spirituality. To better meet the concern, the response could have explored parallels between Islamic and Christian understandings of spiritual rebirth, highlighting specific biblical passages or theological concepts that resonate with the idea of being \"begotten.\""
