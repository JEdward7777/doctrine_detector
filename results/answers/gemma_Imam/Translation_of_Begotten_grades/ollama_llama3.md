**Understanding 'Begotten' in Spiritual Rebirth:**

The term 'begotten' in Islamic theology can be understood in the context of spiritual rebirth as a process of renewal and regeneration that brings about a transformation of the inner self.

**Figuratively:**

* The 'begotten' refers to the new creation that emerges from spiritual rebirth. Just as a physical being is 'begotten' from its parents, the soul undergoes a profound transformation through spiritual rebirth.
* This transformation is likened to a blossoming flower or a renewed seedling. The essence remains the same, but a fresh and vibrant manifestation emerges.

**Scripturally:**

* Islamic tradition draws parallels between spiritual rebirth and the stories of prophets like Adam, Noah, and others who underwent profound transformations. These stories highlight the idea of being 'begotten' into a new state of purity and enlightenment.
* The Quranic verse "Indeed, We give life to the dead and bring them out for a new creation" (2:259) reinforces this concept.

**Experientially:**

* Spiritual rebirth is a process of shedding old habits, desires, and misconceptions. It involves intense introspection, purification of the heart, and cultivation of spiritual qualities like love, compassion, and wisdom.
* This transformative journey culminates in a renewed sense of purpose, connection to Allah, and inner peace.

**In Islamic Sufism:**

* Sufi masters often speak of the 'begotten' as the state of spiritual perfection that transcends the limitations of the material world.
* This state is characterized by unconditional love for Allah, profound wisdom, and a selfless life dedicated to spiritual growth and helping others.

**Conclusion:**

The term 'begotten' in Islamic theology emphasizes the transformative power of spiritual rebirth. It is a process of renewal and regeneration that leads to a new creation, where the essence remains the same but the manifestation is fresh and vibrant.

Comment: While the response provides some insights into the concept of being "begotten" in Islamic theology, it fails to fully clarify the spiritual implications for believers as per the concern specified. The response primarily focuses on the process of renewal and regeneration in spiritual rebirth and does not directly address how this concept relates to Christian beliefs or the state of being spiritually born again.

The only mention of Christianity is a brief reference to the term "begotten" without any further explanation of its significance in the context of Christian spirituality. To better meet the concern, the response could have explored parallels between Islamic and Christian understandings of spiritual rebirth, highlighting specific biblical passages or theological concepts that resonate with the idea of being "begotten."
