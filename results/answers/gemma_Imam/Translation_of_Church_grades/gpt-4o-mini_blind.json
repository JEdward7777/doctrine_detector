  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided translations for the term \"church\" in a Muslim context, which does not accurately address the question asked. The student should have focused on providing translations with a Christian-specific worldview. The content provided does not align with the Christian perspective and therefore lacks doctrinal correctness. Additionally, the suggestions do not reflect the meaning of \"church\" in a Christian context. The student did include considerations such as context, clarity, and sensitivity, which show some effort in the response. However, the fundamental requirement of aligning with a Christian worldview was not met."
