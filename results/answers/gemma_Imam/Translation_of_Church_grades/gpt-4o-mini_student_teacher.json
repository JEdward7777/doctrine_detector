  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not align with the concern of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature in translations. The suggested translations provided are specific to a Muslim context and do not reflect the inclusive nature of the church that includes all believers, regardless of their background. The translations provided are not relevant to the original question or concern, resulting in a low grade."
