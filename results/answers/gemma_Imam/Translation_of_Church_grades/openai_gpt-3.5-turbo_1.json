However, the concern of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature in translations is not fully addressed. While the translations provided focus on various aspects of Islamic faith and practice, they may not fully capture the inclusivity of the church as a place for all believers. The response could be improved by including translations that specifically highlight the inclusiveness and unity of a diverse congregation, reflecting the universal nature of the church as a community of believers."
