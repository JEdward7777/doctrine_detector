  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 20. \n\nThe student's answer does acknowledge their limitation in providing religious interpretations, which is commendable, but it falls short in addressing the concern about maintaining the accurate meaning of God's titles in Scripture. The student could have acknowledged the significance of proper translation in conveying the essence of 'Lord Yahweh' in different languages, even without delving into specific religious interpretations. Incorporating a suggestion for considering the grammatical structure in the target language, like the reference answer did, would have shown a better understanding of the importance of preserving the meaning across translations. More engagement with the concern in a neutral manner could have improved the response significantly."
