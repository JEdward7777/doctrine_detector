70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of accurate translation and acknowledges the need for consultation with religious experts. However, it could benefit from providing more specific guidance on how to translate the term 'Lord Yahweh' into different languages, rather than simply referring the student to religious scholars.
