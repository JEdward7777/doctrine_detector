  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 60.\n\nWhile the concern emphasizes the importance of conveying the accurate meaning of God's titles and presence in Scripture, the response does not directly address this concern. Instead, it focuses on providing a literal translation of the phrase without considering the theological or biblical context that is crucial for understanding God's nature and presence.\n\nThe response also implies that grammatical structure should be considered in the target language, which is a valid point, but it does not provide any specific insight into how this relates to conveying the accurate meaning of God's titles and presence in Scripture.\n\nTo address the concern more effectively, a stronger response might explore how different translations or interpretations of God's titles and presence can affect our understanding of His character and relationship with humanity."
