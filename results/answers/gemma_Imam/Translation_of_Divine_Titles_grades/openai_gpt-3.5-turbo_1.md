Comment: The response provided offers some assistance by suggesting potential translations for the given term, but falls short in addressing the concern regarding the accuracy of conveying God's titles and presence in Scripture. As a Christian, it is crucial to prioritize the importance of accurately reflecting the essence and significance of God's attributes through translations and interpretations. Encouraging collaboration with religious scholars or authorities is commendable, but a more direct and substantive engagement with the concern would have been more beneficial.
