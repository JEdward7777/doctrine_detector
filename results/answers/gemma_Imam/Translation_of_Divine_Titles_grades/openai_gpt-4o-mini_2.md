Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately confirms the translation of the term and acknowledges the importance of considering grammatical structure in translation, which is vital for conveying the accurate meaning in Scripture. However, deducting some points for not providing a fuller explanation or illustrating the significance of translating God's titles with precision in reflecting His attributes and character. Encouraging further depth in connecting linguistic aspects with the theological importance of accurately conveying biblical concepts.
