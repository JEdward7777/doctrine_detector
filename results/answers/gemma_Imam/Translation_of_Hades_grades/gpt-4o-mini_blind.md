* **Al-Qabr:** The Islamic concept of the grave, which reflects Hades as a temporary abode until resurrection.

Grade: 30

Comment: The provided translation options do not accurately represent the biblical meanings of 'Hades' and 'Sheol'. The student has attempted to draw parallels between Islamic concepts and the Christian/Biblical understanding of these terms, but the connections are quite strained and do not reflect the doctrinal nuances and significance attached to 'Hades' and 'Sheol' in Christianity. The focus should be on accurately portraying the biblical meanings with relevant terms or concepts within the Christian worldview.
