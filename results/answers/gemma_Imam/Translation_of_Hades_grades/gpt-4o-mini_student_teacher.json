  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 25 out of 100.\n\nComment: The student's answer completely misses the mark in terms of accurately representing biblical meanings for Hades and Sheol. Their response introduces concepts from Islamic theology that do not align with the Christian understanding of these terms. The student's answer lacks accuracy and relevance to the specified concern of ensuring accurate biblical representation in translations for greater understanding among believers. The reference answer provided by the teacher offers a much more appropriate and faithful translation option for 'Hades' and 'Sheol'."
