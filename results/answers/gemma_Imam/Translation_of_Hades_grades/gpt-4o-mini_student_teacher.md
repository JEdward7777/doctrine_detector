## [Answer](../Translation_of_Hades.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Hades:**

* **Al-Jannah:** The Islamic concept of paradise, which aligns with Hades as a realm of peace and contentment.
* **Al-Qabr:** The Islamic concept of the grave, which reflects Hades as a temporary abode until resurrection.
* **Al-Ma'ad:** The Day of Judgement, when souls are reunited with their bodies and judged for their actions.

**Sheol:**

* **Al-Firdous:** A lofty paradise described in Islamic tradition, similar to Sheol as a place of ultimate peace and tranquility.
* **Al-Ghayb:** The unseen realm, which aligns with Sheol as a mysterious and unknown destination.
* **Al-Barzakh:** A temporary holding place for souls after death, before the Day of Judgement.

25.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's response as 25 out of 100.

Comment: The student's answer completely misses the mark in terms of accurately representing biblical meanings for Hades and Sheol. Their response introduces concepts from Islamic theology that do not align with the Christian understanding of these terms. The student's answer lacks accuracy and relevance to the specified concern of ensuring accurate biblical representation in translations for greater understanding among believers. The reference answer provided by the teacher offers a much more appropriate and faithful translation option for 'Hades' and 'Sheol'.
