This attempt to blend Christian and Islamic beliefs leads to significant theological inaccuracies and does not accurately represent biblical teachings on the afterlife. The concern of ensuring accurate biblical representation is not addressed at all in this response. Such confusion could lead to serious misunderstandings among believers and misrepresent the core tenets of Christianity."
