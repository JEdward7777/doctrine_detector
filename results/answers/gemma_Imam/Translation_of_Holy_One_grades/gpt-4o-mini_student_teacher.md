## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's response a 85.

The student provided translations in various languages, demonstrating an understanding of the need to accurately represent the term "Holy One" for theological implications. They also acknowledged the importance of respecting linguistic and cultural backgrounds when translating religious terminology. However, the student did not fully focus on retaining the concept of holiness consistently across different languages, which is the specific concern raised by the reference answer from a Christian worldview. Overall, they displayed good knowledge and effort in addressing the question's requirements but could have emphasized the aspect of holiness more consistently in the translations.
