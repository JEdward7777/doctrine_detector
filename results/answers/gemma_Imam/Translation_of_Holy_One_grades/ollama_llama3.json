  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of various language translations for \"Holy One\" and acknowledges the importance of retaining the meaning of holiness in different linguistic contexts. However, it could be improved by providing more specific examples of how the term is translated in each language, rather than just listing the common translations. Additionally, while the response touches on the concern of ensuring accurate representation, it could delve deeper into the theological implications of translation and provide more insight into how to achieve this goal. Overall, a good effort, but room for improvement."
