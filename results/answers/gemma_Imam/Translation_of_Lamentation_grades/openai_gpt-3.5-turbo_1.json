It acknowledges the importance of conveying the weight of sorrow and urgency in lamentation for believers to fully engage emotionally. However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing how Christians specifically can integrate lamentation into their spiritual practices through the lens of their faith and relationship with God. Adding a Christian perspective on the significance of lamentation in light of Jesus' teachings and example would enhance the response further."
