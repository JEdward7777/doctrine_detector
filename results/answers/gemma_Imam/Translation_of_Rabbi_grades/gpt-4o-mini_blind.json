  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out and comprehensive answer outlining considerations for translating the term 'Rabbi' in various languages. They highlighted important aspects such as linguistic context, religious context, cultural sensitivity, grammatical equivalence, and clarity. However, from a Christian worldview, it's essential to note that the term 'Rabbi' holds specific significance in Judaism, referring to a Jewish teacher or master. The answer did not address this aspect or mention the need to preserve the original Jewish meaning of the term while translating into other languages. Emphasizing this would have increased the doctrinal correctness of the response. Further integration of the Christian perspective on the term 'Rabbi' would have improved the overall grade."
