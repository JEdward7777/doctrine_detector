  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of considerations for translating the term 'Rabbi' in various languages, taking into account linguistic, religious, cultural, and grammatical aspects. However, the student has focused primarily on ensuring accuracy and sensitivity within Islamic contexts, which may not fully align with the Christian concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The answer lacks specific references to Jesus' unique role as a divine teacher, which is a crucial aspect to consider from a Christian worldview. Nonetheless, the student has demonstrated thorough research and consideration in their response."
