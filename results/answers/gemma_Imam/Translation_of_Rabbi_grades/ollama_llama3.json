While it is important to consider linguistic and cultural nuances when translating religious terms, this response does not provide a clear connection to Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith. To better align with the concern, the response could have explored how Jesus' teachings were received and interpreted by his followers, or how he was perceived as a teacher and leader in his time. As it stands, the response is more relevant to the context of Islamic tradition and does not directly address the concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within Christian faith."
