Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides some guidance on maintaining the significance of the title 'Rabbi' and considering cultural sensitivities in translation. However, it lacks explicit reference to ensuring the accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith, which is a crucial concern in this context. More direct incorporation of Christian theological principles and beliefs would have strengthened the response.
