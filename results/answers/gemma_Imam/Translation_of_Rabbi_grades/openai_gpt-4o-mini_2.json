However, there is a lack of direct engagement with the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. While the response addresses the need to maintain the religious significance of the term 'Rabbi,' it does not explicitly discuss how the translation should align with Christian beliefs about Jesus as more than just a schoolteacher. Integrating explicit considerations related to representing Jesus accurately within Christian faith would have strengthened the response."
