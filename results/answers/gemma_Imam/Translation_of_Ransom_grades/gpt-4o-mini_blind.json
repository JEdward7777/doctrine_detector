The translations provided seem to accurately convey the essence of a payment made to secure the release of a hostage or to avoid harm. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the Indonesian translation where \"rantai\" is given along with \"ransom\" as the translation. It would have been better if a more direct translation for \"ransom\" was provided for consistency. Additionally, acknowledging the potential variations in translation depending on cultural context is a good addition. Overall, a solid effort in capturing the essence of the term in different languages."
