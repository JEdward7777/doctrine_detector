Comment: The student has provided translations for the term "ransom" in various languages, along with their meanings. The translations provided seem to accurately convey the essence of a payment made to secure the release of a hostage or to avoid harm. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the Indonesian translation where "rantai" is given along with "ransom" as the translation. It would have been better if a more direct translation for "ransom" was provided for consistency. Additionally, acknowledging the potential variations in translation depending on cultural context is a good addition. Overall, a solid effort in capturing the essence of the term in different languages.
