  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 85.\n\nWhile the student did provide translations for the term 'ransom' in various languages and attempted to convey its meaning accurately, they could improve the translations by focusing more on conveying the theological aspect of the term. The translations provided lack the emphasis on the theological significance of 'ransom' as a payment made for redemption or to secure freedom from sin. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the theological implications of the term in different languages would enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of their translations."
