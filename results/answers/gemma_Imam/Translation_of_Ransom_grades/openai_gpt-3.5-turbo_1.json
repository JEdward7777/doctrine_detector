  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough list of translations for \"ransom\" in various languages and accurately conveys the meaning of making a payment to secure freedom. The concern for ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts is addressed well. However, to enhance the grade further, a connection to Christian theology or the concept of ransom in the Bible could have been included to provide a more comprehensive Christian-specific worldview perspective."
