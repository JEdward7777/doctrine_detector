  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer a 70. The student has provided translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, which shows effort and research. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it would have been beneficial for the student to acknowledge the biblical principles of humility and honor, especially when addressing earthly rulers. Additionally, the student could have included a Christian perspective on addressing God as the ultimate Majesty. Overall, while the information provided is useful, there was an opportunity to incorporate a Christian worldview perspective into the answer."
