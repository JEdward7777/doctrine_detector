## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Based on the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations of titles in the context of biblical teachings, the student's answer does not align well with a Christian-specific worldview. The student's translations in Arabic and Indonesian do not directly correspond to the respectful and honorable connotations of titles used in Biblical teachings.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided translations in various languages but did not prioritize accuracy and respectfulness in alignment with Biblical teachings when translating the phrase 'Your Majesty.' The student should consider how these titles are used in a Christian context for future translations.
