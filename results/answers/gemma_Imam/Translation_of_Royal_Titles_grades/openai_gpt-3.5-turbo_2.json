  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for 'Your Majesty' in various languages, which demonstrates a good understanding of the translation options available. The concern for accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings is partially addressed, but it could be strengthened by discussing how translations of royal titles align with biblical principles of respect for authority. Overall, the response is informative and covers a wide range of languages."
