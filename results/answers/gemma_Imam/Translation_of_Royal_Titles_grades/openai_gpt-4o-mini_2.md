Comment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for "Your Majesty" in various languages, which shows a good understanding of linguistic diversity and cultural contexts. However, in the context of biblical teachings, it would be important to emphasize translations that convey respect and honor towards authority figures, in line with biblical principles of honoring rulers and leaders (Romans 13:1). It would have been beneficial to include more specific insights on how these translations align with biblical teachings.
