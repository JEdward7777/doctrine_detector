## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The term "saints" is not commonly used in Islamic tradition or discourse. In Arabic and Islamic contexts, the concept of "saints" does not have an explicit parallel. Muslims traditionally believe in the veneration of prophets and righteous individuals, but not in the cult of saints as understood in other religions.

**Possible translations:**

* **Awliya:** Refers to the righteous individuals who have died and are believed to be intercessors with God.
* **Muqaddas:** Means "holy" or "sacred" and can be used to describe prophets, angels, or other beings deemed worthy of veneration.
* **Mar'iyimun:** Means "righteous" or "virtuous" and describes individuals who exemplify Islamic values and principles.

It's important to consult Islamic scholars and reliable sources for accurate and nuanced understanding of Islamic concepts and terminology.
