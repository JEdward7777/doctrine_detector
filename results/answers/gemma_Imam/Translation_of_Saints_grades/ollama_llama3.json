  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe main issue with this response is that it does not accurately represent Islamic concepts and terminology, which was a key concern. The proposed translations (\"holy ones,\" \"holy people,\" or \"holy believers in Jesus\") are all Christian-centric and do not account for the nuances and specificities of Islamic tradition. Furthermore, the response does not engage with the idea that Muslims have their own understanding of \"saints\" or righteous individuals, as outlined in the original text.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be important to incorporate more accurate information about Islamic concepts and terminology, and to avoid imposing Christian-centric language on Islamic beliefs. The concern for using inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups is also not met in this response."
