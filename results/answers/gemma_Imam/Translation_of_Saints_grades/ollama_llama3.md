## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The term "saints" is not commonly used in Islamic tradition or discourse. In Arabic and Islamic contexts, the concept of "saints" does not have an explicit parallel. Muslims traditionally believe in the veneration of prophets and righteous individuals, but not in the cult of saints as understood in other religions.

**Possible translations:**

* **Awliya:** Refers to the righteous individuals who have died and are believed to be intercessors with God.
* **Muqaddas:** Means "holy" or "sacred" and can be used to describe prophets, angels, or other beings deemed worthy of veneration.
* **Mar'iyimun:** Means "righteous" or "virtuous" and describes individuals who exemplify Islamic values and principles.

It's important to consult Islamic scholars and reliable sources for accurate and nuanced understanding of Islamic concepts and terminology.

20.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 20.

The main issue with this response is that it does not accurately represent Islamic concepts and terminology, which was a key concern. The proposed translations ("holy ones," "holy people," or "holy believers in Jesus") are all Christian-centric and do not account for the nuances and specificities of Islamic tradition. Furthermore, the response does not engage with the idea that Muslims have their own understanding of "saints" or righteous individuals, as outlined in the original text.

To improve this response, it would be important to incorporate more accurate information about Islamic concepts and terminology, and to avoid imposing Christian-centric language on Islamic beliefs. The concern for using inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups is also not met in this response.
