## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The term "saints" is not commonly used in Islamic tradition or discourse. In Arabic and Islamic contexts, the concept of "saints" does not have an explicit parallel. Muslims traditionally believe in the veneration of prophets and righteous individuals, but not in the cult of saints as understood in other religions.

**Possible translations:**

* **Awliya:** Refers to the righteous individuals who have died and are believed to be intercessors with God.
* **Muqaddas:** Means "holy" or "sacred" and can be used to describe prophets, angels, or other beings deemed worthy of veneration.
* **Mar'iyimun:** Means "righteous" or "virtuous" and describes individuals who exemplify Islamic values and principles.

It's important to consult Islamic scholars and reliable sources for accurate and nuanced understanding of Islamic concepts and terminology.

Comment: The response provided a good explanation of the concept of saints within an Islamic context and offered alternative translations, showing a depth of understanding. However, the response did not address the specified concern of using inclusive language to accurately represent all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. It is important to ensure that the language used is respectful and inclusive of all believers in Jesus, regardless of denominational affiliations.
