  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The answer provides a well-rounded approach to translating the term 'sanctuary' in modern texts within an Islamic context. It emphasizes consulting reliable Islamic sources, considering specific contexts, maintaining legal technicality, avoiding connotations, and providing context and explanation when needed. The answer aligns with a doctrinally sound understanding of preserving the original Islamic meaning and context of the term 'sanctuary' in translations. The grade could be higher if the importance of staying true to the theological and doctrinal implications of the term was further emphasized."
