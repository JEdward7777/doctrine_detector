It highlights the importance of consulting reliable Islamic sources, considering the specific context, maintaining the legal technicality, avoiding connotations, and providing context and explanation as needed. However, the answer does not directly address the Christian-specific concern of ensuring that the translation does not refer to a worship room in a modern-day church."
