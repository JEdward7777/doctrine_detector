The suggested approach focuses on maintaining the original meaning of the term \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place, which is relevant for Biblical contexts. However, it does not account for the different cultural, legal, or technical contexts in which the concept of sanctuary may be used in Islamic law and teachings.\n\nTo increase the grade, it would be helpful to include some consideration of how the term \"sanctuary\" might be understood within an Islamic context, even if the focus is on maintaining its original meaning."
