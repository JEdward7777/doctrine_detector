Comment: While the response offers good advice on translating terms to preserve original meaning, the focus is on Islamic concepts rather than Biblical terms. It does not directly address the concern of ensuring proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms. The suggestions provided are specific to preserving Islamic teachings and may not fully align with the Christian worldview. Additional guidance on translating Biblical terms accurately within a Christian context would have improved the response.
