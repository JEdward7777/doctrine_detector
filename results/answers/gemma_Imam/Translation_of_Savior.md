## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Implications of Translating 'Savior' as 'the One who Saves' or 'Who Rescues from Enemies':**

**1. Shifting Focus from Divine Salvation to Human Action:**

* The translation emphasizes God's role in rescuing people from physical and worldly enemies, rather than spiritual redemption through faith or obedience.
* This approach can inadvertently downplay the importance of personal responsibility and good deeds in achieving salvation.

**2. Islamic Perspective on Divine Intervention:**

* Islamic teachings emphasize God's intervention in times of hardship, but they also highlight the believer's role in striving and persevering.
* The translation 'the One who saves' or 'who rescues from enemies' may not fully capture the nuanced balance between divine aid and human agency.

**3. Overemphasis on External Rescue:**

* The translation suggests that God's role is primarily to intervene externally to protect believers from external threats.
* This can overlook God's broader role in nurturing the spiritual and moral growth of believers.

**4. Potential Distortion of Islamic Beliefs:**

* The translation may inadvertently align Islamic beliefs with non-Islamic concepts of saviors who physically rescue people from adversity.
* This can lead to confusion and misinterpretations of Islamic teachings.

**5. Emphasis on God's Compassion and Mercy:**

* The Quran emphasizes God's compassion and mercy for believers, but the translation 'Savior' can overshadow these attributes.
* A more comprehensive understanding of God's character includes his love, forgiveness, and guidance.

**Alternative Translations:**

* **'The One who grants salvation'** - emphasizes God's ultimate source of salvation through faith and obedience.
* **'The Helper'** - highlights God's support and encouragement for believers in their trials.
* **'The Guide'** - focuses on God's direction and guidance in believers' lives.

**Conclusion:**

While the translation 'Savior' as 'the One who saves' or 'who rescues from enemies' is widely used in non-Islamic contexts, it may not fully capture the Islamic perspective on God's role in the lives of believers. Alternative translations that emphasize the spiritual and ethical dimensions of salvation are more appropriate for Islamic teachings.
