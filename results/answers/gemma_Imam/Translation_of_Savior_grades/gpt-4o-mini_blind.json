  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student has provided a well-structured response that explores the implications of translating 'Savior' in an Islamic context. The response acknowledges important points such as the potential shift in focus from divine salvation to human action, the balance between divine aid and human agency, and the emphasis on God's compassion and mercy. However, the analysis could benefit from a more focused exploration of how the specific translation impacts the understanding of God's role in the lives of believers within an Islamic framework. Additionally, the response could have incorporated more direct references to Islamic teachings to support the points made. Overall, a solid effort but room for more depth and specificity in the analysis."
