  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating \"Savior\" as \"the One who saves\" or \"who rescues from enemies.\" It raises important concerns about how this translation may affect theological understanding and faith practices, particularly in an Islamic context. The discussion is well-organized, and the writer effectively uses specific examples to illustrate their points. However, while the response provides a good overview of the potential issues with this translation, it could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting these concerns back to the concern about how language shapes theological understanding and faith practices."
