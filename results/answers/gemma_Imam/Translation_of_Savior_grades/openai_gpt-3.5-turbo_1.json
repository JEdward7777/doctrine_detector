  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively engages with the concern of how language shapes theological understanding and faith practices by considering the implications of translating 'Savior' in different ways within an Islamic context. The analysis is insightful and provides a nuanced perspective on the potential impact of different translations on believers' perceptions of God's role and attributes. The suggested alternative translations offer thoughtful alternatives that align more closely with Islamic teachings. Overall, a well-reasoned and comprehensive evaluation."
