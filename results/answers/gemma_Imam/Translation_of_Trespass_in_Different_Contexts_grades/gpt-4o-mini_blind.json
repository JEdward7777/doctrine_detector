  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating \"trespass\" as \"sin\" or \"breaking the rule\" within a church community. They discuss theological confusion, cultural and contextual differences, legal implications, misunderstanding of boundaries, and emotional reactions. The student also offers alternative translations and recommendations for addressing interpersonal violations. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more specific references to Christian theology and Scripture to support their points, as well as integrating a biblical perspective on forgiveness, reconciliation, and grace in the context of interpersonal conflicts within a church community."
