However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness as it approaches the question from a Muslim perspective rather than a Christian one. In a Christian worldview, the \"House of Yahweh\" specifically refers to the temple or dwelling place of the Judeo-Christian God, Yahweh, and holds theological significance within that context. The answer could have addressed different ways to convey this concept to a modern audience within Christianity, emphasizing its spiritual and symbolic meaning. Additionally, the answer could have highlighted the biblical understanding of the \"House of Yahweh\" as it relates to believers as temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19)."
