  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-researched and insightful exploration of the term \"House of Yahweh\" within a Muslim context, they missed the mark in directly addressing the concern of ensuring accurate translations convey the meaning and importance of worship spaces. The student focused more on the differences between Islamic and biblical terminology, rather than proposing an effective translation that maintains the essence of the original phrase. The student could have improved their answer by suggesting translations that emphasize the significance of Yahweh's presence in the worship space, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
