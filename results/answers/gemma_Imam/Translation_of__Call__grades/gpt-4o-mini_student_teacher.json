  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful alternative translations with a focus on different aspects of calling someone's name in a biblical context, considering nuances in language and interpretation. However, they missed a crucial translation provided in the reference answer given by the teacher, which specifically highlighted a significant meaning related to assigning a name. Despite this oversight, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the complexity of biblical language and its impact on interpretation."
