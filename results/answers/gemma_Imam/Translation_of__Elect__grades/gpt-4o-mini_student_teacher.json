However, the response focuses more on the impact on Islamic interpretations rather than addressing the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God from a Christian worldview. The student could improve by delving deeper into the theological implications within Christianity, such as the concept of predestination and sovereignty of God in the context of being chosen or elected."
