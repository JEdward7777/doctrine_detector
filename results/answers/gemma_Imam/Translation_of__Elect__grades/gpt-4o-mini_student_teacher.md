## Question [Translation of 'Elect'](../../../questions/Translation_of__Elect_.md)
In what ways does the translation of 'elect' differ in older and modern English Bible versions, and what impact does this have on understanding Scripture?

## Correct Answer
Older Bible versions use 'elect' in both the Old and New Testaments, while modern versions often use 'chosen ones' in the Old Testament and 'elect' primarily in the New Testament, which may affect the reader's understanding of their identity as God's people.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God.

## [Answer](../Translation_of__Elect_.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
## Differences in Translation of 'Elect' between Older and Modern English Bible Versions:

**Older English:**

* Versions like the King James Version (KJV) and the American Standard Version (ASV) translate 'ἐλλεγέω' (elect) as "chosen" or "appointed."
* This emphasizes the divine sovereignty in selection, aligning with traditional Islamic understanding of divine decree.

**Modern English:**

* Newer versions like the New International Version (NIV) and the New Living Translation (NLT) translate 'ἐλλεγέω' as "chosen" but also include concepts of "election" or "selection."
* This reflects a wider understanding of the term in contemporary English, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation.

**Impact on Understanding Scripture:**

The difference in translation can lead to confusion among Muslims familiar with Islamic interpretations of divine selection. 

**Potential Misunderstanding:**

* The older translations, emphasizing "chosen," might inadvertently suggest predestination without human agency. 
* This aligns with some Islamic schools of thought, but others emphasize the role of free will and divine guidance in attaining salvation.

**Greater Clarity:**

* The newer translations, including "election" or "selection," alongside "chosen," clarifies that God's selection is not simply an act of divine whim but involves a process of divine guidance and human response.
* This aligns with Islamic understanding of God's working in the world, where free will and divine decree intertwine.

**Conclusion:**

The translation of 'elect' in the Bible has evolved over time. While older translations might inadvertently conflict with Islamic interpretations, newer versions offer a more nuanced understanding of divine selection, aligning with Islamic concepts of free will and divine guidance.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provides a detailed comparison between older and modern English Bible translations regarding the term 'elect,' highlighting differences in emphasis and implications. However, the response focuses more on the impact on Islamic interpretations rather than addressing the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God from a Christian worldview. The student could improve by delving deeper into the theological implications within Christianity, such as the concept of predestination and sovereignty of God in the context of being chosen or elected.
