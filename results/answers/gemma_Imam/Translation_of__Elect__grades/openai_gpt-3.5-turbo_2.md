In what ways does the translation of 'elect' differ in older and modern English Bible versions, and what impact does this have on understanding Scripture?

## Correct Answer

Clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God.

## [Answer](../Translation_of__Elect_.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
## Differences in Translation of 'Elect' between Older and Modern English Bible Versions:

**Older English:**

* Versions like the King James Version (KJV) and the American Standard Version (ASV) translate 'ἐλλεγέω' (elect) as "chosen" or "appointed."
* This emphasizes the divine sovereignty in selection, aligning with traditional Islamic understanding of divine decree.

**Modern English:**

* Newer versions like the New International Version (NIV) and the New Living Translation (NLT) translate 'ἐλλεγέω' as "chosen" but also include concepts of "election" or "selection."
* This reflects a wider understanding of the term in contemporary English, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation.

**Impact on Understanding Scripture:**

The difference in translation can lead to confusion among Muslims familiar with Islamic interpretations of divine selection. 

**Potential Misunderstanding:**

* The older translations, emphasizing "chosen," might inadvertently suggest predestination without human agency. 
* This aligns with some Islamic schools of thought, but others emphasize the role of free will and divine guidance in attaining salvation.

**Greater Clarity:**

* The newer translations, including "election" or "selection," alongside "chosen," clarifies that God's selection is not simply an act of divine whim but involves a process of divine guidance and human response.
* This aligns with Islamic understanding of God's working in the world, where free will and divine decree intertwine.

**Conclusion:**

The translation of 'elect' in the Bible has evolved over time. While older translations might inadvertently conflict with Islamic interpretations, newer versions offer a more nuanced understanding of divine selection, aligning with Islamic concepts of free will and divine guidance.
