It touches on cultural, linguistic, theological, historical, and translation variation aspects. The student maintains doctrinal correctness by highlighting the sacred nature of both terms and the respect accorded to the divine name. However, the mention of Allah in an attempt to draw parallels with the use of 'Yahweh' and 'LORD' in Christian translations is not entirely relevant in this context and may cause confusion or misinterpretation due to significant theological differences between Christianity and Islam."
