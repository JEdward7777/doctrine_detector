However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it would be beneficial to include terms that reflect the biblical significance of 'beloved' within the Christian faith, such as terms like \"beloved of God\" or \"God's beloved.\" This would enhance the interpretation of biblical texts and deepen interpersonal relationships within the Christian community."
