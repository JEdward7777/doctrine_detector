**Distinguishing between a True Prophet of God and a False Prophet:**

**1. Conformity to Islamic Beliefs and Texts:**

* The prophet's teachings must align with the fundamental principles of Islam as outlined in the Quran and Sunnah.
* Any prophet claiming authority beyond these sources should be suspect.


**2. Consistency and Coherence:**

* The prophet's message should be consistent and coherent, offering a logical and cohesive explanation of spiritual concepts.
* Incoherence or contradictions can indicate deception.


**3. Miracles and Signs:**

* The prophet should perform miracles or signs that demonstrate divine power.
* However, reliance solely on miracles can be misleading as false prophets may also perform supernatural feats.


**4. Character and Morality:**

* The prophet must exhibit exemplary character traits such as honesty, humility, and compassion.
* A prophet's actions and teachings should inspire and uplift Muslims.


**5. Fulfillment of prophecies:**

* The prophet's prophecies should be fulfilled with accuracy and precision.
* False prophets often make exaggerated or unrealistic prophecies.


**6. Consensus and Acceptance:**

* The prophet's teachings should be accepted and practiced by the Muslim community as a whole.
* Deviation from established Islamic practices or widespread disbelief suggest potential fraud.


**7. Internal Intuition and Guidance:**

* Muslims should rely on their hearts and intuition to discern between truth and falsehood.
* True prophecies will resonate with spiritual understanding and resonate with the Quran and Sunnah.


**8. Seek Guidance from Scholars:**

* Consult reliable Islamic scholars and leaders who have studied and understood Islamic texts and traditions.
* Seek their guidance in identifying genuine prophets.


**Additional Considerations:**

* The emergence of a prophet is a gradual process, and not a sudden revelation.
* False prophets often emerge during times of political or spiritual unrest.
* Be wary of individuals claiming to be prophets who deviate from Islamic teachings or promote radical ideologies.
