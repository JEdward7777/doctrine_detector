The points mentioned are relevant and cover various aspects such as adherence to Islamic beliefs, consistency in message, character and morality, miracles, prophecies, community acceptance, internal intuition, seeking guidance from scholars, and additional considerations. \n\nFrom a Christian perspective, while some parallels can be drawn in terms of consistency, character, and fulfillment of prophecies, there are significant doctrinal differences between Islam and Christianity on the nature of prophecy, miracles, and the criteria for discerning true prophets. In a Christian worldview, the primary test for a prophet is whether their message aligns with the teachings of Jesus Christ and the apostles as found in the Bible. Emphasis on adherence to the Quran and Sunnah would not apply within a Christian context.\n\nOverall, the answer is well-structured and informative, but it could be improved by incorporating specific references to biblical teachings and the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate standard for discerning prophets in a Christian worldview."
