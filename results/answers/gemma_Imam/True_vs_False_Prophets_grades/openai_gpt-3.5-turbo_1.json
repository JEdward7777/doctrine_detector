However, the response could have further elaborated on specific criteria from a Christian worldview, such as emphasizing the importance of prophecy pointing to Jesus Christ and promoting love, repentance, and reconciliation with God. Additionally, incorporating biblical references to support the points made would have strengthened the argument."
