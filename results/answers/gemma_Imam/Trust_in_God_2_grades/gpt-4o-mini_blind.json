The integration of Quranic teachings regarding Jesus as a prophet for Muslims provides an interesting comparison; however, the response could have further emphasized the unique Christian view of Jesus as divine rather than solely focusing on commonalities. Additionally, connecting more directly to biblical verses would have strengthened the theological foundation of the answer."
