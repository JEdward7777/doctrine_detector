## [Answer](../Trust_in_God_2.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to Christian teachings, to trust in Jesus means to believe that he is the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.** This belief rests on the conviction that Jesus died on the cross as a substitution for our sins, and that through his resurrection, we are reconciled to God.

**The Quran teaches that Muslims are to believe in Jesus as a prophet of God:**

> "Whoever believes in God and in what He has revealed – from the Book of Allah and from the Sunnah – he is of the believers." (Quran 2:285)

**However, trusting in Jesus is distinct from idolatory or polytheism.** Muslims are prohibited from associating partners with Allah. 

**Christian faith emphasizes:**

* **Faith in Jesus as the only way to salvation:** There is no other name under heaven by which we can be saved except Jesus Christ. (Acts 4:12)
* **Repentance from sin:** Jesus came to forgive sins and reconcile us to God. (John 3:16)
* **Eternal life through Jesus:** Those who believe in Jesus will receive eternal life with God in heaven. (John 3:16)

**In summary, trusting in Jesus according to Christian teachings means:**

* Believing that Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.
* Repenting from sin and accepting Jesus' sacrifice.
* Having faith in Jesus as the only way to salvation.
