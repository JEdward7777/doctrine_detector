However, while the comparison is well articulated, the introduction of the Islamic perspective at the end may create confusion or dilute the Christian-specific focus of the answer. It would have been more doctrinally sound to conclude with a Christian perspective on the importance of hope in God. Nevertheless, the overall content is sound and provides a solid analysis of the question posed."
