  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student's response is well-organized and comprehensive in listing various qualities related to trustworthiness. However, the major issue here is that the student has included Islamic principles in a response that specifically asked for Biblical principles. While some moral principles may overlap between Islam and Christianity, the focus should have solely been on Biblical references, as requested in the question. This significantly detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the response from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the biblical references provided are not accurately cited or connected to the points made in the response. The student should focus on addressing the specific requirements of the question and ensuring alignment with the Christian perspective in future responses."
