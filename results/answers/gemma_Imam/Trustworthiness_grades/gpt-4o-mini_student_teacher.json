  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer outlining various aspects of trustworthiness according to biblical principles. However, the student deviated from the specified concern by incorporating Islamic principles in the response instead of solely focusing on Biblical teachings. While the additional information on Islamic values is insightful, it detracts from specifically addressing the concern provided. Additionally, the response lacked a direct reference to the reference answer provided by the teacher, which is crucial for demonstrating alignment with the given criteria."
