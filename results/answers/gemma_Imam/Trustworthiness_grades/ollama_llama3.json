  "grade_comment": "I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the response provided does not align with the specified concern or answer.\n\nThe concern was \"Encouraging followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability,\" but the provided response only defines trustworthiness without providing any specific biblical teachings or principles related to integrity and reliability.\n\nAdditionally, the response appears to incorporate Islamic values and principles, which seems unrelated to the specified concern.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nComment: While the response does touch on the concept of trustworthiness, it fails to provide relevant biblical teachings or principles related to integrity and reliability. Incorporating Islamic values and principles also detracts from the relevance and focus of the original concern."
