However, the question specifically asked for how different forms of love fit into the biblical definition of love, not the Islamic perspective. The response should have focused on interpreting brotherly love and romantic love within a Christian worldview, utilizing biblical passages and teachings. The answer is well-written and organized, but it does not directly address the question asked."
