  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of love within an Islamic context, including love for Allah, brotherly love, and romantic love. However, the student did not effectively address the concern of aligning these different forms of love with a biblical worldview. The response lacks specific references to the Bible or Christian teachings on love, which is essential for discussing how brotherly and romantic love fit into the biblical definition of love. The student's answer strays from the specified concern, resulting in a lower grade."
