**Comment:** 
The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the limitations of the Quranic and Islamic tradition regarding the ultimate antichrist. However, it would benefit from further elaboration on the significance of eschatological figures in Christian theology, particularly in relation to the book of Revelation. The response could also acknowledge the various interpretations of the ultimate antichrist within Christianity.
