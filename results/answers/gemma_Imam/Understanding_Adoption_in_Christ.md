## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to Ephesians 1:5, to be adopted as a child of God means:**

"God loved us and sent his Son to be the atonement for our sins."

This verse highlights two key aspects of adoption as a child of God:

**1. Divine love:** God's love for us is the foundation of adoption. He loved us unconditionally before we even existed.

**2. Redemption through Jesus Christ:** God's love for us is expressed through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ. Through Christ's death and resurrection, our sins are forgiven and we are declared righteous before God.

**In Islamic understanding:**

* The concept of adoption as a child of God resonates with the Islamic belief in taqwa (God-consciousness) and ta'ba (total submission to God).
* Just as an adopted child receives the love and blessings of their adoptive parents, believers are considered children of God through their submission to his will and their faith in his Son, Jesus Christ.

**The Quranic perspective:**

* The Quran emphasizes the special relationship between God and believers: "Say, 'I am only a slave of Allah. I have been given respite for my soul.'" (Surah Al-Ikhlas, verse 13).
* This verse highlights the believer's humble submission to God and their reliance on his mercy.

**In conclusion:**

Being adopted as a child of God in Ephesians 1:5 is a profound spiritual experience that reflects God's unconditional love and redemption through Jesus Christ. This concept resonates with Islamic beliefs and practices, emphasizing the believer's special relationship with God through taqwa and ta'ba.
