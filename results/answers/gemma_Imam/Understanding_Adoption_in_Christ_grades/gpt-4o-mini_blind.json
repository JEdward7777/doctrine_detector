The inclusion of Islamic beliefs and practices in comparison detracts from the doctrinal focus of the explanation. The crucial aspect of adoption being through faith in Jesus Christ as the atonement for sins could have been emphasized more clearly. Additionally, the mention of submission in an Islamic context may cause confusion regarding the distinctiveness of Christian adoption as a child of God through faith in Christ. Overall, more emphasis on the biblical understanding of adoption as revealed in Ephesians 1:5 would have improved the response."
