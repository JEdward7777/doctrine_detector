  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the biblical perspective on adultery as a sin that breaks covenant. However, it lacks specific references or elaboration on the spiritual and relational consequences, as requested in the concern. The response could benefit from additional elaboration on the nature and significance of such consequences within a Christian worldview."
