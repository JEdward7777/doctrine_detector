  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies adultery as a sin in Christian teachings, citing relevant Bible verses to support the claim. The impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality is clearly explained within a Christian worldview. The deduction in the grade is due to the response's primary focus on Islamic teachings rather than fully engaging with the Christian-specific concern."
