  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The answer provides a detailed explanation of the term 'amen' from an Islamic perspective, but it does not address the Christian understanding of 'amen' as requested in the question. The mention of Islamic tradition and the Prophet Muhammad's practice is informative, but it deviates from the focus on a Christian-specific worldview. The grade is low as the response does not align with the Christian context of the question."
