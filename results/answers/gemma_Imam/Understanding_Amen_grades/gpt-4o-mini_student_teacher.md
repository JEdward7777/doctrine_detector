**The term 'amen' signifies completeness, perfection, and acceptance of the prayer.**

In Islamic tradition, 'amen' is an Arabic word that means "so be it" or "thus it is." It is commonly recited at the end of prayers and supplications as a declaration of submission to the will of Allah and an affirmation of the completeness and perfection of the prayer.

The use of 'amen' in Islamic prayers is rooted in the Quran and Sunnah. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have used 'amen' frequently in his prayers and supplications.
