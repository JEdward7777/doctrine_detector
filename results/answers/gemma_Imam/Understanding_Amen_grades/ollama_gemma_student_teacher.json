  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a partial understanding of the significance of 'amen' in Christian practice. While it correctly explains the meaning of 'amen' in Islamic tradition, the response does not address the Christian specific worldview concerning prayer. The connection between the use of 'amen' and the completeness, perfection, and acceptance of prayer in Christian practice could have been elaborated further."
