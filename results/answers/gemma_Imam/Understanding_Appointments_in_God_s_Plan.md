## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
In a Christian context, the concept of being "appointed to eternal life" typically refers to the belief that God has chosen some individuals for salvation and eternal life in heaven. This belief is based on passages such as:

* **"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life."** (John 3:16)
* **"Not everyone who says, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of God."** (Matthew 7:21)

**In Islam, there is no belief in predestination or the concept of being "appointed to eternal life."** Muslim beliefs center around the idea that salvation and eternal life are through following Islamic laws and principles, and through faith in Allah and the Prophet Muhammad.
