However, the comparison with Islam, while informative, could be expanded upon to provide a more nuanced understanding of the differences in beliefs regarding salvation and eternal life. Additionally, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into the theological implications and biblical basis for the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" within Christianity."
