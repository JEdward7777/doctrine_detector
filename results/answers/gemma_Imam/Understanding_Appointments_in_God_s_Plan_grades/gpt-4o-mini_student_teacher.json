  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a clear explanation of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, referencing relevant biblical passages. However, the student's answer lacked depth in exploring the nuanced theological concepts of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation, which could have been further elaborated on in relation to the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, the student's comparison with Islam, while informative, was not entirely relevant to addressing the concern of divine selection in a Christian context."
