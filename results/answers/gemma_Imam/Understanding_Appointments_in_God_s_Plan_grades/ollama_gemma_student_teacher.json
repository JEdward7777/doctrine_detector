  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately explains the biblical concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" as God's selective act of grace in salvation. The reference to relevant scripture and the contrasting of Christian and Islamic beliefs demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological issue. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the nature and extent of God's sovereignty in election, and how it aligns with Christian theology."
