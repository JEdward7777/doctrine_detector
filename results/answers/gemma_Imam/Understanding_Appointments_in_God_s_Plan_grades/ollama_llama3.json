  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately captures the biblical concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" as a reflection of God's sovereign will and grace. It also acknowledges the role of divine selection in salvation, which aligns with the concern of clarifying divine selection and grace in the context of salvation.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response does not explicitly address the contrast between Christian and Islamic beliefs on this topic. The provided passages from John 3:16 and Matthew 7:21 are relevant to the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life,\" but they could have been more fully incorporated into the response to highlight the unique aspects of Christian theology.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a clear and accurate understanding of the concept in a Christian context, it could be strengthened by further exploring the differences between Christian and Islamic beliefs on this topic."
