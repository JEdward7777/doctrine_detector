The connection to divine selection and grace in the context of salvation is clearly and concisely articulated. The incorporation of relevant Bible verses strengthens the Christian perspective. The only minor improvement could be providing a bit more elaboration or interpretation on how divine selection and grace manifest in the concept of eternal life, but overall this response demonstrates a solid understanding from a Christian worldview."
