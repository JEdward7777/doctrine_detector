  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the Christian concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" as being chosen by God through His grace. It aligns well with Christian teachings on divine selection and salvation. The additional information provided on Islamic beliefs also helps to contrast the Christian perspective. Overall, a strong response with a clear Christian worldview."
