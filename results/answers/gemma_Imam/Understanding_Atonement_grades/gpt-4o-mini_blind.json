However, the answer pays too much attention to contrasting Islamic beliefs with Christian beliefs regarding atonement, rather than addressing the significance of Christ's death as the permanent atonement for sin in Christian belief as asked in the question. The response lacks depth and insight into the doctrinal significance and theological implications of Christ's death for atonement in Christianity. A more in-depth exploration and comparison with Christian beliefs would have enhanced the answer."
