The student correctly acknowledges that from a Muslim perspective, Christ's death as atonement is not recognized, but fails to engage with the significance of Christ's sacrifice within Christian belief. The response would benefit from addressing the Christian perspective more directly to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the theological implications of Christ's death for sin atonement."
