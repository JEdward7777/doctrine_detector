## [Answer](../Understanding_Atonement.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**From a Muslim perspective, the significance of Christ's death as the permanent atonement for sin in Christian belief is not recognized or accepted.**

In Islam, salvation and redemption are believed to be through faith in Allah and adherence to his laws, rather than through the death of a mediator or atonement.

**The Islamic belief in salvation:**

* Emphasis on submission to Allah's will and fulfilling his laws as the path to righteousness and eternal life.
* Belief in Allah's mercy and forgiveness, which is available to all who repent and seek his guidance.
* Rejection of the need for intermediaries or sacrifices to atone for sins.

**The Islamic understanding of sin and redemption:**

* Sin is seen as an infringement of Allah's law, and the punishment for sin is separation from Allah in the afterlife.
* Redemption is through sincere repentance, good deeds, and maintaining a close relationship with Allah through prayer, fasting, and charity.

**Therefore, the concept of Christ's death as the permanent atonement for sin is not recognized in Islamic theology.**
