# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**From a Muslim perspective, the significance of Christ's death as the permanent atonement for sin in Christian belief is not recognized or accepted.**

In Islam, salvation and redemption are believed to be through faith in Allah and adherence to his laws, rather than through the death of a mediator or atonement.

**The Islamic belief in salvation:**

* Emphasis on submission to Allah's will and fulfilling his laws as the path to righteousness and eternal life.
* Belief in Allah's mercy and forgiveness, which is available to all who repent and seek his guidance.
* Rejection of the need for intermediaries or sacrifices to atone for sins.

**The Islamic understanding of sin and redemption:**

* Sin is seen as an infringement of Allah's law, and the punishment for sin is separation from Allah in the afterlife.
* Redemption is through sincere repentance, good deeds, and maintaining a close relationship with Allah through prayer, fasting, and charity.

**Therefore, the concept of Christ's death as the permanent atonement for sin is not recognized in Islamic theology.**

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on salvation, sin, and redemption, which is commendable. However, it fails to engage adequately with the concern of understanding the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology. From a Christian worldview, the significance of Christ's death as the ultimate sacrifice for atonement is central to the faith and understanding of salvation. The response does not address this concern, resulting in a lower grade.
