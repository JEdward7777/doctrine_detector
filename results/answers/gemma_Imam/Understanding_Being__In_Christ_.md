- Through his sacrifice, God's love for humanity is restored and the barrier between God and humanity is broken down.

**2. Redemption from Sin:**
- Christ's death and resurrection offer forgiveness of sins and the promise of eternal life with God. 
- Believing in Christ means acknowledging our need for redemption and accepting his sacrifice as the way to forgiveness and reconciliation with God.

**3. Union with Christ:**

- This union involves spiritual growth, transformation, and participation in God's work through Christ.

**4. New Life in Christ:**
- Becoming "in Christ" means receiving a new life characterized by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. 
- These qualities are imparted by the Holy Spirit who lives in believers.

**5. Eternal Life:**
- Christ's resurrection assures believers of their own resurrection and eternal life with God in paradise. 
- This hope sustains and encourages believers in their faith and daily lives.

It's important to note that the concept of "being in Christ" is not limited to any specific rituals or practices.
