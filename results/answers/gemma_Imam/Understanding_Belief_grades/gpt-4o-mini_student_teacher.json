  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the difference between believing in something and believing someone, incorporating Islamic terms and perspectives. While the student's answer covers both intellectual and emotional aspects of belief well, the response could be improved by focusing more directly on the distinction between believing in something and believing someone as it relates to trust in God and others, as outlined in the concern. Additionally, the Islamic perspective provided adds depth to the discussion but could be further aligned with a Christian worldview for this evaluation scenario."
