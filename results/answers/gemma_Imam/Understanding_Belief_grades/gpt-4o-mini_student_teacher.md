**Belief in something:**

* Refers to an intellectual acceptance or conviction of the existence, attributes, or actions of a particular entity.
* It involves understanding and accepting the facts or principles about that entity.
* Belief in something is based on logical reasoning, evidence, and intellectual conviction.


**Belief in someone:**

* Implies a personal trust and faith in the integrity, abilities, or reliability of another person.
* It involves an emotional connection and a willingness to rely on that person's actions or words.
* Belief in someone is based on experiences, observations, and personal qualities.

**In Islamic terms:**

* Belief in something (isti'adhah) is a cognitive act that forms the foundation of faith. It involves accepting the revelations of Allah, the existence of angels, the prophets, and the Day of Judgement.
* Belief in someone (tawakul) is a spiritual act that involves placing trust in Allah's perfectness and mercy. It involves surrendering oneself to Allah's will and seeking guidance from His messengers.

**Both belief in something and belief in someone are essential aspects of Islam:**

* Belief in something strengthens the intellectual foundation of faith.
* Belief in someone fosters a personal connection with Allah and His creation.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the difference between believing in something and believing someone, incorporating Islamic terms and perspectives. While the student's answer covers both intellectual and emotional aspects of belief well, the response could be improved by focusing more directly on the distinction between believing in something and believing someone as it relates to trust in God and others, as outlined in the concern. Additionally, the Islamic perspective provided adds depth to the discussion but could be further aligned with a Christian worldview for this evaluation scenario.
