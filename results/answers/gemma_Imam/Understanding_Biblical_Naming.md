**In the context of biblical naming, the statement 'His name is called John' refers to the assigning of a specific name to an individual at birth or in early childhood.**

The practice of naming in Islam and Christianity shares some similarities. Both religions recognize the significance of names in identifying individuals and connecting them to their families and communities.

**In Islamic tradition:**

* Names are believed to have spiritual and physical significance.
* The Quran and Sunnah provide guidance on naming children, with specific names being recommended or discouraged.
* The name of Allah is considered to be the most beautiful and perfect name.

**In Christianity:**

* The naming of children is seen as a spiritual act with theological and cultural significance.
* The Bible contains numerous examples of naming practices, including the naming of Jesus Christ.
* The names of saints and martyrs are often used as inspirations for new generations.

**Therefore, when the Bible states 'His name is called John,' it simply means that the child was given the name John at birth or during early childhood.**
