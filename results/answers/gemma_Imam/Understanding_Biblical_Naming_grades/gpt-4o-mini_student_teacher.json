  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided information on naming practices in Islam and Christianity, demonstrating some understanding of the significance of names in both religions. However, the actual question was not directly answered. The student did not delve into the specific biblical interpretation or the significance of the statement 'His name is called John' in the Bible. The answer lacked depth and did not directly address the context of the biblical naming as requested."
