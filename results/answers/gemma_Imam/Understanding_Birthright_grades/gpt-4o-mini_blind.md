Comment: 
The answer provides a decent overview of the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob according to Biblical accounts. The points made for both Esau and Jacob are relevant and supported by the story in Genesis. However, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives in the response seems out of place in a context where the question specifically focuses on Biblical accounts. The response could have delved deeper into the theological significance and spiritual lessons directly drawn from the Biblical narrative. Overall, a solid attempt but could have maintained a stronger focus on the Christian worldview.
