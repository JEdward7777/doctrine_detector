  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response outlining the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright for both brothers and included relevant details from biblical accounts. However, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives, though informative, was not required for this specific Christian worldview-focused question. The response could have focused more on analyzing the spiritual consequences within a Christian context as requested in the concern. The student addressed the significance of choices and their consequences but could have delved deeper into the spiritual dimension based on Christian teachings, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
