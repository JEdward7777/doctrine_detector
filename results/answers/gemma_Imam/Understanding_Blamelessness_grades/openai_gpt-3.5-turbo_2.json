However, the concern about the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context was not adequately addressed. From a Christian worldview, being blameless means having a reputation for honoring God, but it also includes being forgiven of sins through faith in Jesus Christ. It would have been beneficial to emphasize the role of Christ's sacrifice in making believers blameless before God in Christianity."
