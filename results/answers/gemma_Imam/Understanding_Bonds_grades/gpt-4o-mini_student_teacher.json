  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while informative about Islamic concepts related to spiritual connections, accountability, and commitment, does not directly address the Biblical concept of 'bonds' as outlined in scripture. The focus on Islamic teachings and practices, while interesting, does not fully align with the Christian worldview and the specific concern provided. The student needed to elaborate more on how the Biblical concept of 'bonds' relates to our spiritual obligations and our relationship with God in light of vows and commitments."
