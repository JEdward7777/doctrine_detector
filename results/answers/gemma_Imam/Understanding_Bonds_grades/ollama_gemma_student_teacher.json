  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of both the Biblical concept of 'bonds' and relevant Islamic concepts. They effectively highlight parallels between Islamic rituals and spiritual practices and the Biblical idea of 'bonds' in the context of spiritual obligations. The response is well-organized, articulate, and demonstrates a comprehensive grasp of the subject matter. However, minor deductions are made for the lack of direct engagement with the specific concern regarding vows and commitments in maintaining a healthy spiritual life."
