  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The student completely missed the mark by interpreting the Biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean' within a Muslim context instead of a Christian one. The answer provided does not align with a Christian worldview and fails to address the significance of moral purity from a Biblical perspective. Additionally, the student's response lacks depth and critical analysis in understanding the spiritual importance of cleanliness. More focus on Christian teachings and principles is needed to improve the grade."
