  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and cohesive analysis of how the Biblical concepts of 'clean' and 'unclean' can be applied to understanding moral purity within a Muslim context. The writer effectively explores the similarities and differences between the two religious perspectives, highlighting the importance of moral purity as a spiritual concept. The conclusion ties the discussion together nicely. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection between the significance of cleanliness in a spiritual context and its practical implications for believers in their personal and communal lives. Overall, this is a well-structured and insightful response."
