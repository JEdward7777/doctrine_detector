However, it could benefit from more emphasis on the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance, as well as a clearer distinction between the temporary consequences of sin and the eternal consequences for those who reject Christ. Additionally, a stronger connection between God's justice and mercy would enhance the explanation of condemnation in light of Christian doctrine."
