  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and insightful analysis of the nature of condemnation as referenced in 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16. They effectively highlighted God's love as overcoming condemnation and emphasized justification through Christ's sacrifice. The student also correctly portrayed sin's consequences, Christ's redemption, and God's forgiveness. However, the student could have more clearly emphasized the contrast between condemnation and grace in the Christian life, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
