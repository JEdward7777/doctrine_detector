  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough interpretation of the verses cited and effectively ties them to the Christian perspective on condemnation and grace. The student successfully addresses the concern by explaining the contrast between condemnation for sin and the grace extended through Christ. The analysis is well-supported with relevant biblical references and reflects a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
