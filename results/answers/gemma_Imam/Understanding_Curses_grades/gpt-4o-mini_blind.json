However, from a Christian worldview, the response should have focused more on the specific teachings of the Bible regarding cursing, the consequences outlined in scriptures, and the emphasis on seeking forgiveness through Christ. While the comparison with Islamic teachings is informative, the Biblical perspective should have been the primary focus with a deeper exploration of the spiritual implications and the need for repentance and reconciliation."
