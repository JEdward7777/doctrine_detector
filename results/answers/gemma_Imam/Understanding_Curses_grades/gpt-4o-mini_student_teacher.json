  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive comparison between Islamic and Biblical perspectives on cursing others, drawing common themes and lessons from both traditions. However, the answer focused more on Islamic teachings rather than solely addressing the Biblical perspective as requested. The mention of shared values and the importance of controlling one's words and seeking reconciliation was insightful. To improve the grade, the student could have delved deeper into the specific spiritual consequences outlined in James 3:10 and explored how this aligns with broader Christian teachings on the power of words."
