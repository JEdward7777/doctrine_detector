**Comment:** While the student's answer correctly points out the discrepancy between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding demons, it lacks elaboration on the Christian understanding of "unclean spirits" as evil or unholy. The response could benefit from further elaboration on the nature of demons as described in Christian teachings and how the concept of "unclean spirits" fits into that framework.
