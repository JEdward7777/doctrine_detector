  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response attempts to address the concern by providing a clear definition of being a disciple of Jesus, linking it to belief, obedience, and following His example. However, the response did not consider the specific context of a Muslim perspective, hence the lower grade. The answer would have been stronger if it integrated how these concepts might be viewed differently or similarly from a Muslim perspective."
