  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComments: The student has provided a thorough and doctrinally sound answer with relevant Bible verses supporting the perspective on God's judgment. They aptly highlighted the distinctions between God's judgment and human judgment, emphasizing God's perfect justice and mercy. The inclusion of an Islamic perspective, while informative, slightly detracts from the focus on a Christian worldview. Additionally, further elaboration on the redemptive aspect of God's judgment and the role of Jesus Christ in salvation would have enhanced the answer."
