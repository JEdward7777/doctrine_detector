  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured answer that addresses the biblical perspective on God's judgment and the differences from human judgment. They have included relevant verses and highlighted key distinctions between the two forms of judgment. Additionally, the student has compared the Christian perspective with an Islamic perspective, showing an understanding of different religious views on the topic. However, the response could be improved by focusing more on the central idea of God's judgment being based on His perfect righteousness and justice, as emphasized in the reference answer."
