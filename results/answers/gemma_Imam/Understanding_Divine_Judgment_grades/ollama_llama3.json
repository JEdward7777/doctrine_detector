  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise biblical perspective on God's judgment, highlighting its basis in God's righteousness and justice. It also correctly contrasts human judgment with God's, emphasizing that human judgment can be flawed and biased. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses adds depth to the discussion.\n\nHowever, I deduct points for the following reasons:\n\n1. Lack of explicit connection between God's judgment and redemption/restoration: While it is implied that God's judgment has a redemptive purpose, this connection could be more explicitly made.\n2. Limited exploration of differences with human judgment: The response could delve deeper into the ways in which God's judgment differs from human judgment, exploring themes like fairness, mercy, and motivation.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively conveys the biblical perspective on God's judgment and its distinction from human judgment. With some further development, it could be even more effective in conveying the concern of understanding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment."
