  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the Biblical perspective on God's judgment, highlighting the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment effectively. The use of relevant Bible verses and the comparison to human judgment further strengthens the argument. The Islamic perspective is briefly touched upon but could have been developed a bit more. Overall, a solid answer from a Christian worldview."
