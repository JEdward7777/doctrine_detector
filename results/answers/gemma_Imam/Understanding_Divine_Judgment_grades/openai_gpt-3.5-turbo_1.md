**Biblical Perspective on God’s Judgment:**

The Bible teaches that God is just and will judge the wicked and sinful. This judgment is not based on human standards but on God's perfect righteousness and holiness.

**Verses on God's Judgment:**

* "For judgment is coming, and the hammer will fall on the wicked" (Revelation 22:12).
* "The Lord is faithful to punish; he is mighty when he convicts the wicked" (2 Timothy 4:1).
* "Whoever rejects the law of the Lord will perish in his rebellion" (Proverbs 29:18).

**Differences from Human Judgment:**

**1. Basis for Judgment:**
- Human judgment is often based on subjective criteria and human laws.
- God's judgment is based on his perfect law, which is eternal and unchanging.

**2. Fairness and Mercy:**
- Human judges may be biased or lenient, but God is perfectly just and merciful.
- He offers forgiveness and redemption through his Son Jesus Christ.

**3. Extent of Judgment:**
- Human judgment is often limited to earthly consequences.
