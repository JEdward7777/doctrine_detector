It effectively communicates that God's judgment is based on His righteousness and justice, contrasting it with the potential biases and limitations of human judgment. Additionally, it includes relevant verses and key points on the topic. The response could have further emphasized the significance of repentance and the call to redemption in God's judgment to strengthen the argument for distinction between the two forms of judgment."
