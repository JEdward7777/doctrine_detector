  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: The student's answer presents a clear and accurate explanation of the concept of eternal life in Christianity, emphasizing that it is a gift from God received through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the student did not address the concern raised regarding how to attain eternal life being essential for spiritual assurance. The student missed the opportunity to emphasize the importance of obedience to God's laws and the significance of faith in inheriting eternal life according to the Christian worldview. This omission significantly impacts the overall grading of the response."
