They accurately explain that eternal life is primarily a gift from God and that faith in Jesus Christ is the only way to receive it. Additionally, the student provides relevant biblical passages to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit statement regarding the importance of obedience to God's laws as a component of inheriting eternal life, as per the reference answer."
