The concept of inheriting eternal life through obeying God's laws is not consistent with Christian teachings, which emphasize that eternal life is a gift from God received through faith in Jesus Christ, not through our own actions. It is crucial to have a correct understanding of this central aspect of Christian faith for spiritual assurance and growth."
