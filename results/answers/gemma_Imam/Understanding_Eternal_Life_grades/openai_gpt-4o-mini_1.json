The correct understanding, as outlined in the first response, is that eternal life is a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ, not through human actions or merit. This misinterpretation significantly undermines the foundational Christian belief in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. It is crucial to have a clear understanding of this concept for spiritual assurance in the Christian faith."
