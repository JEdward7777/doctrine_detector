  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the distinction between 'evil' and 'wickedness' based on biblical teachings, supported by relevant references. The student's inclusion of an Islamic perspective, while interesting, slightly strays away from the focus on a Christian worldview. However, the overall clarity and depth of the response demonstrate a good understanding of the moral implications outlined in the Bible."
