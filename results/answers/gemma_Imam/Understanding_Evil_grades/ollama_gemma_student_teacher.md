## [Answer](../Understanding_Evil.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The Bible's distinction between 'evil' and 'wickedness':**

**1. Evil:**

* Refers to actions or thoughts that are morally wrong and violate God's law.
* Includes intentions, thoughts, words, and deeds.
* Associated with sinfulness and disobedience to God.
* Results in negative consequences for the perpetrator.


**2. Wickedness:**

* Involves deliberate intention to do harm or inflict suffering.
* Characterized by malice, cruelty, and a disregard for others.
* Often associated with deliberate violations of ethical or social norms.
* Results in severe moral and spiritual consequences.


**Biblical references:**

* **Genesis 18:20:** "For I know that you are wicked and stubborn."
* **Psalm 1:1:** "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked."
* **Proverbs 6:32:** "Whoever stirs up strife is wicked."
* **1 John 3:14:** "We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another." (The absence of love is associated with wickedness.)


**Islamic perspective:**

* The Islamic faith shares similar concepts of good and evil with Christianity.
* The Quran and Sunnah emphasize the importance of upholding moral values and avoiding harmful actions.
* Both religions teach that wickedness is a conscious choice that has severe consequences.


**Conclusion:**

The Bible clearly distinguishes between 'evil' and 'wickedness' in terms of moral character and behavior. Wickedness involves deliberate intention to do harm, while evil encompasses a broader range of actions and thoughts that violate God's law.
