  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 60/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the Christian perspective on faith in Jesus Christ. While it is true that the Islamic perspective does not include belief in Jesus as a deity or prophet, the provided answer is irrelevant to the Christian understanding of faith. The reference answer correctly explains that having faith in Jesus in Christianity involves believing in and trusting in Jesus' teachings and sacrifice."
