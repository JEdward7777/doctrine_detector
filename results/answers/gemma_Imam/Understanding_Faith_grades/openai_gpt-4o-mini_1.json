  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response from the student accurately addresses the foundational aspect of faith in Christianity, emphasizing the belief in Jesus and His sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. However, the original response provided for grading is limited by its exclusive focus on Islamic teachings disregarding the Christian perspective on faith in Jesus. This limitation significantly hinders the understanding of the core tenets of Christianity in relation to faith in Jesus, resulting in a low grade."
