## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**The term 'faithless' implies a deliberate rejection of belief in God, thereby incurring Allah's wrath and punishment.**

In Islamic theology, faith (iman) is an essential element of salvation and righteousness. The Quran explicitly warns against disbelief (kufr), which encompasses any deliberate denial or rejection of the existence of Allah.

The Quran states:

> "Whoever disbelieves in Allah - his is a great wrong." (Quran 2:25)

Therefore, being 'faithless' implies an intentional and conscious decision to reject the fundamental belief in the existence of Allah. This rejection carries severe consequences, as Allah's punishment awaits those who disbelieve.

**The consequences of disbelief include:**

* Loss of salvation and eternal punishment in the afterlife
* Allah's displeasure and wrath
* The rejection of spiritual guidance and blessings

**Note:** It is important to be cautious when using the term 'faithless' as it can be offensive and harmful. The Quran emphasizes the importance of respecting all people, regardless of their belief or disbelief.
