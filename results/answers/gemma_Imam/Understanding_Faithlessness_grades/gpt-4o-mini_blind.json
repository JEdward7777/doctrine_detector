The student effectively supports their points with references to the Quran, highlighting the seriousness of rejecting belief in Allah. However, the response could be enhanced by further elaborating on the concept of faith and the importance of seeking guidance. Additionally, the note on being cautious with the term 'faithless' shows awareness of potential sensitivities, which is commendable."
