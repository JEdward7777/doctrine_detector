  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-supported explanation of the term 'faithless' within the context of Islamic theology. They have effectively highlighted the implications of rejecting faith in Allah and the consequences that follow. Additionally, the student's response aligns with the concern of emphasizing the significance of faith in moral conduct. However, the response could further benefit from directly addressing how faithlessness impacts moral conduct, as specified in the concern. Overall, a strong effort with room for slight improvement in connecting faithlessness to moral conduct."
