  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-structured comparison of the concept of fear in the Bible versus common understanding. They effectively highlighted the differences and emphasized the importance of fear as a profound awareness of God's majesty, power, and justice. However, the student could have further emphasized the aspect of worship, respect, and awe towards God, as stated in the reference answer, to align more closely with Christian teachings."
