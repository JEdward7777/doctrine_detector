However, it lacks a detailed exploration of Christian teachings on forgiveness such as the importance of forgiving others as we have been forgiven by God through Jesus Christ. In the context of the concern about understanding the Christian concept of forgiveness, a more in-depth discussion of biblical principles and the significance of forgiveness in Christianity would have improved the response."
