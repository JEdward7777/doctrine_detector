The concept of being "called" by God is central to both Islam and Christianity. While the specific terminology and understanding may differ between the two faiths, the essence remains the same.

**In Christianity:**

* Christians believe that God reaches out to individuals and invites them into a personal relationship with him. 
* This call is seen as a divine election, where God chooses specific people for specific purposes.

**In Islam:**

* The Quran speaks of Allah calling prophets to deliver his message and guiding humanity.

**Common Themes:**

* **Divine Origin:** Both Islam and Christianity affirm that the call to faith originates from God.
* **Specificity:** Both faiths believe that God calls individuals specifically, rather than universally.
