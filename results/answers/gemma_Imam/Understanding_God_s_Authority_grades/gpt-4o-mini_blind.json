However, from a Christian worldview, there are doctrinal differences regarding the nature of God, particularly in terms of the triune Godhead of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The answer does not align with Christian beliefs about the nature and authority of God in our lives. The theological accuracy could be improved by incorporating Christian teachings on God's authority, sovereignty, and majesty as revealed in the Bible."
