  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective, they miss the mark in addressing the question within the context of the Bible and Christian beliefs. The response does not reflect a Christian-specific worldview or understanding of God's calling as portrayed in the Bible. It is important for the student to focus on the doctrinal correctness and theological framework of Christianity when addressing questions related to biblical concepts."
