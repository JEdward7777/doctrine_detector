## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Call.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Islamic context, the concept of God calling individuals by name aligns with Islamic beliefs about divine revelation and the connection between God and His creation.**

**The Quran teaches that God has revealed Himself to humanity through prophets and messengers, and that He calls individuals by name in various contexts:**

* **Personal revelation:** God may call individuals directly through dreams, visions, or other forms of divine communication. 
* **Purification:** God calls believers to repentance and purification, reminding them of their commitment to Him. 
* **Guidance:** God calls people to follow His guidance and walk in His paths. 
* **Accountability:** God calls individuals to account for their actions and to receive their rewards or punishments.

**The Bible's statement "God has called us by name" suggests:**

* **Individual selection:** God has chosen each person specifically for a purpose. 
* **Divine knowledge:** God knows each person intimately and calls them by their unique names. 
* **Eternal relationship:** God's calling is not temporary but is a lasting and eternal relationship.

**In Islamic understanding, this concept resonates with the belief in Allah's knowledge and love for His creation.** Allah's knowledge of individuals is vast and profound, and His calling is an expression of His love and desire to have a close and intimate relationship with His followers.
