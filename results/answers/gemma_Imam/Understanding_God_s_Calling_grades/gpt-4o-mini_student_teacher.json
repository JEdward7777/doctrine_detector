They discussed the concept in both faiths and acknowledged the importance of divine origin and specificity in the call. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the Christian perspective and relating it directly to the understanding of personal purpose within the Christian faith. The response addressed the concern to a good extent but could have been more explicitly linked to the specified concern in the question."
