**In Christianity:**

* The belief in being "called" is often associated with salvation and spiritual growth. 
* Christians believe that God reaches out to individuals and invites them into a personal relationship with him. 
* This call is seen as a divine election, where God chooses specific people for specific purposes.

**In Islam:**

* The concept of "being called" is connected with the idea of prophethood. 
* Muslims believe that prophets are individuals chosen by God to deliver divine messages and guidance to their people. 
* The Quran speaks of Allah calling prophets to deliver his message and guiding humanity.

**Common Themes:**

* **Divine Origin:** Both Islam and Christianity affirm that the call to faith originates from God.
