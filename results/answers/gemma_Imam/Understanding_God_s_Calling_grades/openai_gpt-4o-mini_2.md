**From a Muslim Imam's perspective:**

The concept of being "called" by God is central to both Islam and Christianity. While the specific terminology and understanding may differ between the two faiths, the essence remains the same.

**In Christianity:**

* The belief in being "called" is often associated with salvation and spiritual growth. 
* Christians believe that God reaches out to individuals and invites them into a personal relationship with him. 
* This call is seen as a divine election, where God chooses specific people for specific purposes.

**In Islam:**

* The concept of "being called" is connected with the idea of prophethood. 
* Muslims believe that prophets are individuals chosen by God to deliver divine messages and guidance to their people. 
* The Quran speaks of Allah calling prophets to deliver his message and guiding humanity.

**Common Themes:**

* **Divine Origin:** Both Islam and Christianity affirm that the call to faith originates from God.
* **Specificity:** Both faiths believe that God calls individuals specifically, rather than universally.
* **Purpose:** The call is seen as a means of fulfilling God's plan and guiding people towards spiritual growth.

**Differences:**

* **Nature of Call:** In Christianity, the call is often seen as a spiritual transformation, while in Islam, it is primarily associated with prophethood.
* **Universalism:** Islam emphasizes the universality of the call to faith, while Christianity focuses on the special call of believers.

**Conclusion:**

The concept of being "called" by God is a shared belief between Muslims and Christians, although it may be expressed differently in their respective traditions. Both faiths recognize the divine origin of this call and believe that it is a pivotal moment in spiritual growth and purpose.
