  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer effectively highlights key differences between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the theological implications and contrasts between these two perspectives. The response is well-structured and articulates the importance of aligning with God's will for true glory. However, to enhance the depth of the answer, biblical references supporting each point could have been included for doctrinal clarity. Overall, a strong response with room for minor improvements."
