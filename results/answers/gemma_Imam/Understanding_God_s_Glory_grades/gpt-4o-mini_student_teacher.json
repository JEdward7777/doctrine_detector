  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student effectively outlines the differences between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory in various aspects such as source, nature, motivation, permanence, focus, motivation for action, and relationship to God, they could have included more depth in their explanation and tied it back more explicitly to the concern provided. Additionally, while the student covers a wide range of differences, the answer could benefit from a more concise and focused structure to enhance clarity and coherence. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept but could improve by providing more direct connections to the concern and the reference answer provided by the teacher."
