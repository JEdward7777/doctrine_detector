However, from a Christian worldview, it is essential to clarify that seeking God's will involves aligning our choices with the teachings of Jesus Christ as revealed in the Bible, rather than the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad. While the guidance provided in the response is valuable within an Islamic context, it lacks doctrinal correctness in a Christian context. It is important for the student to distinguish between Islamic beliefs and Christian beliefs when discussing seeking God's will."
