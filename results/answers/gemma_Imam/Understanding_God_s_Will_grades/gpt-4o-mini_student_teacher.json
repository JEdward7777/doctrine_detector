  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured response on seeking God's will in everyday decisions from an Islamic perspective. The answer includes practical steps and examples relevant to the topic, which shows a good understanding of the concept. However, the student's response does not directly address the concern of struggling with decisions that honor God or uncertainty about His direction, which is a significant aspect of the question. To improve the grade, the student could have emphasized more on addressing the concern raised in the prompt while maintaining the Islamic perspective on seeking God's will."
