  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive and accurate explanation of seeking God's will in Islamic tradition.\n* Provides practical steps to apply the concept in daily life.\n* Includes relevant examples illustrating the process.\n* Recognizes the ongoing nature of the journey and encourages persistence.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The answer focuses on Islamic principles, neglecting the Christian perspective on seeking God's will.\n* The connection to the student's concern about uncertainty and honoring God is not explicitly addressed.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:**\n\n* Acknowledge the Christian understanding of seeking God's will, referencing scripture or Christian teachings.\n* Address the concern about feeling uncertain about God's direction by highlighting resources like prayer, scripture study, and seeking guidance from Christian leaders.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and informative response, but it would benefit from incorporating the Christian perspective and explicitly addressing the student's concern."
