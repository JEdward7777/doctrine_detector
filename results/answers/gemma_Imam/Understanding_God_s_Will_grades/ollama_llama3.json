The examples provided are relatable and practical, helping readers understand how to apply these principles in their daily lives.\n\nThe response also aligns well with the given answer, emphasizing the importance of understanding God's desires and plans for our lives and aligning our choices with what is pleasing to Him as revealed in Scripture.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could improve:\n\n1. While the response acknowledges the importance of seeking guidance from Islamic scholars and teachers, it could have delved deeper into the role of scripture (the Quran) in seeking God's will.\n2. The response primarily focuses on the individual's decision-making process, but it would be helpful to explore how these principles can be applied in community and mission settings.\n\nOverall, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding and applying Islamic principles related to seeking God's will, making it an 85 out of 100."
