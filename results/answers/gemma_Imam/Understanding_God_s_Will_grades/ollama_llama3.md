This response effectively addresses the concern by providing a comprehensive guide on seeking God's will in everyday decisions, drawing from Islamic principles and practices. The examples provided are relatable and practical, helping readers understand how to apply these principles in their daily lives.

The response also aligns well with the given answer, emphasizing the importance of understanding God's desires and plans for our lives and aligning our choices with what is pleasing to Him as revealed in Scripture.

However, there are a few areas where the response could improve:

1. While the response acknowledges the importance of seeking guidance from Islamic scholars and teachers, it could have delved deeper into the role of scripture (the Quran) in seeking God's will.
