  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the nature of God's wrath as depicted in the Bible and effectively contrasts it with human anger. The student effectively highlights key characteristics of God's wrath and articulates the differences well. The answer could be enhanced by providing more specific biblical references to support the points made and by delving deeper into the theological implications of God's wrath, particularly in relation to the atonement and the concept of propitiation. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
