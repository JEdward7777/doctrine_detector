* **Justified and righteous:** God's wrath is always based on his justice and is a response to the violation of his laws and principles.
* **Limited in duration:** God's wrath is not eternal but is ultimately directed towards redemption and restoration.
* **Expressive of love:** God's wrath is not a sign of indifference but rather an expression of his deep love for his people.

**1. Motivation:**
