  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized response that aligns closely with the reference answer, demonstrating a solid understanding of the nature of God's wrath as depicted in the Bible. The student effectively highlighted key characteristics of God's wrath and articulated clear differences between God's wrath and human anger. The inclusion of scriptural support could further strengthen the argument and provide a deeper biblical foundation for the explanation. Overall, an excellent response that effectively addresses the concern raised."
