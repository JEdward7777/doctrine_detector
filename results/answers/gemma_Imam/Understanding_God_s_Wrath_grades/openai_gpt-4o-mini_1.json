It correctly portrays God's wrath as a response to sin and rebellion, upholding justice and holiness. The explanation also highlights the importance of understanding that God's wrath is not a fit of rage but a measured response. This response aligns well with a Christian worldview by focusing on God's attributes of justice, holiness, and love. Well done!"
