## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20/100

Comment: The response completely avoids the question and fails to engage with the topic of guilt according to the Bible. It is important to respect the context of the question and attempt to address it within a Christian worldview, even if the respondent's expertise lies elsewhere. Encouraging consultation with Christian scholars or authorities would have been a more appropriate direction to take.
