**Biblical Definition of Heaven:**

The biblical definition of heaven encompasses two primary concepts:

**1. Celestial Residence:**
- Heaven is often described as a realm where God and the righteous reside.
- It is a place of peace, joy, and eternal life with God.
- Examples: Matthew 25:40, Colossians 3:4

**2. Spiritual Condition:**
- Heaven also symbolizes a spiritual state of being in the presence of God.
- It refers to a state of purity, righteousness, and intimacy with God.
- Examples: 1 Corinthians 2:9, Revelation 21:27

**Difference from 'Sky':**

The sky is a physical phenomenon, while heaven is a spiritual concept. While the sky is a temporary and physical abode, heaven is an eternal and spiritual home for the righteous.

**Key Differences:**

- **Nature:** Heaven is a realm beyond physical existence, while the sky is a part of the material world.
- **Accessibility:** Heaven is accessible only to those who are righteous and have accepted God's salvation, while the sky is open to all.
- **Eternality:** Heaven is a permanent and eternal dwelling place, while the sky is temporary and changes over time.
