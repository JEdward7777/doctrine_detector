  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-structured explanation of the biblical definition of 'heaven' and effectively differentiates it from the concept of 'sky'. They incorporate relevant biblical references to support their points and acknowledge the spiritual significance of heaven. The student also makes a distinction between the nature, accessibility, and eternality of heaven compared to the sky. However, a slight deduction in the grade is warranted for not aligning the explanation closely with the teacher's specific reference answer, which highlights that 'heaven' typically refers to where God dwells, while 'sky' pertains to the expanse above the earth. Nonetheless, the student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the differences between 'heaven' and 'sky' from a biblical perspective."
