**Biblical Definition of Heaven:**

The biblical definition of heaven encompasses two primary concepts:

**1. Celestial Residence:**
- Heaven is often described as a realm where God and the righteous reside.
- It is a place of peace, joy, and eternal life with God.
- Examples: Matthew 25:40, Colossians 3:4

**2. Spiritual Condition:**
- Heaven also symbolizes a spiritual state of being in the presence of God.
- It refers to a state of purity, righteousness, and intimacy with God.
- Examples: 1 Corinthians 2:9, Revelation 21:27

**Difference from 'Sky':**

The sky is a physical phenomenon, while heaven is a spiritual concept. While the sky is a temporary and physical abode, heaven is an eternal and spiritual home for the righteous.

**Key Differences:**

- **Nature:** Heaven is a realm beyond physical existence, while the sky is a part of the material world.
- **Accessibility:** Heaven is accessible only to those who are righteous and have accepted God's salvation, while the sky is open to all.
- **Eternality:** Heaven is a permanent and eternal dwelling place, while the sky is temporary and changes over time.

**In Islamic Perspective:**

The Islamic concept of Jannah shares similarities with the biblical concept of heaven, emphasizing eternal bliss, peace, and the presence of God. However, there are differences in the details and beliefs surrounding these concepts.
