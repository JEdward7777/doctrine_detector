The sky is a physical phenomenon, while heaven is a spiritual concept. While the sky is a temporary and physical abode, heaven is an eternal and spiritual home for the righteous.

**Key Differences:**

- **Nature:** Heaven is a realm beyond physical existence, while the sky is a part of the material world.
- **Accessibility:** Heaven is accessible only to those who are righteous and have accepted God's salvation, while the sky is open to all.
