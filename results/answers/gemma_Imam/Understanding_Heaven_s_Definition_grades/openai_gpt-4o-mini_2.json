The comparison between 'heaven' and 'sky' is well-articulated, showing a clear distinction between the two terms from a Christian worldview. The mention of the Islamic perspective adds a comparative element to the discussion. The only minor area for improvement could be to further emphasize the centrality of God's presence in heaven and how it shapes the Christian understanding of eternity and salvation."
