  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and thoughtful response regarding the meaning of God's absolute holiness and its effects on our relationship with Him. They have articulated well the attributes of God's holiness and how it influences our attitudes, actions, and approach towards Him. However, the student did not explicitly address the concern of reflecting on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God as prompted in the question. Therefore, the grade is slightly lower as there was a slight deviation from the specified concern."
