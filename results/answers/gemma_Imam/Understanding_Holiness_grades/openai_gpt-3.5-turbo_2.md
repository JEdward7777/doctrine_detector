Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of God's absolute holiness from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing Allah's perfection and transcendence. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the implications of Allah's holiness on our relationship with Him, focusing on humility, purity, accountability, dependence, spiritual growth, and soul purification. The response intuitively connects the idea of a holy God with the need for personal holiness and seeking forgiveness. The deduction in points is due to the perspective coming from Islamic theology rather than a Christian one.
