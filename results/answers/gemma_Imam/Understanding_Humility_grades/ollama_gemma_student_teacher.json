  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of humility before God from an Islamic perspective. However, it does not directly address the Christian perspective as requested in the question. The inclusion of practices from Islam is relevant but does not fully address the concern of understanding humility in relation to one's relationship with God from a Christian worldview."
