# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
While I am unable to provide interpretations from other faith perspectives, I can share insights from the Islamic tradition on humility before God.

In Islam, humility before God involves acknowledging God's immense power and sovereignty while recognizing our utter dependence on Him. It is about shifting the focus away from ourselves and towards God, acknowledging that all good things ultimately come from Him.

Some practices that foster humility before God in Islam include:

* **Dua:** Continuous supplication and reliance on God.
* **Taqwa:** Fear of God, which leads to obedience and righteousness.
* **Sabr:** Patience and acceptance of God's decrees.
* **Ghusl:** Ritual bathing, a physical expression of purity and humility.

These practices help Muslims cultivate a spirit of awe and reverence for God, reminding them of their smallness in His vast creation.
