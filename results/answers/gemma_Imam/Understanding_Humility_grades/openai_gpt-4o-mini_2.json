The inclusion of specific practices that foster humility, such as dua, taqwa, sabr, and ghusl, further enhances the understanding of humility in relation to one's relationship with God. However, while the response is informative and relevant, it does not directly engage with the Christian perspective on humility before God, which is essential for a holistic evaluation."
