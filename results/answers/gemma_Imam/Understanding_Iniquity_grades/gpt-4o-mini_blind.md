Grade: 20/100

Comment: The student has provided a response that is focused on an Islamic perspective rather than a Christian perspective. The inclusion of references to Allah, the Quran, and the Sunnah deviates significantly from a Christian worldview. The student's answer lacks doctrinal correctness as it misinterprets the concepts of iniquity, sin, and transgression within a Christian context. The student should provide an answer that aligns with Christian beliefs and teachings to receive a higher grade.
