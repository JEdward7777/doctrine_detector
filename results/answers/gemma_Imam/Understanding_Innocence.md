**According to biblical teachings, the term 'innocent' signifies a person who is completely free from guilt or wrongdoing, despite being accused of a crime.**

The Quran and Sunnah teach us that a person is innocent until proven guilty. This principle is also reflected in Islamic legal systems.

**Relevant verses:**

* **Quran 6:53:** "Say, 'I am innocent of that which you associate with me.' I only follow my duty as revealed by God. And my responsibility is only for my own actions."
* **Quran 16:94:** "Say, 'Truth has come from your Lord, and falsehood has vanished away.'"

**The burden of proof lies with the accusers to prove that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.**

**In the context of a wrongfully accused person, the biblical teachings emphasize:**

* The importance of upholding justice and protecting the innocent.
* The need for due process and a fair trial.
* The spiritual significance of innocence, which is associated with purity and reliance on God's justice.

**Biblical stories that illustrate the concept of innocence:**

* The story of Joseph, who was falsely accused of attempting to seduce his master's wife.
* The story of Jesus Christ, who was crucified despite being innocent of any wrongdoing.

**These stories teach us that:**

* False accusations can have devastating consequences, but God is faithful to those who are unjustly accused.
* The ultimate source of justice is God, who will right all wrongs in the end.
