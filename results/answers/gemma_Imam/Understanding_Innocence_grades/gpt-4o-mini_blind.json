  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of innocence in the context of wrongful accusations from an Islamic perspective. However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness by not focusing on the specifically Christian teachings regarding innocence in the face of false accusations. It also incorrectly cites verses from the Quran instead of the Bible. The student could improve by providing a more focused and accurate explanation based on Christian biblical teachings and examples."
