  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-written and informative about Islamic teachings, fails to fully address the Christian worldview as specified in the reference answer. The response does not accurately reflect the biblical perspective on innocence, as it focuses more on Islamic principles rather than the Christian teachings. The references to Quranic verses and Islamic legal systems are not relevant to the question posed from a Christian worldview. The student should have focused on biblical examples and teachings to support their points and address the concerns raised in the question."
