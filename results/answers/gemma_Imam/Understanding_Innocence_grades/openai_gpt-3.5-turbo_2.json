It effectively conveys the importance of upholding justice, protecting the innocent, and relying on God's ultimate justice. The references to the stories of Joseph and Jesus Christ add depth and illustration to the concept of innocence. The response could have further emphasized the role of mercy and forgiveness in the context of innocence, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern in a Christian worldview."
