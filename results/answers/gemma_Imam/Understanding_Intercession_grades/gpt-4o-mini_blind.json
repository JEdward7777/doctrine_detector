  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough comparison of Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding intercession, highlighting similarities and differences. However, the response missed the mark on addressing the specific Christian perspective on the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession. The grade reflects the lack of doctrinal correctness in discussing the topic from a Christian worldview. The student should focus on accurately representing the Christian beliefs and teachings on the role of the Holy Spirit according to biblical principles."
