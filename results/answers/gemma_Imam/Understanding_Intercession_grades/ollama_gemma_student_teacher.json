  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the similarities and differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding intercession. They provide relevant information about the Islamic concept of intercession, including the roles of prayers, supplications, and spiritual leaders. However, the response does not explicitly address the biblical perspective on the Holy Spirit as an intercessor, which is the main concern of the question."
