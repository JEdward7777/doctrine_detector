However, it falls short of deepening the understanding of the Holy Spirit's specific role in prayer and intercession based on a Christian worldview. While it acknowledges the differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs, it could have explored the unique Christian perspective on the Holy Spirit's intercessory role in more depth."
