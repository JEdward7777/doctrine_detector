The response attempts to address the concern by mentioning the concept of angels and spiritual beings in Islamic intercession. However, the explanation could have been more focused on deepening understanding specifically within a Christian context and delving further into the unique role of the Holy Spirit in prayer and intercession as taught in the Bible."
