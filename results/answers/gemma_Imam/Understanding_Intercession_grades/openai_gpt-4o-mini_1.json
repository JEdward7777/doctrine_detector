While it effectively acknowledges the lack of a direct parallel to the Christian belief in the Holy Spirit as an intercessor in Islamic tradition, it fails to fully address the concern of deepening understanding of the Holy Spirit's specific role in prayer and intercession from a Christian perspective. More emphasis on the unique Christian perspective of the Holy Spirit's intercessory work would have been beneficial in addressing the concern raised."
