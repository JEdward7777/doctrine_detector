Grade: 70

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive understanding of acting justly according to Islamic principles, which is commendable. However, the response primarily focuses on Islamic teachings and references, deviating from the given concern of understanding justice according to a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student could have incorporated more direct references to Christian scriptures and teachings on justice, aligning the response more closely with the specified concern.
