  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and detailed explanation of acting justly according to Islamic principles. While the answer is grounded in Islamic teachings rather than a Christian-specific worldview, the overarching concepts of fairness, honesty, and integrity align closely with Christian values. The emphasis on adherence to divine commands, fairness, accountability, social justice, and internal integrity reflects a comprehensive understanding of justice from an Islamic perspective. To improve the grade in a Christian context, incorporating specific biblical references and principles related to fairness and righteousness would have been beneficial."
