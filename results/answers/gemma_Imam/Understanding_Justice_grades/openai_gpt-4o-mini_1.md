Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of acting justly according to Islamic principles, emphasizing adherence to Divine commands, fairness, accountability, social justice, and internal justice. While the response effectively addresses the concept of justice within an Islamic context, there is a deviation from the specified concern of understanding the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness. The inclusion of quotes from the Quran and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad enhances the explanation, but integrating specific references to biblical teachings on justice would further strengthen the response.
