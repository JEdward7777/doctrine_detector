It detailed various aspects such as strengthening faith, seeking forgiveness, releasing emotional burden, seeking solutions, strengthening connection with Allah, enhancing dua, and promoting spiritual growth. The examples of lamentation in Islam further supported the content. However, in addressing the concern about how Christians struggle with expressing sorrows and regrets, the response did not offer insights specific to a Christian worldview. Integration of Christian principles or practices related to lamentation would have improved the response to address the concern more effectively."
