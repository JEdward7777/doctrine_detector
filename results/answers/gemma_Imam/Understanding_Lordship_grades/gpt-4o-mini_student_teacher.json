  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student accurately described the significance of the term 'Lord' in relation to Jesus and God, their answer fell short in explicitly stating that Jesus is God when referred to as 'Lord'. In a Christian worldview, recognizing Jesus as God is fundamental to understanding His divinity and authority. The student provided insightful information about Jesus' lordship over creation, redemption, judgments, and the Church, showcasing a good understanding of the concept. However, the lack of emphasis on the deity of Jesus as 'Lord' lowers the overall grade of the response. It is crucial for the student to align their answer more closely with the Christian belief that Jesus is divine and equal with God the Father."
