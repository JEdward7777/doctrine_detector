They provide relevant biblical references to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from greater clarity and precision in defining the term 'Lord' as it relates to Allah and Christianity. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly stating that the term 'Lord' signifies divine authority and sovereignty when used in reference to Jesus."
