**In the Bible, the term 'Lord' (Lord or Lord God) primarily refers to Allah, the one true God.** It signifies sovereignty, majesty, and dominion over all creation.

**When applied to Jesus, the title 'Lord' acknowledges his lordship over the believers and the Church.** Christians believe Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior, and that he has been given authority and dominion over all things by the Father.

**The Bible teaches that Jesus is Lord over:**

* **Creation:** He is the creator of heaven and earth.
* **Redemption:** He is the one who died on the cross to atone for the sins of humanity.
* **Judgments:** He will judge the living and the dead.
* **The Church:** He is the head of the Church, which is his body on earth.

**The term 'Lord' emphasizes Jesus' divine authority and sovereignty.** It is a title of reverence and submission, acknowledging his rightful place as the supreme ruler and leader of all who believe in him.
