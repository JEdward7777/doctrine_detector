  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-organized explanation of the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character from an Islamic perspective. However, the concern was specifically about understanding God's attributes and His sovereignty over creation. While the answer emphasizes Allah's attributes, sovereignty, and authority, it does not directly address the concept of majesty in relation to God's sovereignty over creation. Additionally, the answer focuses more on the Islamic perspective rather than a Christian worldview, which was the specified concern. Therefore, the grade is lower as the student did not fully address the given concern from a Christian specific worldview."
