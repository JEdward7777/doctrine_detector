The answer effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on how Allah's majesty encompasses various aspects such as divine attributes, perfection, authority, sublimity, grandeur, and mercy. The inclusion of references to Islamic teachings and the practical implications of understanding Allah's majesty further enriches the response. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of God's attributes and His sovereignty within the Islamic worldview."
