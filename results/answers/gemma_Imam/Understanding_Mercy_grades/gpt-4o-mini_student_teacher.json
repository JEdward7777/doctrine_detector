  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of ways to demonstrate mercy in daily life, incorporating aspects of empathy, forgiveness, self-reflection, and acts of kindness. However, the answer lacked a central focus on treating others kindly, offering forgiveness, and helping those in need as exemplified by God's merciful nature. While the student covered various aspects related to mercy, they could have further emphasized the core principles highlighted in the reference answer."
