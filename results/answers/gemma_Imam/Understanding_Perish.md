## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the New Testament, 'perish' in a spiritual sense refers to the separation of the soul from God.** This separation occurs due to the rejection of God's love and forgiveness.

**The Quran teaches that death is merely a separation of the body and soul:**

> "And We shall surely gather them to account." (Quran 2:2)

**However, in the New Testament, 'perish' implies a spiritual consequence of rejecting God:**

> "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

**This separation from God leads to:**

* **Loss of hope:** The promise of eternal life is withdrawn from those who reject God.
* **Eternal separation:** Those who perish will be separated from God forever, facing punishment and condemnation.
* **Spiritual death:** The soul is deprived of the spiritual life that comes from a relationship with God.

**The New Testament teaches that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ:**

> "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast." (Ephesians 2:8)

**Therefore, to 'perish' in a spiritual sense means to reject God's love and forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ.**
