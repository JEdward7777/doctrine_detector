  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a strong explanation of what it means to 'perish' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the separation from God due to rejection and the consequences of this separation. The comparison with the Quranic perspective adds an interesting contrast. However, the student could improve the answer by providing more direct references from the New Testament to support their points and deepen the theological analysis. Additionally, tying in more specific verses related to the concept of perishing would strengthen the overall argument."
