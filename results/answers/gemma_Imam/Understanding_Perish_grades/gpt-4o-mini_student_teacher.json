  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of what it means to 'perish' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament, emphasizing the separation from God due to rejecting His love and forgiveness. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific aspect of being separated from the people of God and the importance of trusting in Jesus for salvation, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student does a good job of exploring the implications of spiritual separation from God, but could have aligned the content more closely with the Christian worldview."
