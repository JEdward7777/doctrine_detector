  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the implications of spiritual separation from God within the Christian worldview, drawing from both the New Testament and the Quran. It effectively addresses the concern by delving into the consequences of rejecting God's love and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The points made are supported by relevant scriptures and offer a comprehensive insight into the theological stance on spiritual perishing. Overall, the response is well-structured, thoughtful, and aligns closely with a Christian-specific worldview."
