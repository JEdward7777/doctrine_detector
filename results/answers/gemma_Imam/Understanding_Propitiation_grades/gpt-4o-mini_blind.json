However, the response lacks depth in explaining the Christian perspective on propitiation and the atoning work of Jesus on the cross. To improve, the student could have provided a more detailed explanation of how Jesus' sacrifice is understood in Christian doctrine as fulfilling the need for propitiation, satisfying the wrath of God, and providing reconciliation between humanity and God. Adding scriptural references and more theological insights would have strengthened the answer."
