However, it could have elaborated more on the Islamic understanding of forgiveness and salvation, which emphasizes obedience to Allah's laws and spiritual growth rather than sacrifice. Additionally, the response does not address the concern of how Jesus' sacrifice relates to God's justice and mercy."
