## Question [Understanding Purification](../../questions/Understanding_Purification.md)
What is the significance of purification in the context of Old Testament laws?

## Target answer from notes
Purification in the Old Testament primarily pertains to cleansing from ritual uncleanness, such as from disease, bodily fluids, or childbirth, as well as from sin through repetitive animal sacrifices.

## Concern to grade by
Understanding how the process of ritual purification reflects Godâ€™s standards for holiness and the nature of sin.

## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The concept of purification does not feature prominently within the Old Testament laws as understood in Islamic tradition. Islamic jurisprudence draws primarily on the Quran and Sunnah, and does not consider the Old Testament laws as binding on Muslims.
