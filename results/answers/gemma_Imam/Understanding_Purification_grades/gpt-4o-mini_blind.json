It focuses on Islamic tradition and does not engage with the Christian worldview. A higher grade would be achieved by explaining the importance of purification in the Old Testament laws in terms of ritual cleanliness, spiritual symbolism, and pointing towards the need for a perfect purification found ultimately in Jesus Christ."
