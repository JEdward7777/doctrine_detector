It demonstrates an understanding of how the process of ritual purification reflects God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin. The only improvement would be to further connect this understanding to the Christian worldview, emphasizing the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice for sin in fulfilling God's standards for holiness."
