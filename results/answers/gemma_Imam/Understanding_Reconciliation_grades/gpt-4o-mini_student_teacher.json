  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on sin and reconciliation, highlighting both similarities and differences. They accurately described the Christian concept of reconciliation through Jesus Christ, even though the answer lacked a direct connection to the biblical reference provided. However, the student could further strengthen their response by incorporating more specific references to biblical scripture and deepening the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
