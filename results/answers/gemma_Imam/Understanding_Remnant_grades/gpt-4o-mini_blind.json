  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComments: The student's response is well-written and organized, but it lacks doctrinal correctness related to the Christian concept of 'remnant.' The answer consistently references Allah and Islamic beliefs instead of God and Christian teachings. The core theological beliefs associated with the Christian idea of 'remnant' including God's faithfulness, the perseverance of believers, purity, hope for restoration, and connection to biblical figures are missing. To improve, the student needs to focus on incorporating Christian perspectives and teachings into their response."
