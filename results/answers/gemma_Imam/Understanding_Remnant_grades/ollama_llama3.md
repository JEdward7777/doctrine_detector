Grade: 60

Comment: The response addresses the concern about understanding the source of strength during difficult times, as it highlights the remnant's perseverance despite adversity. However, the answer could be more specific and detailed in its exploration of the concept of "remnant" and its implications for believers during times of persecution.

The response mostly focuses on general statements about trust in Allah's sovereignty, perseverance, purity, and hope for a future restoration, which are all relevant to understanding the source of strength. However, it does not delve deeper into how the remnant specifically relates to the experience of the Prophet Muhammad or provides concrete examples from Islamic history.

Additionally, some of the points mentioned in the response (e.g., "Allah's Sovereignty") may be more relevant to a discussion about the nature of God rather than the source of strength during difficult times. Overall, while the response touches on the correct concern and offers some relevant insights, it could benefit from further development and specificity to fully address the question.
