It effectively addresses the concern regarding understanding the source of strength during difficult times. However, there is a significant inconsistency in using \"Allah\" (a term for God in Islam) instead of \"God\" (the term used in the provided answer) throughout the response. The perspective presented also lacks a distinct Christian worldview, as it predominantly references Islamic beliefs and the Prophet Muhammad. Integrating more Christian-specific references and language would strengthen the response."
