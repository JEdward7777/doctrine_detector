  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive understanding of Allah's righteousness from an Islamic perspective, focusing on justice, fairness, upholding laws, protecting the weak, purity, cleanliness, trustworthiness, mercy, and compassion. While the answer is detailed and well-structured, it does not directly address the Christian perspective on God's righteousness as provided in the reference answer. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate a comparison or contrast with the Christian understanding of God's righteousness, emphasizing the unique aspects of God's righteousness as described in the Bible."
