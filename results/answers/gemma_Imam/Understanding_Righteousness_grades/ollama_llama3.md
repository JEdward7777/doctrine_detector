## Question [Understanding Righteousness](../../../questions/Understanding_Righteousness.md)
What does it mean for God to be described as 'righteous'?

God's righteousness refers to His absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love, which necessitates the condemnation of sin.

Understanding the nature of God's righteousness is crucial for appreciating His justice and love.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Righteousness.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Allah's righteousness encompasses:**

**1. Justice and Fairness:**
- Allah's justice is eternal and universal, upholding right and punishing wrong.
- He judges people based on their intentions and actions, rewarding the good and punishing the evil.

**2. Upholding His Laws:**
- Allah's laws are perfect and just.
- He created them for our well-being and guides us to what is right.

**3. Protecting the Weak:**
- Allah is the protector of those who are unable to protect themselves.
- He loves those who are humble and righteous.

**4. Purity and Cleanliness:**
- Allah is free from any impurities or defects.
- His attributes are perfect and sublime.

**5. Upholding His Promises:**
- Allah is trustworthy and fulfills His promises.
- His words are like mountains, unmoving and steadfast.

**6. Mercy and Compassion:**
- Allah's righteousness does not negate His mercy and compassion.
- He is eager to forgive those who repent and seek His forgiveness.

**The Quran teaches:**

> "Allah is the Most Just of judges." (Quran 6:10)

> "He is the ruler of justice, the competent judge." (Quran 42:40)

**In Islamic tradition, scholars have elaborated on the concept of Allah's righteousness:**

- Imam Ghazali describes Allah as "the source of all righteousness, the perfection of justice, and the embodiment of all that is good and wholesome."
- Imam Ibn Ata Allah says, "Allah's righteousness encompasses everything that aligns with His nature and attributes, and opposes anything that contradicts them."

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

Here's why:

The response provides some excellent insights into the nature of Allah's righteousness, highlighting aspects such as justice, fairness, protection of the weak, purity, upholding promises, and mercy. It also incorporates relevant Quranic verses and quotes from Islamic scholars like Imam Ghazali and Ibn Ata Allah, which adds depth and authority to the discussion.

However, there are a few areas where the response falls short:

* While it mentions justice and condemnation of sin, it doesn't explicitly connect these concepts to God's righteousness in the same way that the given answer does. This is an important connection to make, as it shows how God's righteousness directly leads to His judgment of sin.
* The response focuses primarily on Allah's attributes and actions, without fully exploring what it means for human beings to experience and respond to God's righteousness.

Overall, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding Allah's righteousness, but could benefit from further development and connection-making between the different aspects of God's character.
