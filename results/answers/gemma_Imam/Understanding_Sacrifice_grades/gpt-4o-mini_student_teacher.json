  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10/100\n\nComment: The student's answer is incorrect as it provides perspectives from Islamic tradition rather than Christian beliefs. The student fails to address the Christian significance of Jesus being referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in relation to the sacrificial system of the Old Testament. The answer lacks a Christian worldview and understanding of the core tenets of Christian faith."
