  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the connection between Jesus being referred to as the 'Lamb of God' and the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. However, the answer does not explicitly address the Christian specific worldview as requested in the concern. The student focuses on Islamic interpretations of Jesus' sacrifice, which is relevant but does not fully address the Christian perspective."
