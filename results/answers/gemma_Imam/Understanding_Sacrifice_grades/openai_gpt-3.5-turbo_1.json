However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the Christian perspective of Jesus as the fulfillment of God's plan for redemption through his sacrificial death on the cross. This explanation may not fully address the concern of helping Christians understand the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role within a Christian worldview."
