# Answer by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus is referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in the Quran and Islamic tradition due to several reasons:**

**1. Fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies:**

* Islamic scholars believe Jesus fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the sacrifice of a lamb for atonement.
* The Quran emphasizes that Jesus' sacrifice is superior to the sacrifices of the past, as it is a sacrifice that eliminates the sins of the entire world.

**2. His sinlessness:**

* Jesus is believed to be sinless, which aligns with the Islamic belief in the purity and innocence of the prophets.
* The term 'Lamb of God' highlights Jesus' willingness to sacrifice himself as a perfect and innocent substitute for the sins of humanity.

**3. His sacrificial death as a display of God's love:**

* Islamic interpretations suggest that Jesus' sacrifice represents God's love for humanity and his willingness to forgive sins through his son's suffering and death.
* This act of sacrifice demonstrates God's immense mercy and compassion.

**4. The importance of redemption:**

* The Quran teaches that Jesus' sacrifice is a redemption from the burden of sin and a way for people to be forgiven and reconciled with God.
* This redemption is offered freely to all who believe in Jesus.

**5. Symbolic connection to the Quran:**

* The term 'Lamb of God' is used in the Quran to symbolize the sacrifice of Jesus, echoing the Islamic tradition of sacrifice during Eid al-Adha.

Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of why Jesus is called the 'Lamb of God' in Islamic tradition, drawing parallels to Jesus' sacrificial role as a perfect and unblemished sacrifice for humanity's sins. However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the Christian perspective of Jesus as the fulfillment of God's plan for redemption through his sacrificial death on the cross. This explanation may not fully address the concern of helping Christians understand the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role within a Christian worldview.
