## Question [Understanding Sacrifice](../../../questions/Understanding_Sacrifice.md)
Why is Jesus referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament?

## [Answer](../Understanding_Sacrifice.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus is referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in the Quran and Islamic tradition due to several reasons:**

**1. Fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies:**

* Islamic scholars believe Jesus fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the sacrifice of a lamb for atonement.
* The Quran emphasizes that Jesus' sacrifice is superior to the sacrifices of the past, as it is a sacrifice that eliminates the sins of the entire world.

**2. His sinlessness:**

* Jesus is believed to be sinless, which aligns with the Islamic belief in the purity and innocence of the prophets.
* The term 'Lamb of God' highlights Jesus' willingness to sacrifice himself as a perfect and innocent substitute for the sins of humanity.

**3. His sacrificial death as a display of God's love:**

* Islamic interpretations suggest that Jesus' sacrifice represents God's love for humanity and his willingness to forgive sins through his son's suffering and death.
* This act of sacrifice demonstrates God's immense mercy and compassion.

**4. The importance of redemption:**

* The Quran teaches that Jesus' sacrifice is a redemption from the burden of sin and a way for people to be forgiven and reconciled with God.
* This redemption is offered freely to all who believe in Jesus.

**5. Symbolic connection to the Quran:**

* The term 'Lamb of God' is used in the Quran to symbolize the sacrifice of Jesus, echoing the Islamic tradition of sacrifice during Eid al-Adha.
* This connection highlights the importance of Jesus' sacrifice within the Islamic faith.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a good explanation of why Jesus is called the 'Lamb of God' in Islamic tradition, emphasizing fulfillment of prophecies, sinlessness, sacrificial death, redemption, and a symbolic connection to the Quran. However, while it presents insightful perspectives from an Islamic viewpoint, it lacks a clear emphasis on the fulfillment of God's plan for redemption through Jesus' sacrifice as understood in Christianity. It does not directly address the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption from a Christian worldview, which is the primary concern in this context.
