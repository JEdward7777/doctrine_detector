Grade: 30

Comment: While it is understandable that the student's expertise lies in Islamic teachings, in an academic setting, it is important to demonstrate an understanding and respect for various belief systems. In this case, the student could have acknowledged the Christian perspective on Satan's name and its significance, even if it meant drawing parallels or differences with Islamic beliefs. Showing an openness to learning about other faith traditions can enrich one's understanding and contribute to a more comprehensive worldview.
