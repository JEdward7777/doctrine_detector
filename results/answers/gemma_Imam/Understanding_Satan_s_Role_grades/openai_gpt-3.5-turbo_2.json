  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided a correct and relevant explanation of the name 'Satan' within a Christian context, showcasing an understanding of its significance in Christian theology. However, the examiner's self-imposed limitation on providing interpretations or insights related to Christian beliefs is a major concern as it restricts the ability to fully engage with the Christian-specific concern presented. The response could have been greatly enhanced if the examiner had shared further insights or reflections from an Islamic perspective, demonstrating a comparative understanding of the topic."
