  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the meaning of the Hebrew term 'Shaddai' and its significance in the Old Testament context. The examples given are relevant and support the explanation well. However, mentioning the term's significance in the Islamic context was not necessary for answering the question, as it is out of the scope of the inquiry about the Hebrew term within the Old Testament. Therefore, a slightly lower grade is given for going off-topic."
