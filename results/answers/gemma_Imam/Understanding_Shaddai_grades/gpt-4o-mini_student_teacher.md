Grade: 50

Comment: The student provided a well-structured and detailed explanation of the term 'Shaddai' and its usage in the Old Testament. However, the student's answer does not align with Christian theology, which emphasizes 'Shaddai' as a name for God meaning 'the Almighty.' The explanation of 'Shaddai' as meaning 'faithful' or 'trustworthy' is not accurate from a Christian perspective. Additionally, the mention of the significance of 'shaddai' in the Islamic context is not relevant to the question asked, which focused on understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture.
