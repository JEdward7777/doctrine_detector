  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a well-detailed explanation of the meaning, usage, and examples of the term 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament, showcasing a good understanding of how the term is used in a biblical context. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture, which was the specified concern. Incorporating more explicitly how the term 'Shaddai' as the Almighty reflects God's power, sovereignty, and faithfulness could enhance the grade in relation to the concern provided."
