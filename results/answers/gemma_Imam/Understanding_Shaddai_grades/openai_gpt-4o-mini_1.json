However, the response does not directly address the concern regarding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. The mention of God's faithfulness and reliability is significant, but a more direct connection to God's almighty nature and character as revealed in the Hebrew term 'Shaddai' would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
