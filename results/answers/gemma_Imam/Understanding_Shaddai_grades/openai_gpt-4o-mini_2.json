However, the response does not directly address the concern of understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. It would have been beneficial to discuss how the term 'Shaddai' reflects God's omnipotence and sovereignty, aligning with a Christian worldview that emphasizes God's power and authority."
