Comments: 
While the student's response demonstrates effort in formulating strategies used by Jesus to resist temptations, there are significant theological inaccuracies present. First and foremost, the mention of Jesus reciting the Quran is factually incorrect as Jesus did not recite the Quran, which is a text from Islamic theology. From a Christian perspective, Jesus would have relied on the Old Testament scriptures and his own teachings, not the Quran. Additionally, the response fails to recognize Jesus's reliance on the Word of God, fasting, prayer, and his identity as the Son of God as central components of his resistance to temptation. In a Christian worldview, accuracy in depicting Jesus' actions and teachings is paramount for a correct understanding of his strategies against temptation.
