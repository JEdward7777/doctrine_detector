## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's answer a 50.

While the student provides various strategies that Jesus may have used to resist temptations, their answer lacks a crucial focus on Jesus's use of scripture and His unwavering faith in God, as emphasized in the reference answer from the teacher. The student's response includes references to recitation of Quran, dependence on Allah, avoidance and distance, humility and modesty, fasting and prayer, recalling Allah's promises, use of scripture, and seeking support. While some of these points may align with Christian values and practices to resist temptation, the core aspect of Jesus's reliance on scripture and faith in God is missing. 

It's important for the student to align their response more closely with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the central role of scripture and faith in overcoming temptations, especially when discussing Jesus's example.
