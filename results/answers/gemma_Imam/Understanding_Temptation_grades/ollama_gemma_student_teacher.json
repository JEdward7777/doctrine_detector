However, it lacks specificity in referencing Christian principles and scriptures. The answer would benefit from further elaboration on how Jesus' faith in God and reliance on scripture were central to his resistance to temptation. Additionally, the student's mention of the Quran could be clarified as potentially misleading as Jesus primarily relied on the Bible (Scripture) rather than the Quran to resist temptation."
