  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 30.\n\nWhile the response does mention Jesus using scripture to resist Satan's temptations, it doesn't provide any specific examples or strategies that are applicable to daily life as a follower of Christ. The response also fails to address the concern of understanding how to combat temptation in daily life by not providing any practical advice or biblical principles that can be applied.\n\nThe majority of the response focuses on Jesus' encounter with Satan, which is not directly relevant to the question's concern about daily life. Additionally, there is no clear connection made between Jesus' actions and their applicability to Christian living.\n\nTo improve this response, it would need to provide more specific examples or strategies that are grounded in Scripture and can be applied to daily life as a follower of Christ."
