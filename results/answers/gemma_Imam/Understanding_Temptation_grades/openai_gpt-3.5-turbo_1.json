The emphasis on scripture and faith in God is central to combating temptation, as highlighted in the given answer and addresses the concern of applying these principles in daily life as a follower of Christ. The response could have been further enhanced by explicitly connecting each strategy to the teachings of Jesus in the Bible, but overall, it effectively captures the essence of combating temptation from a Christian perspective."
