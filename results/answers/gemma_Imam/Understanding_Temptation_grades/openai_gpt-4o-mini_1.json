The strategies listed align well with biblical teachings and offer practical insights for combatting temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. The only minor deduction is for including recitation of the Quran, which is not a practice attributed to Jesus in Christian beliefs. Overall, this is a strong and insightful analysis that effectively addresses the concern raised."
