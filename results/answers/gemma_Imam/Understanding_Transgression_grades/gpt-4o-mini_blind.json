  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The answer provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'transgress' in both Biblical and Islamic contexts. However, the inclusion of Islamic teachings and examples without sufficient focus on the actual Biblical perspective could lead to confusion or dilution of the Christian-specific worldview. To improve the grade, the response should prioritize and expand on Biblical references and teachings regarding transgression while minimizing information from other religious traditions."
