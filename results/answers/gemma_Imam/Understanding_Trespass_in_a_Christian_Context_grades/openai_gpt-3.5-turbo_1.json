It effectively addresses the concern by explaining the connection between interpersonal violations and sin against God within the context of Christian ethics. The comparison with Islam adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could be strengthened by elaborating further on the redemptive aspect of trespasses against God and how forgiveness through Christ plays a role in Christian theology."
