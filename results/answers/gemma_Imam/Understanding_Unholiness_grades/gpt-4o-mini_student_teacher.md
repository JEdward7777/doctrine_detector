Grade: 75

Comment: The student has provided a thorough list of characteristics of an 'Unholy' life and has attempted to identify them in actions and society from an Islamic perspective. However, there is room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with the Christian worldview concern provided, which focuses on rebellion against God and dishonoring Him. Encouraging more explicit references to the importance of honoring and glorifying God in all aspects of life would strengthen the Christian perspective of the answer.
