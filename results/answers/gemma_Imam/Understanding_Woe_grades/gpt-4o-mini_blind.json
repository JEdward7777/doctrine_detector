In a Christian perspective, 'woe' signifies more than just a divine warning; it also reflects God's righteous judgment and the consequences of sin. The response should focus solely on the Christian interpretation of 'woe' within the Bible without blending it with Islamic perspectives. Additionally, more theological depth and scriptural references could enhance the explanation."
