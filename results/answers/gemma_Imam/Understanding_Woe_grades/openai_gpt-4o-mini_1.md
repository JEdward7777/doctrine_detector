Comment: While the response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term 'woe' in both biblical and Islamic contexts, it does not directly address the concern of understanding biblical warnings related to sin and judgment. The response should focus more on how the concept of 'woe' in the Bible reflects God's justice and the consequences of sin rather than comparing it to Islamic teachings.
