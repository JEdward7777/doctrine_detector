  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a decent explanation of the term 'woe' within biblical context and how it signifies distress and impending judgment for sin. However, the majority of the response focuses on the Islamic perspective of 'woe' rather than deeply analyzing the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment. To improve the grade, the response should have delved more into the biblical warnings and judgments specifically, rather than primarily discussing the Islamic perspective."
