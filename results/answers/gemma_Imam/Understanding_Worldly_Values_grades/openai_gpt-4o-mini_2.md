## [Answer](../Understanding_Worldly_Values.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
The term "worldly" in Christian teachings carries the meaning of being focused on the material and earthly things of this life rather than spiritual or heavenly matters. In other words, worldly people prioritize things like wealth, possessions, physical pleasures, and social status.

**Christian teachings suggest that worldly behaviors and values include:**

* **Greed and materialism:** Excessive desire for material possessions and wealth.
* **Sensuality and pleasure-seeking:** Emphasis on physical enjoyment and indulgence.
* **Vanity and self-centeredness:** Focus on personal achievements, status, and recognition.
* **Lust and immorality:** Engaging in sexual activities outside of marriage or upholding traditional moral values.
* **Worldliness often implies a neglect of spiritual pursuits such as prayer, fasting, and devotion to God.**

**Christian teachings encourage believers to live a life that transcends the worldly pursuits and focuses on spiritual values such as:**

* **Humility and contentment:** Accepting what God provides and prioritizing spiritual growth over material possessions.
* **Obedience to God's laws:** Following God's commands and living a life that pleases him.
* **Compassion and service to others:** Showing love and care for those in need.
* **Focus on eternity:** Investing in spiritual growth and preparing for life after death.
