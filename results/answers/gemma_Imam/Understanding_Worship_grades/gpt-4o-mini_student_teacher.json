  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of worship in Islam, detailing its various forms, purposes, and characteristics. However, the concern specified the importance of understanding worship in a Christian's life. While the student's answer is informative and well-structured, it does not directly address the Christian worldview of worship as outlined in the reference answer. Therefore, the grade reflects the lack of alignment with the Christian perspective on worship."
