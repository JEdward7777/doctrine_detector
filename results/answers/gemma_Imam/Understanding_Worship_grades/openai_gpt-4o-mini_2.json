While the explanation is thorough and insightful, the concern specified from a Christian worldview is not directly addressed. In a Christian perspective, worship is not only about honor, praise, and obedience but also about acknowledging Jesus Christ as the Savior and Mediator between God and humanity. Integrating this aspect would have improved the alignment with the Christian concern provided."
