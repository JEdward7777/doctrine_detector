## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 95

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by explaining the figurative expression "Daughter of Zion" in the context of God's relationship with His people, specifically Israel. The language used is respectful and free from harmful stereotypes or offensive terminology. While it would be even more effective if the response explicitly connected this metaphor to its implications for understanding God's relationship with His people (the concern), the overall response demonstrates a good grasp of biblical symbolism and a commitment to using language that is respectful and sensitive to all people.
