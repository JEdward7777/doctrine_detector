  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the metaphorical language used in Scripture, specifically the term 'Daughter of Zion,' and highlights the significance of God's affection and care for His people. It aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the deeper spiritual implications of such language. The deductive points are minimal given the respectful and appropriate language used throughout the response."
