  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a decent overview of Sheol and Hades in the biblical context and attempted to touch on the differentiation between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous. However, the student's response lacks depth and specificity in comparing the afterlife destinies of the righteous and unrighteous in Sheol and Hades, as the teacher's reference answer clearly points out the evolution of beliefs over time. More detailed exploration and analysis would have improved the response."
