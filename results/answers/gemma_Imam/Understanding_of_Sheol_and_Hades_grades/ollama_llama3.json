  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the biblical context of Sheol and Hades, noting that they initially represented a neutral place for all the dead to await judgment. It also correctly highlights the distinction between the righteous and unrighteous in the New Testament, with Hades being associated primarily with the unrighteous and 'Abraham's side' or 'paradise' representing the fate of the righteous.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more detail on how these concepts developed over time within biblical literature. Additionally, while it mentions the distinction between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous, it could delve deeper into the theological and philosophical implications of this distinction.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical context of Sheol and Hades, but could benefit from further development and analysis."
