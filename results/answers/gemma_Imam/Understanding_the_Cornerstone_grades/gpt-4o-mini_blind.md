## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Cornerstone.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus Christ does not play any role as the cornerstone in the context of the Assembly of believers according to Islamic beliefs.**

The cornerstone of the Islamic faith is the belief in Allah (God) and Muhammad (peace be upon them). The Assembly of believers (Ummah) is founded on the teachings of Islam and the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad.

Comment: The answer provided lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective. In Christian belief, Jesus Christ is often referred to as the "cornerstone" based on verses such as Ephesians 2:20 which states, "Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone." It is important to understand and accurately reflect the beliefs of the particular religious context being asked about.
