Jesus Christ serves as the foundational support for the Assembly, determining its strength and stability.

## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Cornerstone.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus Christ does not play any role as the cornerstone in the context of the Assembly of believers according to Islamic beliefs.**

The cornerstone of the Islamic faith is the belief in Allah (God) and Muhammad (peace be upon them). The Assembly of believers (Ummah) is founded on the teachings of Islam and the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad.
