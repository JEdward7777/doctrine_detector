## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Cornerstone.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Jesus Christ does not play any role as the cornerstone in the context of the Assembly of believers according to Islamic beliefs.**

The cornerstone of the Islamic faith is the belief in Allah (God) and Muhammad (peace be upon them). The Assembly of believers (Ummah) is founded on the teachings of Islam and the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad.

Comment: The provided response does not align with a Christian worldview as it fails to acknowledge the central role of Jesus Christ as the cornerstone of the Church. Understanding and affirming Christ's significance in the church is crucial for a believer's faith and community involvement within a Christian context. It is important to recognize and affirm the unique role of Jesus Christ in shaping the beliefs and practices of the Christian Assembly.
