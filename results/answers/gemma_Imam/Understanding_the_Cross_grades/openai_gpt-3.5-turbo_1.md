Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively acknowledges the core Christian belief regarding Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and its significance for salvation. The concern is directly addressed from a Christian worldview, attributing the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins and the promise of eternal life to Jesus' death on the cross. The only slight deduction is due to the initial disclaimer from the Muslim Imam, which, while understandable, detracts slightly from complete alignment with the Christian perspective.
