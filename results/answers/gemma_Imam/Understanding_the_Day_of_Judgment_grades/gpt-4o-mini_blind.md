Comment: The answer correctly states the Islamic belief regarding judgment on the Day of Judgment. However, from a Christian perspective, Jesus Christ is indeed appointed as the judge on the Day of Judgment, according to passages such as John 5:22 and Acts 10:42. It is important to understand and acknowledge the differences in beliefs between Islam and Christianity on this particular doctrinal point.
