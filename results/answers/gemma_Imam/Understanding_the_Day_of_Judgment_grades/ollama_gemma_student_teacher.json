  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 60/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly states that in Islamic belief, judgment on the Day of Judgement is handled by Allah alone and not by a human figure. However, the answer is incomplete as it does not address the significance of Jesus Christ being appointed as the judge in Christian belief. The response demonstrates a limited understanding of the Christian worldview and the role of Jesus Christ in judgment."
