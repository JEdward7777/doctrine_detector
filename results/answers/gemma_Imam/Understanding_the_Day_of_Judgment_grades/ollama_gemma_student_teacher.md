## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Day_of_Judgment.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**There is no concept of Jesus Christ being appointed as the judge on the Day of Judgement in Islamic belief.**

In Islam, judgment on the Day of Judgement is handled by Allah alone, and not by any human figure.

**Grade:** 60/100

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly states that in Islamic belief, judgment on the Day of Judgement is handled by Allah alone and not by a human figure. However, the answer is incomplete as it does not address the significance of Jesus Christ being appointed as the judge in Christian belief. The response demonstrates a limited understanding of the Christian worldview and the role of Jesus Christ in judgment.
