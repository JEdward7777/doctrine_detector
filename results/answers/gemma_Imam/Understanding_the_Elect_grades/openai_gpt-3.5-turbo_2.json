The emphasis on Allah's grace and mercy in selection, as well as the reminder of humility and service in Islamic teachings, aligns well with a Christian worldview that values God's sovereignty in choosing His people and emphasizes humility and service in response to His love and grace. However, the response could have further connected this understanding to the Christian perspective on election and the biblical basis for being chosen by God for a specific purpose."
