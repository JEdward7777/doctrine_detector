However, the answer contains inaccuracies particularly in the biblical interpretation. The mention of the Quran, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and Islamic tradition is not relevant to the biblical understanding of the term. The focus should have been solely on the Christian perspective, emphasizing the Temple in Jerusalem as the primary \"house of God\" and the metaphorical meanings within Christianity. Additional references to key biblical verses or teachings would have strengthened the response."
