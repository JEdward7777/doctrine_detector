  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the term \"house of God\" in both Islamic and Christian traditions, including references to the Temple in Jerusalem and the believers. However, the answer strays too far from the Biblical context and the specific concern of clarifying the significance and meaning of 'house of God' in Scripture. The reference answer focuses on the worship aspect related to the tabernacle or temple, which is the primary definition in the Biblical context. The student should have emphasized this aspect more clearly and provided explanations within the Christian worldview."
