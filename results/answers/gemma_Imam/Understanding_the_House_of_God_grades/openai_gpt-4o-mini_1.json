  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"house of God\" in both biblical and Islamic contexts, highlighting the connection to the physical Temple, the community of believers, and the broader metaphorical meanings. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the significance and meaning of 'house of God' in Scripture beyond just being a place of worship. The reference to the Quran and Islamic tradition adds depth to the comparison between the Christian and Islamic perspectives. However, the response could have further elaborated on the theological significance and spiritual implications of the term within a Christian worldview to strengthen the analysis."
