  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed response addressing various characteristics that reflect the image of God according to the biblical definition, but the answer includes references to the Quran instead of focusing on a Christian specific worldview. The student did not directly mention key characteristics such as the ability to feel emotion, reason, communicate, and have an eternal spirit, as outlined in the reference answer. It is important to ensure the answer aligns closely with the Christian perspective to fully address the question from a biblical standpoint."
