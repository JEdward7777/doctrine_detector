  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a very general and limited explanation of how human characteristics reflect the image of God, focusing solely on emotions, reason, communication, and the eternal spirit. The answer did not expand on the broader implications or significance of being created in God's image, such as creativity, compassion, justice, responsibility, sociality, integrity, and morality as detailed in the biblical definition. The lack of depth and specificity in addressing this important theological concept led to a low grade."
