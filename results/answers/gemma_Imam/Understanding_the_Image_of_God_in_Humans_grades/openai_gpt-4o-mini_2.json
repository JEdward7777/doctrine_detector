However, the answer lacks depth and a specific reference to the biblical perspective on being created in the image of God. It would have been stronger if it directly connected these characteristics to the biblical concept of the image of God, as outlined in Genesis 1:27. The response also includes references from the Quran which may not align with a Christian-specific worldview. There is room for improvement in providing a more focused and in-depth explanation from a Christian perspective."
