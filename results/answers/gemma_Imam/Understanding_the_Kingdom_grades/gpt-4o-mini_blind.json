However, the Christian perspective is not fully accurate according to Christian doctrine. The Kingdom of God in the New Testament is more than just God's reign over hearts and minds; it also includes the eschatological fulfillment of God's rule over all creation. The student could improve the accuracy by exploring biblical references such as Matthew 6:10 and Revelation 11:15. Additionally, the Islamic perspective could be more detailed and supported by references from Islamic sources."
