  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While the response provides a detailed overview of Islamic beliefs concerning the 'last days' and the first and second comings of Jesus (Isa), it deviates significantly from a Christian specific worldview. In a Christian context, the 'last days' pertain to the period leading up to the second coming of Jesus Christ, not Isa. The answer also lacks any Christian doctrinal perspective or references to scripture, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of this topic from a Christian viewpoint. Additionally, the description of events and signs of the 'last days' does not align with Christian teachings. To improve, the student should focus on accurately representing Christian beliefs and incorporating relevant biblical references."
