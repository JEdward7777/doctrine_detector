  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10/100\n\nComment: The student's answer is incorrect as it focuses on Islamic tradition and beliefs regarding the 'last days,' which deviates significantly from the Christian perspective. The answer does not address the timeline of major Biblical events related to Jesus' first and second comings as required in the question. It is crucial for the student to understand and provide an explanation based on the Christian worldview to answer the question effectively."
