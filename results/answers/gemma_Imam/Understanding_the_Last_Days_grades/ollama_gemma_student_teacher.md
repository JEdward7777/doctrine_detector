**The 'last days' in relation to Jesus' first and second comings:**

In Islamic tradition, the 'last days' refer to a period of significant upheaval and spiritual transformation preceding the Day of Judgement and the return of Jesus (Isa). This period is characterized by:

**First Coming:**

* Increased spiritual awareness and knowledge of Allah's word.
* Widespread corruption and moral decay.
* Rise of false prophets and leaders.
* Distortions of Islamic beliefs and practices.

**Second Coming:**

* The emergence of a righteous Muslim leader known as the Mahdi.
* The invasion of Jerusalem by Muslim forces.
* Jesus' descent from heaven with a troop of angels.
* The resurrection of the believers and the destruction of the unbelievers.

**Signs of the 'last days':**

Islamic tradition mentions various signs indicating the approach of the 'last days,' including:

* Increased earthquakes and natural disasters.
* Widespread poverty and inequality.
* Extreme weather conditions.
* The rise of nationalism and tribalism.
* The decline of religious values and practices.

**The importance of spiritual preparation:**

The 'last days' highlight the urgency of spiritual preparation and adherence to Islamic values. Muslims are encouraged to:

* Strengthen their faith and knowledge of Islamic doctrine.
* Perform acts of worship and charity.
* Engage in acts of kindness and compassion.
* Prepare for the inevitable.

**It is important to note:**

* The specific timing and sequence of events are not explicitly foretold in Islamic tradition.
* The 'last days' are not solely defined by external events but also by internal spiritual transformation.
* Muslims believe in the imminent return of Jesus (Isa) as a source of hope and comfort.
