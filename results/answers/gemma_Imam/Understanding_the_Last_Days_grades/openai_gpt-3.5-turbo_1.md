Islamic tradition mentions various signs indicating the approach of the 'last days,' including:

* Increased earthquakes and natural disasters.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided deviates significantly from the Christian perspective by presenting viewpoints and beliefs from Islamic tradition regarding the 'last days' and the events surrounding Jesus' first and second comings. While the information given may be accurate within an Islamic context, it does not align with the specific concern of understanding the Biblical timeline and its impact on Christian faith. In a Christian worldview, the focus would be on Biblical events, prophecies, and teachings related to the 'last days,' rather than interpretations from other religions.
