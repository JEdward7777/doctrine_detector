  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer correctly mentions the personal and covenantal nature of God, but incorrectly refers to God as \"Allah\" instead of \"Yahweh,\" which is the specific name used in the Old Testament. Additionally, the student does not mention God's eternal and self-existent nature, which is a significant aspect of the name 'Yahweh' in the Christian worldview. Overall, the student demonstrates some understanding but lacks accuracy in key details."
