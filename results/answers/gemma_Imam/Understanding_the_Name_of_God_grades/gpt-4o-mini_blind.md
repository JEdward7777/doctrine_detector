**The significance of the name 'Yahweh' in the Old Testament is not recognized or accepted within Islamic beliefs.**

In Islam, we believe in Allah as the one true God and the source of all creation. The Old Testament is considered to be a revelation from Allah, but it is not considered to be authoritative or binding on Muslims.
