  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer correctly explains that the name 'Yahweh' is not recognized or accepted within Islamic beliefs. However, it could have elaborated more on the significance of the name within Judaism and its relevance to understanding God's personal nature and relationship with humanity. The response lacks an exploration of the connection between the name 'Yahweh' and the concept of God's existence and presence, as suggested in the reference answer."
