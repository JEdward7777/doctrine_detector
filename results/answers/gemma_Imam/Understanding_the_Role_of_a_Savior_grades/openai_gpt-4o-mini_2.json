The inclusion of the implications for Muslims and emphasizing the importance of understanding Christ's role in Christianity adds depth to the response. The only minor improvement could be further elaboration on how the Old Testament judges foreshadow the eternal salvation provided by Jesus Christ in order to fully address the concern of grasping the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation."
