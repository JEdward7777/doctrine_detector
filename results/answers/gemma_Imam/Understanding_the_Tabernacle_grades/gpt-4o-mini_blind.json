However, there are significant theological inaccuracies in the use of the term \"Allah,\" which is not the God worshiped by the Israelites but rather a term used in Islam. The explanation should have referred to the God of Israel or YHWH instead. Additionally, the response lacks emphasis on the tabernacle as a symbol of God's presence among His people and the importance of sacrificial atonement. A more thorough integration of these doctrinal aspects would have improved the overall theological accuracy and depth of the response."
