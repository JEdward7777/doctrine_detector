However, the student's response falls short in articulating the central role of worshiping the God of Israel as the primary purpose of the tabernacle. The mention of worshiping Allah instead of the God of Israel is a significant deviation from the biblical perspective. Additionally, the focus on the symbolism related to the Promised Land lacks emphasis on the core purpose of the tabernacle in facilitating the Israelites' relationship with God through worship and obedience."
