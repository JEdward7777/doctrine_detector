  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: The answer provided by the student is incorrect from a Christian worldview. The explanation focuses solely on an Islamic perspective of Jesus as a prophet, missing the crucial Christian understanding of Jesus as both fully human and fully divine. The student inaccurately equates the title 'Son of Man' solely with Jesus' humanity and humility, neglecting its deeper theological significance in referencing Jesus as the Messianic figure prophesied in the Old Testament, emphasizing his role as the Savior and the divine Son of God. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to address the Christian understanding of Jesus' identity adequately."
