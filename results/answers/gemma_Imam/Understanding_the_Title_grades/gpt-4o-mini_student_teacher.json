The student did not address Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is essential to understanding the significance of His self-identification as the 'Son of Man' in Christianity. In a Christian context, it is crucial to highlight Jesus' unique position as the Messiah who bridges the gap between God and humanity through His human incarnation and divine nature."
