Grade: 40

Comment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus as the 'Son of Man' and its implications for faith, the answer strayed from the Christian specific worldview. The student did not address Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is essential to understanding the significance of His self-identification as the 'Son of Man' in Christianity. In a Christian context, it is crucial to highlight Jesus' unique position as the Messiah who bridges the gap between God and humanity through His human incarnation and divine nature.
