  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides an insightful exploration of the Islamic perspective on Jesus as the 'Son of Man' title, highlighting his human qualities, humility, and role as a compassionate figure. However, the Christian-specific worldview, focusing on Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, is not addressed adequately. The grading reflects the depth of analysis within an Islamic perspective but lacks the integration of a Christian viewpoint on the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' for faith."
