However, it did not address the Christian understanding of Jesus as fully human and fully divine, which is crucial in grasping the significance of His self-identification as the 'Son of Man' within the Christian faith. The perspective provided was informative but lacked the Christian-specific viewpoint necessary to fully address the concern raised."
