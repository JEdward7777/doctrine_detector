Comment: The response provided valuable insights from an Islamic perspective on the title 'Son of Man', emphasizing Jesus' humanity and his connection to ordinary people. However, it did not address the Christian understanding of Jesus as fully human and fully divine, which is crucial in grasping the significance of His self-identification as the 'Son of Man' within the Christian faith. The perspective provided was informative but lacked the Christian-specific viewpoint necessary to fully address the concern raised.
