However, the response fell short in addressing the Christian perspective on how God can exist as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit while being one God. It focused more on comparing Islam and Christianity in terms of monotheism, lacking a deep explanation rooted in Christian doctrinal teachings on the Trinity. It would be beneficial for the student to delve deeper into Christian theological concepts in future responses."
