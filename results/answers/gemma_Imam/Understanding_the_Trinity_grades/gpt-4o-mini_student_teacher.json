Instead, they focused on explaining the differences between Islamic beliefs and Christian beliefs without delving into the specific Christian understanding of the Trinity. The response lacked a Christian perspective on how God exists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit while being one God, which is a crucial aspect of the question."
