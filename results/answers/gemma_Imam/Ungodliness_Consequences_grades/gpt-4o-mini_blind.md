Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides a detailed explanation of consequences for ungodly people according to Islamic teachings. However, the question specifically asked for consequences according to Christian beliefs, not Islamic teachings. The response should have focused on Christian doctrine and biblical teachings regarding the consequences for ungodly people. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, but the answer is not aligned with the Christian worldview, hence the lower grade.
