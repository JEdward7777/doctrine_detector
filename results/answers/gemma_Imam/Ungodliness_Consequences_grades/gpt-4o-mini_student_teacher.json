  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-organized explanation of the consequences for ungodly people according to Islamic teachings. However, the concern specifically asked for an answer from a Christian worldview. The student did not address the Christian perspective on the consequences of living in disobedience to God. It is important for the student to focus on providing a response that aligns with the specified concern in order to receive a higher grade."
