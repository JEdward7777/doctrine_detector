* He inflicts sickness, hardship, and poverty as punishments.
* He allows worldly misfortunes to test and purify believers.

**2. Punishment in the afterlife:**

* The Quran describes hell as a place of punishment and torment for disbelievers and wrongdoers.
* The severity of punishment is based on the extent of one's disbelief and evil deeds.
* Unbelievers will face:
    * Endless suffering and punishment.
    * Separation from loved ones.
    * The loss of all worldly possessions.

    * Ignore or reject His messages.
    * Commit sins and disobey His laws.
    * Treat others with cruelty or injustice.

**4. Loss of rewards:**

* Ungodly people forfeit these rewards and are condemned to eternal punishment.

**5. God's justice:**

* God is perfectly just and will hold everyone accountable for their actions.
* Everyone will be judged according to their deeds and intentions.

**The Quran emphasizes:**

* The importance of fearing God and obeying His laws.
