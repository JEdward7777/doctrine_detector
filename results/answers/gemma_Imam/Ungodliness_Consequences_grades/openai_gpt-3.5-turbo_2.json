The focus on God's punishment being proportionate to the offense committed and the emphasis on repentance and faith in God's mercy align well with the concern of spiritual ramifications. Additionally, the inclusion of God's mercy and forgiveness for those who repent and believe showcases a balanced perspective. Integration of a Christian worldview might involve highlighting Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice who offers redemption and salvation through faith in Him."
