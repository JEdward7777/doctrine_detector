**In the Old Testament:**

* In the prophets' stories, God is often described as the "Holy One."

**In the New Testament:**

* The term "Holy One" is primarily used to refer to Jesus Christ. 
* This title emphasizes Jesus' divine nature and his separation from sin. 
* Examples of this usage can be found in the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, and other New Testament writings.

**Islamic perspectives:**

* The concept of the "Holy One" in Christianity aligns with the Islamic belief in Allah as the one and only God (Monotheism).
* Muslims believe that Jesus is a prophet of God, but they do not consider him to be divine or the Son of God.
