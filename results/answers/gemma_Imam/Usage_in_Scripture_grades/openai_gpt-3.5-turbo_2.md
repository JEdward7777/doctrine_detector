## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the Old Testament:**

* The term "Holy One" is used to refer to God in the Psalms (22:3), Isaiah (48:13), and other passages.
* In the prophets' stories, God is often described as the "Holy One."

**In the New Testament:**

* The term "Holy One" is primarily used to refer to Jesus Christ. 
* This title emphasizes Jesus' divine nature and his separation from sin. 
* Examples of this usage can be found in the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, and other New Testament writings.

**Islamic perspectives:**

* The concept of the "Holy One" in Christianity aligns with the Islamic belief in Allah as the one and only God (Monotheism).
* Muslims believe that Jesus is a prophet of God, but they do not consider him to be divine or the Son of God.

Comment: The response effectively highlights the use of the term "Holy One" in both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing its significance in referring to God in the Old Testament and Jesus Christ in the New Testament. It addresses the concern by emphasizing that in the New Testament, the term specifically points to Jesus as the "Holy One," highlighting his divine nature and separation from sin. The response could have delved deeper into specific passages or teachings that explicitly demonstrate Jesus' authority and divinity as presented in the New Testament to further strengthen the argument.
