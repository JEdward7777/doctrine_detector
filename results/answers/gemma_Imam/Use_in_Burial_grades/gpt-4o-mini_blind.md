Comment: The response provides a basic understanding of how myrrh was used in burial practices in biblical times. However, it lacks depth and fails to mention the specific biblical references and significance of myrrh in Christianity. Additionally, it may be misleading to state that the use of myrrh in burial was not exclusive to any particular faith or ethnicity, as the biblical accounts primarily focus on its use in the context of Jesus's burial. More clarity and specificity would enhance the answer.
