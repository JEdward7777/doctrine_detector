However, the answer could be strengthened by emphasizing the significance of myrrh in the anointing process and the respect given to the deceased, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, connecting the use of myrrh to specific biblical references or examples would further enhance the understanding of its cultural and religious significance in scripture."
