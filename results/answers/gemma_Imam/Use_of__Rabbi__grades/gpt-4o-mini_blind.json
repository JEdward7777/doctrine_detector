In Christian tradition, Jesus is indeed referred to as \"Rabbi\" multiple times in the New Testament, highlighting His authority and role as a teacher. However, John the Baptist is not typically referred to as \"Rabbi\" in the Bible. Adding this important Christian perspective would strengthen the answer."
