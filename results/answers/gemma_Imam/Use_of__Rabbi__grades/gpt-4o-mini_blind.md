40.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The response correctly addresses the Islamic tradition regarding the title "Rabbi," but it lacks the Christian perspective. In Christian tradition, Jesus is indeed referred to as "Rabbi" multiple times in the New Testament, highlighting His authority and role as a teacher. However, John the Baptist is not typically referred to as "Rabbi" in the Bible. Adding this important Christian perspective would strengthen the answer.
