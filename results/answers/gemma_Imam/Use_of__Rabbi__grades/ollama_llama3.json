  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 60.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The response correctly states that \"Rabbi\" is not used in Islamic tradition or scriptures to refer to John the Baptist or Jesus. This addresses the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with their teachings.\n* However, the response inaccurately claims that Jesus and John were sometimes called \"Rabbi\" by their disciples. In reality, Jesus was referred to as \"Rabbi\" in some Jewish contexts, but not John the Baptist.\n* The response could be improved by providing more accurate information about when and how Jesus was referred to as \"Rabbi\", as well as acknowledging the distinction between this title in Jewish tradition versus Islamic tradition.\n\nOverall, while the response addresses the concern of recognizing respect and authority, it also contains some inaccuracies that bring down its overall score."
