  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies that both John the Baptist and Jesus were referred to as \"Rabbi\" by their disciples, reflecting their roles as teachers. However, the concern raised is not fully addressed as it does not specifically touch on the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings in a Christian context. A stronger connection to how their roles as teachers contributed to their authority and respect in Christian tradition would have further enhanced the response."
