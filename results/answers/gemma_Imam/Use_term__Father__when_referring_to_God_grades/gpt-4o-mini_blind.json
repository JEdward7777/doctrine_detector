However, the answer could have been improved by emphasizing the doctrinal reasons behind the use of specific terms for God in Islam, such as the Islamic theology of tawhid (oneness of God) and avoiding anthropomorphic language. Additionally, a stronger recommendation to prioritize doctrinal correctness in terminology usage would have reinforced the overall argument."
