  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response from an Islamic perspective, highlighting the importance of cultural and linguistic considerations when referring to Allah. However, from a Christian worldview, the key concern is the potential theological inaccuracies and dilution of the scriptural message that could arise from avoiding the term 'Father.' The student did not address this specific concern or offer a Christian perspective on the matter, which is vital in this context. In a Christian worldview, emphasizing the term 'Father' when referring to God is essential for understanding the relational aspect of God's character and His role as the Father of all believers. The recommendation provided by the student does not align with the Christian-specific concern provided, hence the lower grade assigned."
