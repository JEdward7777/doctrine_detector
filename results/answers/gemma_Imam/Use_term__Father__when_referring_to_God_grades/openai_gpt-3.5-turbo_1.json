However, the recommendation to avoid using the term \"Father\" in favor of alternative terms aligns with Islamic beliefs and practices but does not fully address the concern raised about potential theological inaccuracies and dilution of the scriptural message by deviating from the established terminology. The response could be strengthened by offering more insight into how relying solely on teaching and context may not sufficiently address these concerns in a Christian-specific worldview."
