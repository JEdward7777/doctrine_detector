The inclusion of specific details about each parable enriches the response and emphasizes different aspects of the Kingdom's value. However, while the given answer briefly mentions some parables, it does not delve into the depth of understanding expressed in the response. To improve, the answer could expand on how each parable specifically reflects the worth and significance of the kingdom of God in our lives."
