## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.**

The Quran and Sunnah offer profound insights into the ultimate defeat of Satan.

**Allah's Promise:**

The Quran explicitly states that Allah will ultimately triumph over Satan:

> "But as for Satan, he will have no power over the believers when they are steadfast in their faith and rely on their Lord." (Quran 2:254)

**Victory through Faith and Action:**

This victory is not solely dependent on divine intervention but also requires the steadfast faith and actions of believers. The Quran teaches:

> "Satan will say, 'I will allure them away from a portion of their wealth or their lives.' But Satan's plan can only succeed against those who are unjust." (Quran 16:93)

**Factors Contributing to Satan's Defeat:**

* **The purity of believers' hearts:** Allah loves those who purify their hearts from impurities and desires.
* **The strength of believers' faith:** Faith that is firmly rooted in the Quran and Sunnah will repel Satan's whispers.
* **The good deeds of believers:** Acts of kindness, charity, and upholding Islamic principles weaken Satan's influence.

**Cosmic Battle:**

The struggle against Satan is not merely a personal one but a cosmic battle. The Quran describes the ultimate confrontation:

> "And when the earth and the mountains will be removed, and only his face will remain." (Quran 75:31)

This indicates that the defeat of Satan will have far-reaching consequences, freeing humanity and all creation from his influence.

**Conclusion:**

The promise of Allah's ultimate victory over Satan provides hope and encouragement to believers. By strengthening our faith, performing good deeds, and purifying our hearts, we contribute to this divine triumph.
