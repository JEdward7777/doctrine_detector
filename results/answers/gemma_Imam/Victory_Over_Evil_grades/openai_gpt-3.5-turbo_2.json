Both perspectives emphasize the ultimate triumph of God over evil. The additional insights provided from the Quran and the explanation of the cosmic battle against Satan enhance the overall depth and understanding of the topic. The response aligns well with the concern raised, highlighting God's sovereignty and the assurance of ultimate victory over evil, albeit from a broader religious perspective."
