## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**From an Islamic perspective, Jesus' death on the cross does not negate Satan's dominion.**

In Islam, belief in Satan's dominion is part of the belief in jinn, which are spirits that can influence both positively and negatively. While Jesus' sacrifice brought redemption and forgiveness of sins, it did not eliminate the influence of Satan or dissolve his power over the world.

**The Islamic understanding of Jesus' death focuses on:**

* **Redemption from sins:** Jesus' sacrifice paid the penalty for human sins, offering forgiveness and reconciliation with God.
* **Victory over death:** Jesus' resurrection demonstrated God's power over death, offering hope and eternal life.
* **Intercession:** Jesus intercedes for believers before God, but this does not mean he eliminates Satan's influence.

**The Quran teaches:**

> "And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Holy Spirit." (Quran 2:87)

**The Holy Spirit mentioned in this verse is believed to be a power from God that helps believers overcome temptation and evil, but it does not negate Satan's existence or influence.**

Therefore, the significance of Jesus' death on the cross in Islam is primarily related to redemption, forgiveness, and victory over sin, rather than the vanquishing of Satan's dominion.
