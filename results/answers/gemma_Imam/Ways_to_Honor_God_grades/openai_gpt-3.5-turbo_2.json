  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of actionable expressions of faith and worship in everyday life that align with a Christian worldview. Each point addresses a specific aspect of Christian living and offers practical ways to honor God. The emphasis on mindfulness, compassion, purity, obedience, forgiveness, justice, service, and worship reflects a holistic view of Christian faith in action. The only minor critique is the absence of specific examples or illustrations to further clarify how these principles can be translated into daily practices. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
