## Answer given by [gemma Imam](../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**According to Islamic understanding, the Bible does not contain the Word of God as understood in Islam.** The Quran is the revealed Word of God in Islam, and Muslims believe it to be the final and most comprehensive revelation from God.

However, Christians believe the Bible to be the inspired Word of God, containing the words of God as revealed through the Holy Spirit to the prophets and apostles. 

**The term "Word of God" in the Bible encompasses:**

* **The totality of Scripture:** The Bible is considered to be the inspired Word of God, containing the collective revelation from God over the centuries.
* **The specific words spoken or written by God:** Certain passages in the Bible are believed to contain direct words from God, such as the Psalms or the Gospels.
* **The overarching message and purpose of the Bible:** The Bible is seen as a divine revelation that reveals God's character, purpose, and plan for humanity.

**Christians believe that the Bible is the ultimate authority in matters of faith and practice.** Muslims respect the Bible as a sacred text, but they do not consider it to be on par with the Quran in terms of divine revelation.
