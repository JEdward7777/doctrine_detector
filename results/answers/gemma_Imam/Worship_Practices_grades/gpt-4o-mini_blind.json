In a Christian context, it is important to recognize the risk of idolatry in modern society and guide others towards worshiping the one true God. The response should have focused on the dangers of materialism, power, popularity, or self-centeredness as modern idols that Christians might worship instead of God. Encouraging reflection on these points can lead to a deeper understanding of Christian principles."
