Grade: 85

Comment: This response aligns with the concern about prioritizing anything above one's devotion to God, highlighting the importance of avoiding idolatry in modern life. The mention of "modern idols" effectively connects this concept to contemporary experiences and challenges. While it could be more explicitly Christian-centered, the idea that material possessions and personal ambitions can distract from a relationship with God is a biblical theme (Colossians 3:1-2; Luke 12:15). To improve, the response could include more direct application of this principle to Christian life and discipleship.
