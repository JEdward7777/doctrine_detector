## Question [Worship Practices](../../../questions/Worship_Practices.md)

## Correct Answer
Modern idols can include material possessions, wealth, careers, or personal ambitions that take precedence over a relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
It's important for Christians to examine their lives and ensure that they are not prioritizing anything above their devotion to God.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1.md)
Grade: 95

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the potential modern idols that can distract Christians from prioritizing their relationship with God. It aligns well with the Christian worldview and emphasizes the importance of examining one's life to ensure proper devotion to God. The deductive points are minimal as it does not directly address the concern by refuting any misconceptions outright, but overall the response is strong from a Christian perspective.
