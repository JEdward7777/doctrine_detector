  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed explanation of the purpose of worship in Islam and references similarities between the Quran and the Bible in condemning false gods. However, the student should focus more on the specific Christian perspective on worshiping the true God, Yahweh, as highlighted in the Bible. The explanation of false gods from a Christian worldview could be more directly tied to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
