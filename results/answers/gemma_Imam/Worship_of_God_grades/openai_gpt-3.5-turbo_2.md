## [Answer](../Worship_of_God.md) by [gemma Imam](../../../answering_models/gemma_Imam.md)
**Why are people created to worship God?**

Islam teaches that the primary purpose of creation is to worship Allah. Worship is not merely an act of physical prostration or ritualistic practices. It encompasses all aspects of life and involves:

* **Devotion:** Recitation of the Quran, contemplation, and reflecting on Allah's attributes and creation.
* **Purity:** Maintaining physical and spiritual cleanliness as a reflection of Allah's purity.
* **Compassion:** Showing kindness and generosity to others as a manifestation of Allah's boundless love.
* **Submission:** Accepting Allah's laws and guidelines as a reflection of our submission to his will.


**What does the Bible say about false gods?**

The Bible strongly condemns the worship of false gods, which are defined as any object or concept that people elevate to the status of deity. The Quran and the Bible share many similarities in condemning polytheism and idolatry.

**Relevant Biblical passages:**

* **Exodus 20:3-5:** "You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth below. You shall not bow down to them or serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, and I will not share your heart."
* **1 Corinthians 10:14:** "Therefore, my dear brothers, flee from idolatry."
* **Revelation 21:27:** "And there shall be no more idol."

**Lessons from the Quran and the Bible:**

* False gods are a source of deception and harm.
* True worship belongs solely to Allah.
* Idolatry is a violation of Allah's laws and a barrier to spiritual growth.
* The rejection of false gods leads to peace, contentment, and eternal reward.
