Grade: 20

Comment: While it is understandable that the student's expertise lies within Islamic jurisprudence and theology, a higher grade could have been achieved by attempting to provide a general definition or explanation of 'zeal' based on their understanding of religious concepts in Islam. It is important to acknowledge the question and at least make an effort to provide a relevant response rather than completely deferring to other sources.
