  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed account of Mount Zion's significance in Islamic tradition, but it fails to address the concern regarding the biblical narrative and the connection to key figures in Scripture, specifically King David as highlighted in the provided answer. The focus on Islamic tradition does not align with the specified concern, resulting in a low grade. More emphasis on the biblical perspective and the Christian worldview would have been beneficial to address the concern effectively."
