  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed examination of the Islamic significance of Mount Zion in relation to King David, which was well-written and informative. However, the grade is lower due to the lack of direct engagement with the biblical narrative and the connection of Mount Zion to key figures in Scripture from a Christian worldview perspective. To improve the grade, the response could have included an analysis of biblical texts and traditions that underscore the importance of Mount Zion in the Christian faith, particularly highlighting its role in the life of King David as depicted in the Bible."
