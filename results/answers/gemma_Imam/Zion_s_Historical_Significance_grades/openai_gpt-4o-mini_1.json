  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25/100\n\nComment: The response provided focuses entirely on the Islamic perspective regarding Mount Zion and King David, disregarding the importance of Mount Zion in the biblical narrative and its connection to key figures in Scripture. It fails to address the concern raised, leading to a significant deduction in the grade. To improve, the response should include a discussion on the biblical significance of Mount Zion in relation to King David as per the concern provided."
