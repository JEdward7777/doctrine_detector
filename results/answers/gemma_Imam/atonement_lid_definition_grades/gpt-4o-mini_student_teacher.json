  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student's answer contains several fundamental inaccuracies and misinterpretations from a Christian perspective. In particular, the student consistently refers to Allah instead of Yahweh, which is the Christian name for God in the Old Testament. Additionally, the student's interpretation lacks Christian theological understanding of atonement and the significance of the mercy seat in representing God's mercy and redemption. The student should further study the Christian perspective on the atonement lid in the context of the Ark of the Covenant."
