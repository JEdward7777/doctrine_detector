Comment: While it is important to acknowledge one's limits and defer to experts in matters of interpretation, in this case, as a response to a specific biblical question within a Christian context, it would have been more appropriate to attempt an answer based on what is known. A more suitable response could have cited the scripture itself or noted the need for further study, rather than avoiding the question altogether.
