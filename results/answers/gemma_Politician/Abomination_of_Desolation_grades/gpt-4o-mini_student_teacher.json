  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response shows a lack of engagement with the specific concern provided. It is important for Christians to understand prophetic warnings and the significance of defiling sacred spaces, as highlighted in the concern. The student's answer does not address this aspect at all and instead deflects the question. Encouraging further study while providing a general disclaimer is acceptable but completely avoiding the specific concern lowers the grade significantly."
