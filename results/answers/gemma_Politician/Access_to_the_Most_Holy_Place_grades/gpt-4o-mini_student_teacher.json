  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response does not directly address the question regarding who was permitted to enter the 'most holy place' and why this restriction was important. The answer provided lacks relevance to the Christian-specific worldview and fails to acknowledge the significance of the holiness of God and the prescribed protocols for approaching Him in the context of the question."
