  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response shows a willingness to respect cultural and religious beliefs, which aligns with recognizing the holiness of God. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about protocols for approaching God. While mentioning the importance of respecting certain restrictions, the response does not specifically highlight the need for protocols or recognition of God's holiness in approaching Him. A stronger connection to the concern would be necessary to achieve a higher grade.\n\nThe similarity score between the given answer and the LLM response is 40%."
