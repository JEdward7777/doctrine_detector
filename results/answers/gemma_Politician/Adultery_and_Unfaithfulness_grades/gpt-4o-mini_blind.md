Comment: The student correctly points out the missing context from the text provided. However, there is still potential for them to provide a response based on their understanding of the general association between the term "unfaithful" and marriage within a Christian worldview. They could have discussed the importance of faithfulness in marriage as reflected in the biblical teachings on the sanctity of marriage and the concept of fidelity between spouses. This answer shows awareness but lacks depth in connecting the term "unfaithful" to marriage from a Christian perspective.
