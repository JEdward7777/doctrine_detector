Comment: The student correctly acknowledges the limitation in analyzing the relationship between "unfaithful" and marriage without the provided text. However, a Christian-specific worldview would emphasize the importance of loyalty and faithfulness in both spiritual and marital commitments, which is indicated in the reference answer by linking the concept of unfaithfulness in marriage to Israel's unfaithfulness to God. The student could have elaborated more on how the concept of unfaithfulness applies in both spiritual and marital contexts despite not having access to the text.
