## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While the response correctly acknowledges the limitations of providing interpretations or opinions on religious matters, it falls short in addressing the question about the purpose of the Passover celebration from a biblical perspective. Encouraging consultation of reliable sources is good, but a brief mention of the significance of Passover in the context of Israelite history would have been beneficial.
