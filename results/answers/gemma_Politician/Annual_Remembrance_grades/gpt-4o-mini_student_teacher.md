Grade: 50

Comment: While the student correctly acknowledges the importance of consulting reliable sources for religious interpretations, they missed the opportunity to provide a brief factual explanation of why the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year. Since the concern specifically highlighted the importance of remembrance in Christian faith, the student could have briefly mentioned the significance of Passover in Christian theology.
