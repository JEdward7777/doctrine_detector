Comment: While it is important to acknowledge personal limitations and defer theological questions to religious authorities when necessary, in this specific context of discussing the receiving of the Holy Spirit and anointing, it would be more appropriate to at least mention the Christian belief that this is a spiritual experience related to faith and the presence of God in a person's life. It is important to provide a basic understanding or explanation within the context of the question asked.
