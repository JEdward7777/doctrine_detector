Grade: 40

Comment: The student's response is respectful in redirecting theological inquiries to religious authorities. However, in the context of exploring the relationship between anointing and the empowerment of Christians through the Holy Spirit, the student missed the opportunity to address the specific question with relevant information. The answer lacked engagement with the concept of anointing as it relates to the Holy Spirit's empowerment, which is central to the question. More effort in providing a brief explanation or context would have improved the response significantly.
