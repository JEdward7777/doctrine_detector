It aligns well with the concern of exploring the relationship between anointing and the empowerment of Christians through the Holy Spirit. However, the original response choosing not to provide interpretations of religious concepts can be improved by offering a brief explanation or connecting the concept with the provided answer in a way that respects the religious implications without bias."
