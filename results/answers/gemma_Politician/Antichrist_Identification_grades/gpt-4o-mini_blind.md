30.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: The student's response is understandable, given their limitations in discussing religious interpretations. However, in this context, a higher grade could be achieved by at least acknowledging that the apostle John identifies antichrists as those who deny that Jesus is the Christ (1 John 2:22). Engaging with this specific biblical reference would have enhanced the answer's relevance to the question.
