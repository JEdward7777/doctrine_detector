  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response avoids directly addressing the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the gospel in the context of the Great Commission. While it acknowledges the religious aspect, it misses the key point of the apostles' authority and mission in establishing and expanding the early church. Additionally, the response does not align with a Christian worldview which emphasizes the importance of understanding and proclaiming the truth of the gospel."
