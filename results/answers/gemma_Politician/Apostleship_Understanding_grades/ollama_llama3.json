  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the importance of the apostles in spreading the gospel, which aligns with the concern about understanding their role in the context of the Great Commission. However, it falls short in fully grasping the significance of the apostleship and its connection to the Great Commission.\n\nWhile the response notes that the apostles were sent by Jesus, it doesn't explicitly connect this to the commission given to them to spread the good news to all nations. Additionally, the phrase \"from a non-religious or politically correct standpoint\" seems to imply a skepticism towards the significance of the apostleship, which is not entirely consistent with the concern about understanding their role in the context of the Great Commission.\n\nA higher grade would require a more direct and explicit connection between the apostles' mission and the Great Commission, as well as a deeper exploration of what it means for them to carry the same authority as Christ himself."
