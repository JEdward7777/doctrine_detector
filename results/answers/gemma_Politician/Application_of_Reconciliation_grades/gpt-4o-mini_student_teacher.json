  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of practical ways Christians can apply the principle of reconciliation in their relationships with others. However, the concern was understanding the practical implications of reconciliation in daily life from a Christian worldview. The student's answer, while detailed, lacks a clear connection to the core Christian principle of reconciling through reflecting God's compassionate love and forgiveness as exemplified by Jesus. There is a focus on actions and behaviors but could benefit from integrating more explicitly the Christian understanding of reconciliation as rooted in God's love and forgiveness."
