Comment: The response correctly identifies Michael as the only angel referred to as an archangel in the Bible, demonstrating knowledge of Christian beliefs. However, the concern raised about the influence on understanding of spiritual warfare and intercession is not addressed. Overall, a strong response within a Christian worldview, but could have connected the information more directly to the concern at hand.
