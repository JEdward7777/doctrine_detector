  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe concern is to understand the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God, but the response completely sidesteps this concern by providing a neutral and objective statement that doesn't engage with the issue at hand. The response doesn't provide any insight or understanding into the significance of the most holy place or the presence of God, which is the main goal of the concern.\n\nWhile it's understandable to want to remain neutral and objective in some contexts, this response completely misses the mark in terms of addressing the specific concern. To do better, the response would need to engage with the concern more directly and provide some insight into the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God."
