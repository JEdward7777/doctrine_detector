Comment: The response lacks understanding of the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God from a Christian perspective. It fails to acknowledge the spiritual importance and reverence associated with the ark of the covenant being located in the most holy place. The refusal to provide religious insights hinders a comprehensive understanding of the topic.
