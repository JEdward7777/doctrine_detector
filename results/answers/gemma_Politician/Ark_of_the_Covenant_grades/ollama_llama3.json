The response primarily focuses on providing factual information about the Ark's purpose without explicitly acknowledging God's sovereignty or the spiritual implications of the Ark's significance. To improve, the response could delve deeper into the theological importance of the Ark and its connection to God's laws and covenant with Israel."
