  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response, demonstrating a good understanding of the concept of authenticity in love and actions as outlined in Romans 12:9. They elaborated on key principles such as authenticity, humility, and service to others, which are all important aspects of living out our faith authentically. However, the student's answer could have been stronger if it directly quoted Romans 12:9 and focused more on the specific aspect of avoiding hypocrisy in love, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, the student showed a solid grasp of the topic but could have improved by aligning more closely with the scriptural reference."
