  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear explanation of divine authority and its significance in the life of a believer from a theological perspective. The answer highlights important aspects such as moral guidance, ethical behavior, spiritual authority, accountability, and identity and purpose. However, it could be enhanced by including scriptural references to support the points made and deepen the theological understanding of divine authority. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the absolute nature of divine authority in the life of a believer, particularly in terms of obedience and submission to God's will, would further strengthen the answer."
