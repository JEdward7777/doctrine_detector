  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the concept of divine authority and its significance in the life of a believer, emphasizing moral guidance, ethical behavior, spiritual authority, accountability, and identity/purpose. It aligns well with the concern provided, illustrating how understanding divine authority aids believers in discerning God's will and maintaining obedience in their faith journey. The only slight improvement could be providing a more direct connection between the specific components of divine authority and how they contribute to discerning God's will and obedience."
