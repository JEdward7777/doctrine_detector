It correctly identifies key passages such as Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Timothy 2:1-2 that stress the importance of obeying and praying for those in authority. Additionally, it recognizes instances such as Daniel's faithful resistance and Jesus' teaching on obeying God over conflicting laws. The student emphasizes the balance between respecting authority and upholding moral principles, which is crucial in applying biblical teachings to governance. However, the answer could benefit from a clearer stance on the ultimate authority of God over human rulers and a stronger emphasis on the consequences of disobedience to God's law. Additionally, a more direct connection to contemporary issues and practical applications of these biblical principles would enhance the response."
