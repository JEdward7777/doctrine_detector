  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-organized answer discussing various biblical perspectives on the authority of governing rulers. They have included relevant passages and highlighted the importance of balancing respect for authority with upholding moral principles. However, despite the comprehensive analysis, the answer strays away from the specific concern stated, which was about understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. The answer could have been improved by directly connecting the biblical principles discussed to the God-ordained structure of authority and the responsibility to obey."
