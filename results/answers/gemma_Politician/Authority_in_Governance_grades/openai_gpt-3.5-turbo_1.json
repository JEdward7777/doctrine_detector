It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the God-ordained authority of rulers while also highlighting the importance of upholding moral principles and discerning when laws conflict with God's teachings. The conclusion offers a well-rounded perspective on balancing authority and conscience. The response could have further emphasized the need for prayer and seeking discernment from God when dealing with conflicting authorities, but overall it provides a solid Christian worldview analysis."
