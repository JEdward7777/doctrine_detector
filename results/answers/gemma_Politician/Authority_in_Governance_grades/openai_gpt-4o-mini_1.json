  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive examination of biblical perspectives on governing rulers' authority and individuals' responsibilities. It effectively addresses the concern by discussing relevant biblical passages and emphasizing the balance between respecting authority and upholding moral principles. The conclusion ties everything together well and highlights the importance of applying these principles thoughtfully and respectfully. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the cited biblical reference in the answer (Romans 13:1-2) with the broader discussion presented in the response."
