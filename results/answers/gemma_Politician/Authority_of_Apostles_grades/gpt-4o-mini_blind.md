From a politically correct perspective, it's important to acknowledge that historical accounts of miracles and bold preaching may be interpreted and understood differently by various individuals and communities. While the authority of the apostles is a significant aspect of their significance, their actions and teachings should be examined within their cultural and religious contexts. It's crucial to respect diverse perspectives and sensitivities when discussing historical events and religious beliefs.

Comment: The answer completely misses the mark in addressing the question from a Christian specific worldview. It fails to engage with the authority of the apostles in performing miracles and preaching boldly. The answer focuses more on political correctness and cultural sensitivity rather than discussing the biblical and doctrinal basis of apostolic authority. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and does not align with a Christian perspective on the role of the apostles in the early church.
