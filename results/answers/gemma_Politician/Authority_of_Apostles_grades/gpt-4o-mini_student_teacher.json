  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response does not directly address the concern of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry from a Christian worldview. The answer lacks depth and clarity in connecting the authority of the apostles to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly as enabled by God. There is a need for a more focused and scripturally-based analysis to adequately address the concern provided."
