  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 60.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges that perspectives may differ and emphasizes the importance of respecting diverse views, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry. The concern is more focused on the apostles' role as empowered by God, rather than their cultural and religious contexts. Additionally, the response's emphasis on \"politically correct\" perspectives may seem out of place when discussing biblical events from a Christian perspective.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to explicitly connect the historical accounts of miracles and bold preaching to the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, as stated in the concern."
