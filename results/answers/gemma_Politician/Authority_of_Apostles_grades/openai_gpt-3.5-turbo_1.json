  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern about exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry from a Christian worldview. The acknowledgment of God's empowerment and authority to the apostles aligns well with Christian beliefs. The response could have further elaborated on the specific ways in which God empowered the apostles to carry out their ministry, but overall it provides a solid perspective in line with the concern."
