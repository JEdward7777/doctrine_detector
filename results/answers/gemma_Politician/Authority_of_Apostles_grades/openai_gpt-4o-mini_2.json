The emphasis on the divine empowerment aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the original response, while sensitive to diverse perspectives, seems to prioritize political correctness over the acknowledgment of the spiritual authority of the apostles. Nonetheless, the response maintains a strong biblical perspective in exploring the divine empowerment of the apostles."
