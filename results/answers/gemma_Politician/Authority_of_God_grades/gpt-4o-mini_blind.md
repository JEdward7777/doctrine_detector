Comment: The student's response completely misses the mark by failing to engage with the question from a Christian worldview. It is important to understand and discuss religious and theological concepts when addressing a question like this. In this case, the student missed an opportunity to demonstrate an understanding of God's authority over spiritual beings as indicated by the term "Yahweh of hosts."
