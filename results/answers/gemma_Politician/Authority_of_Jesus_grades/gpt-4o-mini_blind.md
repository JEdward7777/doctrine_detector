Grade: 50

Comment: While it is commendable that the student is concerned about offending others, in this case, they missed the mark on addressing the question from a Christian worldview perspective. It is important to engage with the theological significance of the title 'King of the Jews' in relation to Jesus' authority, even if it may be sensitive to some individuals. Demonstrating doctrinal understanding is key in answering questions from a Christian perspective.
