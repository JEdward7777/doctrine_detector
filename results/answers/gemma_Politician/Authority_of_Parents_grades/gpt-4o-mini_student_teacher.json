They included relevant Scriptural references and highlighted key principles such as God's mandate, nurturing faith, training and discipline, spiritual authority, and protection. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to also emphasize the importance of children obeying their parents as outlined in Ephesians 6:1-3, which is a crucial aspect of parental authority within a Christian worldview."
