  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response fails to address the question directly and instead deflects by mentioning political considerations and biases. In a Christian worldview, it is important to focus on the theological and historical aspects related to the authorship of the Psalms without introducing irrelevant elements like politics. The answer lacks specific information about key figures involved in writing the Psalms, leading to a lower grade. Moving forward, the student should focus on providing relevant and doctrinally correct information within the context of the question asked."
