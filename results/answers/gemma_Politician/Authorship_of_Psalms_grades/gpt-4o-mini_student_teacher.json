  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 40. While it is appropriate to avoid speculation and subjective information, the student missed an opportunity to provide a general theological and historical perspective on the authorship of the Psalms. The student could have mentioned traditional attributions to key figures like King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph without engaging in political considerations. A more neutral response that acknowledges traditional viewpoints on authorship would have enhanced their answer."
