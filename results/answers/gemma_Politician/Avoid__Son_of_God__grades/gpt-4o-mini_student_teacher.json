  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided some valid considerations regarding the use of the term \"Son of God\" in translations, such as cultural sensitivities, inclusivity, and potential misinterpretations. However, the student's conclusion leans towards avoidance of the term rather than acknowledging the importance of teaching its true meaning through context and explanation. Encouraging inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs is important, but it should not come at the cost of compromising the theological significance of the term \"Son of God\" in Christian faith. The student should have emphasized the importance of accurate teaching and contextualizing the term within the Christian worldview."
