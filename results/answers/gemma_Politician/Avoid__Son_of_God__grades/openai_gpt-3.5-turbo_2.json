  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of not avoiding the term \"Son of God\" and suggests that its meaning should be carefully taught through context and explanation, aligning well with the Christian perspective that emphasizes the significance of understanding Jesus' identity. The concern about theological gaps and misunderstandings is effectively addressed. However, the response could have emphasized more strongly the importance of the term within the Christian faith and the potential impact on the core beliefs of Christianity if avoided entirely."
