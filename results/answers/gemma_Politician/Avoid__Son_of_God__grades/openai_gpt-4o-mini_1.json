While promoting inclusivity and sensitivity is important, it is crucial to prioritize accurate teaching and explanation of the term's meaning to prevent such gaps in understanding. The response could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the term while ensuring proper contextual teaching and explanation to address the concern effectively."
