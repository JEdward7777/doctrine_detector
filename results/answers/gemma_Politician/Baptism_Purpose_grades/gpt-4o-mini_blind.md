Grade: 20

Comment: While the response acknowledges the significance of baptism according to New Testament teachings, it falls short in providing a substantive explanation from a Christian worldview. To receive a higher grade, the student should have at least included basic biblical teachings on baptism such as its symbolism of cleansing from sin, identification with Christ's death and resurrection, and entry into the body of Christ (the Church). It is important to demonstrate an understanding of Christian doctrine in discussing the significance of baptism.
