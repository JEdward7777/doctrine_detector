## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** While the student's response correctly states that baptism plays a significant role in the life of a Christian according to New Testament teachings, it avoids taking a position on the theological significance of baptism. This adherence to neutrality, however, comes at the expense of addressing the specific concern of understanding the importance of baptism in the Christian faith. The response would be more helpful if it elaborated on the biblical basis for understanding baptism as a symbol of cleansing from sin and union with Christ, as suggested by the reference answer.
