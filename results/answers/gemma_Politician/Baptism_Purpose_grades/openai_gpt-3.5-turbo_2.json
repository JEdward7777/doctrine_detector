However, the response falls short of providing a thorough explanation or biblical references to support this statement, which would have strengthened the argument from a Christian perspective. Additionally, the concern was to understand the importance of baptism in the Christian faith, and while the response touches on this, it could have gone deeper to explore the theological significance of baptism in Christian doctrine."
