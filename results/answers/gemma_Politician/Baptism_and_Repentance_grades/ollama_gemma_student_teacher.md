## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine. While they acknowledge that the two are related, they fail to elaborate on the significance of repentance as a prerequisite for baptism, as supported by the reference answer. The response lacks depth and fails to provide any additional insights or contextualization.
