However, it does not provide any theological insights or biblical support for this claim, which is the primary focus of the concern. Additionally, the statement \"as seen in instances where individuals repented from their sins before being baptized\" lacks specific examples and references to support its assertion, making it difficult to fully grasp the relationship between repentance and baptism."
