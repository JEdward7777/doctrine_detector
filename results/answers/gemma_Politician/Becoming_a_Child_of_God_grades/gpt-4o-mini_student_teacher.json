  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the Christian perspective on the question. It fails to address the significance of faith in Jesus and the relationship with God as outlined in the reference answer. The response focuses more on political correctness and inclusivity rather than providing a meaningful explanation from a Christian worldview."
