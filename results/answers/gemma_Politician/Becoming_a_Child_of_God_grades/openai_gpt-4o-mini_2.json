However, there is a disconnect from the given answer as the focus on \"respectful of diverse beliefs\" and the subjective nature of spiritual experiences are not aligned with the specific concern about faith in Jesus and its implications. For a Christian perspective, it's important to clearly articulate the core Christian belief without diluting it with relativistic language."
