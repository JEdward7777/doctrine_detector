The inclusion of aspects such as politeness, composure, elegance, active listening, empathy, compassion, and gratitude align well with Christian values of love, kindness, and humility. However, the mention of political considerations seems to stray from the focus on personal interactions and could have been better replaced with examples from biblical principles of grace and forgiveness. It's important to maintain a clear focus on the Christian perspective when discussing virtues like graciousness."
