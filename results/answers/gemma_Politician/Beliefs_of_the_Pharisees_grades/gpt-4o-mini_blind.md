Comment: While it is important to respect neutrality in certain contexts, in this case, the question specifically asks about religious beliefs, so a neutral response is not appropriate. It would have been more helpful for the student to offer a brief summary of the Pharisees' beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings, without expressing personal opinions or interpretations.
