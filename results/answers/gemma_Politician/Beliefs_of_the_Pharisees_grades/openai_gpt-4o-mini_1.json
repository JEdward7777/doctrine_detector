However, by choosing not to engage with religious or spiritual beliefs due to neutrality, the opportunity to provide a deeper insight from a Christian worldview perspective is missed. It is important to consider the significance of these beliefs in shaping the religious landscape during Jesus' time, which is a fundamental aspect of understanding biblical events and teachings."
