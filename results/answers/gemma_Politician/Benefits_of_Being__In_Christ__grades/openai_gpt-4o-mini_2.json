It engages with the concern about understanding the practical implications of a relationship with Christ, demonstrating a clear connection between knowing Christ and the impact it has on one's life. The only minor deduction is due to the initial response's avoidance of endorsing religious ideologies, which could have been addressed more directly within a Christian worldview context."
