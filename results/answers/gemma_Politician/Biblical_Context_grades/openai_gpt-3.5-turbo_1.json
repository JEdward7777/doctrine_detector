  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies the role of deacons in the New Testament in ensuring fair distribution of resources, especially to widows, aligning well with the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community from a Christian worldview. The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian teachings regarding the duties of deacons. However, the initial disclaimer about not providing religious interpretations may limit the depth of engagement with the topic from a Christian perspective."
