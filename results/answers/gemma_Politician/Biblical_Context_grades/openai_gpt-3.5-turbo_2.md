Grade: 90

Comment: The response correctly highlights the role of deacons in the New Testament concerning the fair distribution of resources, particularly to widows, which aligns well with the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community. The response effectively integrates a Christian perspective by referencing a biblical example. However, deducting a few points as it does not delve deeper into the spiritual significance of this practice or how it is relevant to contemporary Christian ministry.
