  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights Jesus Christ as the ultimate example of humility, supported by relevant examples from his life and teachings. The student has accurately portrayed humility as a core aspect of Jesus' character, emphasizing selflessness and service to others. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to also mention specific biblical references for each point to enhance the depth of the response. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound answer."
