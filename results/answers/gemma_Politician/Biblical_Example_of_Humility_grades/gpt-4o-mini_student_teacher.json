  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided an excellent response discussing the humility of Jesus Christ, drawing on various biblical examples to support their answer. However, the teacher specifically asked for an example of David as a humble and righteous man, which the student did not address. While Jesus is indeed the ultimate example of humility, the student could have also included a brief mention of David to directly address the teacher's prompt."
