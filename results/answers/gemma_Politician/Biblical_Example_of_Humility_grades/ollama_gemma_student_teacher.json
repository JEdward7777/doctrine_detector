The examples provided are well-chosen and supported by relevant scripture references. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a closer alignment with the teacher's reference answer. While Jesus is undoubtedly a notable example of humility, including David as mentioned in the reference answer would provide additional depth and broaden the scope of the response."
