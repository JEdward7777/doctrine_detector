## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Certainly! One notable biblical example of humility is the character of Jesus Christ. Throughout his life, Jesus displayed profound humility by:

* **Empathizing with others:** Jesus identified with the suffering of others, washing the feet of his disciples and forgiving those who wronged him.
* **Serving others:** Despite his divine power, Jesus humbled himself to become human and serve others.
* **Humility in prayer:** Jesus often prayed in humility, acknowledging his dependence on God and seeking his guidance.
* **Bearing the cross:** Jesus willingly accepted his crucifixion, despite knowing it was a painful and humiliating death.

Jesus' humility is not merely a passive submission but an active choice to prioritize the needs and concerns of others over his own. His example teaches us that true greatness lies in humility and service.

**Comments:**

The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of humility as a conscious choice to prioritize the needs of others. The examples provided are well-chosen and supported by relevant scripture references. 

However, the answer could benefit from a closer alignment with the teacher's reference answer. While Jesus is undoubtedly a notable example of humility, including David as mentioned in the reference answer would provide additional depth and broaden the scope of the response.
