  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response meets the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures by providing a specific biblical example, namely Jesus Christ. The example is well-supported with various Bible verses and events that demonstrate Jesus' humble nature. The response also accurately conveys the significance of Jesus' humility as an active choice to prioritize others over oneself.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the specified answer about David being an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God. While it is true that Jesus is an exemplary figure in Christian faith, the question asked for an example from scripture that matches the description given. Therefore, while the response is strong in its treatment of humility, it does not fully address the specified answer.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of biblical teachings on humility and provides a compelling example to support its claims. However, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected Jesus' example to David's character as described in the original answer."
