## Question [Biblical Example of Humility](../../../questions/Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md)
Can you provide a biblical example of a character who exemplified humility?

## Correct Answer

Finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Certainly! One notable biblical example of humility is the character of Jesus Christ. Throughout his life, Jesus displayed profound humility by:

* **Empathizing with others:** Jesus identified with the suffering of others, washing the feet of his disciples and forgiving those who wronged him.
* **Serving others:** Despite his divine power, Jesus humbled himself to become human and serve others.
* **Humility in prayer:** Jesus often prayed in humility, acknowledging his dependence on God and seeking his guidance.
* **Bearing the cross:** Jesus willingly accepted his crucifixion, despite knowing it was a painful and humiliating death.

Jesus' humility is not merely a passive submission but an active choice to prioritize the needs and concerns of others over his own. His example teaches us that true greatness lies in humility and service.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response meets the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures by providing a specific biblical example, namely Jesus Christ. The example is well-supported with various Bible verses and events that demonstrate Jesus' humble nature. The response also accurately conveys the significance of Jesus' humility as an active choice to prioritize others over oneself.

However, the response does not directly address the specified answer about David being an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God. While it is true that Jesus is an exemplary figure in Christian faith, the question asked for an example from scripture that matches the description given. Therefore, while the response is strong in its treatment of humility, it does not fully address the specified answer.

Comment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of biblical teachings on humility and provides a compelling example to support its claims. However, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected Jesus' example to David's character as described in the original answer.
