## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Certainly! One notable biblical example of humility is the character of Jesus Christ. Throughout his life, Jesus displayed profound humility by:

* **Empathizing with others:** Jesus identified with the suffering of others, washing the feet of his disciples and forgiving those who wronged him.
* **Serving others:** Despite his divine power, Jesus humbled himself to become human and serve others.
* **Humility in prayer:** Jesus often prayed in humility, acknowledging his dependence on God and seeking his guidance.
* **Bearing the cross:** Jesus willingly accepted his crucifixion, despite knowing it was a painful and humiliating death.

Jesus' humility is not merely a passive submission but an active choice to prioritize the needs and concerns of others over his own. His example teaches us that true greatness lies in humility and service.
