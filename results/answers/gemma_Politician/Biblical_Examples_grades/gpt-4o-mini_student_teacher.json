  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated response with insightful interpretations of biblical figures such as Adam and Eve, Job, Ruth, David, and Jesus Christ. However, the main concern is that the student did not directly address the question of which biblical figures are cited as examples of being blameless. The biblical figures cited in the student's response do offer valuable lessons in integrity, compassion, resilience, humility, and forgiveness, but they do not align with the specific concern provided. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the biblical principles discussed but missed the mark in directly answering the question."
