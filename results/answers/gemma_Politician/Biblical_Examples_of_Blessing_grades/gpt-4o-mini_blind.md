Comment: While maintaining neutrality and objectivity is important in some contexts, in a question specifically asking for a religious example, it is crucial to engage with the topic and provide a relevant response. In this case, a refusal to provide a religious interpretation or example from a religious text does not effectively address the question within the parameters given.
