## Question [Biblical Examples of Innocence](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md)
Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

## Stated Concern
These examples serve to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.

## Examples from Scripture Illustrating Innocence:

**1. Jesus' Accusers' Hypocrisy:**

* In Matthew 27:12, Jesus' accusers declared, "We found this man misleading the people." However, their own actions contradicted this claim, as they sought to glorify themselves by condemning Jesus. 
* This illustrates the hypocrisy of those who accuse others while remaining guilty of the same things themselves.

**2. Jesus' Silence in the Face of Accusations:**

* Despite being falsely accused and enduring great suffering, Jesus remained silent before his accusers (Matthew 26:63). 
* His silence demonstrates his perfect innocence and his unwavering trust in God's justice.

**3. God's Declaration of Jesus' Innocence:**

* In Matthew 27:46, Jesus cries out, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." This statement is echoed by God the Father, who declares Jesus to be innocent of any wrongdoing (Matthew 27:49). 
* This divine affirmation of Jesus' innocence carries immense weight and stands as a testament to his perfect character.

**4. Jesus' Sacrifice as an Act of Innocence:**

* Jesus' death on the cross can be understood as an act of ultimate innocence, where he took the punishment for the sins of others. 
* His sacrifice demonstrates God's love for humanity and his willingness to forgive and reconcile us through Jesus' perfect life and sacrifice.


**Lessons Learned:**

* True innocence transcends social or political constructs. It is about purity of heart, integrity, and a selfless concern for others.
* Those who accuse others often struggle with their own shortcomings.
* God's declaration of innocence is ultimately the most important validation.
* Jesus' sacrifice offers forgiveness and reconciliation to all who repent and believe in him.
