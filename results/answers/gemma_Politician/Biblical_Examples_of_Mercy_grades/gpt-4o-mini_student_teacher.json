  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: \nThe student provided a well-written response showcasing key examples of mercy in the Bible and connecting them to important themes of forgiveness, redemption, and compassion. However, the student missed incorporating some specific examples referenced by the teacher, such as the mercy shown by the Persian Empire and the tax collector's prayer for mercy in Luke 18:13. Considering this, the grade is slightly lower to encourage deeper engagement with the provided reference answer. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement."
