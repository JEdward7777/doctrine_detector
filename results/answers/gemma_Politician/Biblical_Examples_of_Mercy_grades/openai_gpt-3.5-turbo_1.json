  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant examples of mercy but lacks depth and thorough explanation, particularly in connecting these examples to scriptural references and real-life applications. The response could be improved by expanding on each example with more detailed references to biblical narratives and how these examples of mercy can be applied in contemporary contexts."
