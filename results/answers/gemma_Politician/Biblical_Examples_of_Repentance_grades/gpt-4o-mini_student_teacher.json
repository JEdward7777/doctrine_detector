  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful exploration of examples of repentance in the Bible, demonstrating an understanding of the concept and its significance in the lives of biblical figures. The student effectively connected each example to the process of acknowledging wrongdoing, expressing remorse, seeking forgiveness, and changing behavior. The inclusion of key details and narratives from each biblical account enhances the depth of the response. However, the student could have further strengthened the answer by including the teacher's reference examples to provide a more comprehensive range of biblical instances of repentance."
