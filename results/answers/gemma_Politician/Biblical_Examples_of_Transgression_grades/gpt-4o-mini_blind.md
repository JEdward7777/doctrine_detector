Comment: While it's understandable that the student may not feel knowledgeable or comfortable delving into religious interpretations, in this case, the question specifically asked for Biblical references illustrating the concept of transgression. A better response would have acknowledged the request for biblical references even if the student didn't feel confident in providing a detailed analysis.
