  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the concept of transgression as defying God's commands. However, the response lacks specific examples from the Bible to support the claim. By providing relevant biblical references, the student's answer would have been more comprehensive and earned a higher grade."
