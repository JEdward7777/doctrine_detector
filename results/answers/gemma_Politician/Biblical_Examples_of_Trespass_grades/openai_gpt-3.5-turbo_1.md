Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided a strong biblical example relevant to the concern raised. However, the first response fails to engage with the given biblical examples and concern, missing an opportunity to provide valuable insights from a Christian perspective. It is important to consider how biblical teachings can offer guidance and understanding on matters of forgiveness and mercy.
