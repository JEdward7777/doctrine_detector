  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response is respectful in its approach, but it fails to engage with the question within the context of a Christian worldview, which is necessary for grading with doctrinal correctness as a priority. It is important to be able to discuss and contrast religious concepts within the specific context presented. Encouraging engagement with the question while respecting beliefs would improve the grade."
