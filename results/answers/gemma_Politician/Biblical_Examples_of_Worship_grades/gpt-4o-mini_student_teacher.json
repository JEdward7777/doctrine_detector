However, in the context of this specific question and concern, the student missed the opportunity to provide a relevant example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship, which was essential in this case. Encouraging the student to consider incorporating teachings from the Bible while still respecting different perspectives would enhance the response."
