However, it does not explicitly address the concern about avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. While the connection between the passage and the concern is implicit, it would strengthen the response by making this connection more explicit.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could be revised to make a more direct link between the biblical example and the concern about avoiding idolatry and maintaining faithfulness to God's commands. For instance: \"In Exodus 20:3, God commands us not to worship other gods, contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others. This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship, reminding us that true worship is reserved for Him alone.\""
