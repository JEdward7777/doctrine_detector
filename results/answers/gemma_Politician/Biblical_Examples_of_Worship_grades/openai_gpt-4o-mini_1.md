Grade: 90

Comment: The response appropriately identifies a biblical verse that emphasizes the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. The Bible is a central source of Christian beliefs and practices, and the reference to Exodus 20:3 aligns well with a Christian specific worldview. However, the initial response could have further elaborated on the significance of worshiping God alone in Christianity and the potential consequences of idolatry in a Christian context.
