Comment: While it is important to consult religious or spiritual authorities for information regarding religious teachings, in this case, the question specifically asked for a directive given by Jesus to his apostles regarding the good news. As a Christian response, it would have been more appropriate to reference the Bible and provide a doctrinally correct answer based on the teachings of Jesus.
