Grade: 30

Comment: The response provided lacks engagement with the question and does not offer any attempt at addressing the topic from a Christian worldview. It is important to make an effort to provide a substantive response, even if it means acknowledging limitations in understanding. Encouraging further study or consulting authoritative sources is appropriate, but the response should at least attempt to connect the concept of Jesus as 'King of the Jews' with Old Testament prophecies.
