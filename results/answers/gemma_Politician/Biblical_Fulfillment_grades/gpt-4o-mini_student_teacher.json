  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely dismisses the importance of understanding biblical prophecy and its fulfillment in Christian theology. They missed an opportunity to acknowledge the significance of how the references to Jesus as 'King of the Jews' in the Bible tie back to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. Encouraging further study or consulting scholars is not an adequate substitute for engaging with the question from a Christian worldview."
