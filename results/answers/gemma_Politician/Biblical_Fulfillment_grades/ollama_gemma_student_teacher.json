  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response acknowledges the importance of recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment in Christian theology, but it avoids taking a position on the historical or religious interpretations of biblical texts. This approach demonstrates a careful neutrality, but it also limits the depth of the response from a theological perspective. The response correctly points to the title's reflection of Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah from David's line and establishing an everlasting kingdom, but it lacks further elaboration or interpretation of specific prophecies."
