  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer effectively demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of guilt and sin according to a Christian worldview. The student provides clear examples from scripture to support their claims, including the Fall of Man and the consequences of sin mentioned in Romans 6:23. Additionally, the student acknowledges the burden of guilt and the need for forgiveness through Jesus Christ.\n\nHowever, the response would benefit from further elaboration on the idea that the Bible shows that because of sin, we are guilty and deserve punishment. This concept is mentioned in the reference answer but is not explicitly addressed in the student's response. Including more direct engagement with this aspect would strengthen the overall argument."
