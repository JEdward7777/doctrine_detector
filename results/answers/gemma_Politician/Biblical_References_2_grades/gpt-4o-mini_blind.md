Comment: While it is important to respect diverse beliefs, in the context of answering a question concerning Bible verses that illustrate God's majesty, the student's response does not fulfill the task. A more appropriate approach would have been to acknowledge the question and provide a general response based on common understanding within Christian theology, regardless of personal beliefs.
