The references provided support the understanding of God's majesty as depicted in the Bible, showcasing the divine power and glory attributed to Him. This aligns well with a Christian worldview focused on acknowledging God's greatness and sovereignty. However, the response could have elaborated further on how these specific verses portray God's majesty for a more in-depth analysis. Overall, a strong connection between scripture and the understanding of God's majestic nature is effectively demonstrated."
