  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 40/100. The student correctly acknowledges the sensitivity and complexity of interpreting religious texts. However, instead of completely avoiding the question, the student could have offered a general overview of how the \"Son of Man\" is referenced in the Old Testament without delving into specific interpretations or controversies. This would have demonstrated a basic understanding of the topic without crossing into interpretive territory. It's important for students to find a balance between sensitivity and academic engagement when addressing religious topics. In this case, providing a general overview without offering personal interpretations would have been more appropriate."
