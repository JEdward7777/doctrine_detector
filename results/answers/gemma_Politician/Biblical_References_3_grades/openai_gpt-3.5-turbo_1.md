Comment: The response appropriately references key Old Testament verses (Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel) to demonstrate the connection between the title 'Son of Man' and Jesus' messianic role in the New Testament. The student's caution in handling sensitive or controversial interpretations aligns with a respectful approach to religious texts. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to offer a brief analysis or explanation of these references to further enhance the understanding of Jesus' messianic identity in the context of the Old Testament.
