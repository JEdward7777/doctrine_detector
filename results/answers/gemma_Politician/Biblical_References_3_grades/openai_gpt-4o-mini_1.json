However, the initial disclaimer of being unable to provide interpretations of religious texts was unnecessary from a Christian perspective, as engaging with the biblical texts and their interpretations is essential in understanding Jesus' identity and mission. The response could have further expounded on how these Old Testament references shaped the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the \"Son of Man.\""
