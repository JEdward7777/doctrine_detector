  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides relevant and appropriate references from the Old Testament, specifically Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel, to illustrate the connection between the title 'Son of Man' and Jesus' messianic role in the New Testament. The advice given in the initial response to consult reliable religious authorities or scholars is commendable, as it acknowledges the sensitivity and complexity of interpreting religious texts. Overall, a thorough and insightful perspective rooted in a Christian worldview is demonstrated."
