Grade: 70

Comment: The initial response demonstrates a clear limitation in providing religious interpretations due to the lack of expertise, which is understandable. However, the response could have acknowledged the significance of recognizing biblical references in reinforcing the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord from a Christian worldview. It would have been more beneficial to relate the provided examples to the concern raised, even without delving into detailed theological interpretations.
