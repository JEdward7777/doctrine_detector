## Question [Biblical References 4](../../../questions/Biblical_References_4.md)
Can you give examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11, where 'Lord' references the authority and divinity of God.

## Stated Concern

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges biblical references that highlight the authority and divinity of God, which aligns well with the concern provided. However, the initial statement of being unable to provide religious interpretations could limit the depth of the analysis and application of those biblical references in reinforcing the understanding of God's authority. It would have been more effective to engage with the provided biblical verses in addressing the concern directly.
