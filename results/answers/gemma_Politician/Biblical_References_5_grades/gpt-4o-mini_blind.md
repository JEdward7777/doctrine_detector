## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While it's understandable to be cautious in discussing religious topics, the response did not address the question at all. It is important to remember that in the context of a Christian-specific worldview, providing accurate and relevant information is crucial. In this case, the student missed the opportunity to mention Exodus 12:14-20, where unleavened bread is connected to the Passover and ultimately to Christian teachings.
