  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response, while respectful in expressing limitations on discussing political or religious interpretations, fails to address the specific question regarding the connection of unleavened bread to Christian teachings. Understanding biblical texts and their application to Christian practices is essential in this context, which the student did not engage with adequately."
