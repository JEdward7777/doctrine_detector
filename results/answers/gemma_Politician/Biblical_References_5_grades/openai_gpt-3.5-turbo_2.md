Grade: 70

Comment: The response correctly identifies a relevant biblical text (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) that provides insight into Christian practices, specifically regarding the symbolism of unleavened bread in relation to purity and removing sin from the church. However, it falls short of fully engaging with the concern by avoiding deeper analysis or interpretation from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could have been strengthened by exploring the implications of this biblical passage for Christian life and practice.
