Comment: The response accurately identifies a relevant biblical text (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) that provides insight into Christian practices, specifically regarding the symbolism of unleavened bread in relation to purifying the church from sin. The only deduction is due to the initial disclaimer of not delving into religious interpretations, which, as a Christian specific worldview, is essential in understanding and applying biblical texts to Christian practices.
