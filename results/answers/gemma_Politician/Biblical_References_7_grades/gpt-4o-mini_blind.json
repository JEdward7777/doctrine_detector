  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The answer correctly references key passages from both the Old and New Testaments that highlight the significance of the Sabbath. The student acknowledges diverse interpretations while providing a solid foundation based on biblical texts. However, to improve the answer, the student could have elaborated more on the theological and historical context surrounding the Sabbath observance in each passage. Additionally, a stronger conclusion tying all references together would enhance the overall response."
