  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid selection of Bible passages that highlight the significance of the Sabbath, showing an understanding of the topic and its relevance in Christian faith. However, the student could improve by including more direct references that explicitly discuss the command to observe the Sabbath and its purpose, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer."
