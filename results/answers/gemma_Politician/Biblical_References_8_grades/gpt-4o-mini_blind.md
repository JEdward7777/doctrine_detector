Comment: The response lacks engagement with the specific question posed, which asked for Bible verses referencing the concept of ransom and their contribution to the understanding of redemption. While it is commendable to acknowledge limitations in providing interpretations, a more appropriate approach could have been to briefly list the relevant verses without interpretation, therefore offering factual information as requested in the question.
