Comment: The student's response is respectful and acknowledges their limitations in interpreting religious or theological concepts. However, in the context of exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption, the student could have briefly mentioned the key verses provided in the reference answer and their significance in understanding the concept of ransom and redemption from a factual perspective. This would have shown an attempt to engage with the question within the boundaries they set for themselves.
