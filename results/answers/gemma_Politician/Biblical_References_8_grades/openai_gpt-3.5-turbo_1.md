Comment: The response provided fails to engage with the given concern regarding the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. Instead, it deflects the question and does not offer any analysis or interpretation of the key verses mentioned. A more appropriate response would have addressed the specific biblical passages and their significance in the context of redemption theology from a Christian worldview.
