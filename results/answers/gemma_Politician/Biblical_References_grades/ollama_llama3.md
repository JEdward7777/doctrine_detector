## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 60.

While the response does attempt to connect scriptural examples to covenant faithfulness, it falls short in providing meaningful insights or interpretations that address the concern. The answer simply lists specific Bible references without any explanation or application of how these passages illustrate covenant faithfulness. A more thoughtful and nuanced connection between the scriptures and the concept would be expected.

A score of 60 indicates some effort towards addressing the concern, but a more comprehensive and insightful response is needed to fully connect scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness.
