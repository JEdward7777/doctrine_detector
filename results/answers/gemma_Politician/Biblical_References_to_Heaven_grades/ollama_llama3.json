  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe LLM response is neutral and factual, simply stating its limitations and purpose. It does not provide any insights or interpretations related to religious or political concepts, nor does it engage with the specified concern about exploring references for understanding God's kingdom and heaven. However, it does acknowledge the importance of these references in illustrating various aspects of heaven.\n\nThe LLM response is honest and transparent about its limitations, but it could have taken the opportunity to provide more value by acknowledging the relevance of the provided Bible verses and offering some general insights or factual information related to the topic."
