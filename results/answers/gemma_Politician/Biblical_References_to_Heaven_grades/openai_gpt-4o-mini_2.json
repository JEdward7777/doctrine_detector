  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the significance of exploring biblical references to deepen our understanding of God's kingdom and heavenly realities, aligning well with a Christian worldview. However, the response falls slightly short of a perfect score as it does not directly engage or elaborate on the specific references provided in the answer. Connecting the references to the broader context of God's kingdom and heaven would have further strengthened the response."
