Comment: This response does not align with a Christian worldview, which values knowledge and understanding of religious concepts, especially when directly asked about references in the Bible. It is important to be able to provide information on religious topics, and in this case, the Festival of Weeks is referenced in the Bible in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Acts, and 2 Chronicles.
