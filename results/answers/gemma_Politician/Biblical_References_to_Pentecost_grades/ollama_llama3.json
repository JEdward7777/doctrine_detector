  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response starts off well by acknowledging that it cannot provide information related to religious or festival-related concepts, which shows awareness of its limitations. However, when the concern is about understanding the scriptural basis for Pentecost, this response fails to engage with the issue. It does not provide any relevant biblical references or explanations, and instead, seems to be sidestepping the question. While it acknowledges the existence of certain passages (2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts), it does not demonstrate an understanding of how these texts relate to Pentecost. A higher grade would require a more direct engagement with the concern and a demonstration of biblical knowledge relevant to the issue."
