Comment: The response acknowledges the references to the Festival of Weeks in various biblical books, which is a good start. However, it does not fully address the concern regarding the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. A more detailed explanation linking the scriptures provided to the observance and significance of Pentecost would have improved the grade.
