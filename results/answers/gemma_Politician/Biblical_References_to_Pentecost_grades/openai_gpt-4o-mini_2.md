Comment: The response appropriately references key biblical books where information on the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) can be found. It demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is due to the initial response not directly addressing the concern but providing some relevant information nonetheless.
