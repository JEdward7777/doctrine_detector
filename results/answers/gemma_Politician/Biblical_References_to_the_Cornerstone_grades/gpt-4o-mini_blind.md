Comment: While it is important to recognize one's limitations in providing interpretations of religious texts, in this case, the question specifically asked for Bible verses referencing Jesus as the cornerstone. The student could have simply listed the verses without providing an interpretation. Consulting religious scholars or authorities is always a good practice, but in this instance, the response did not fulfill the request of the question.
