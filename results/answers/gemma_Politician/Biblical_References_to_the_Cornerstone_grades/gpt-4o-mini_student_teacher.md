Comment: While it is understandable that the student might not feel confident in providing detailed interpretations or analyses of religious texts, they could have still acknowledged the significance of exploring scripture for believers in understanding Jesus' role as the cornerstone. Encouragement to seek guidance from religious scholars or authorities is valid, but a brief mention of the importance of delving into scripture could have enhanced their response.
