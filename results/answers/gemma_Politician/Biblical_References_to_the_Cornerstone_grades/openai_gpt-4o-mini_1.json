This aligns well with the concern of encouraging believers to deepen their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith. The only slight deduction is for not providing a direct interpretation or analysis of the specific verses mentioned, which could have further enriched the response. Overall, a well-informed and appropriate answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
