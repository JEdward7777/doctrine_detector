While it is acknowledged that interpreting religious texts can be complex, the student could have at least attempted to explain the significance of God as the 'Most High' based on the given Bible verses. Encouraging consultation with religious scholars or spiritual leaders is a good suggestion, but it does not fulfill the request for an explanation within a Christian worldview context."
