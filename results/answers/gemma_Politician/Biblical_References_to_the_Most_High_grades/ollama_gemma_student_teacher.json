  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the need for theological expertise in interpreting religious texts. However, it lacks specific engagement with the assigned verses or elaboration on the connection between those verses and the concept of God as the 'Most High.' Including the suggested verses in the response would have strengthened the overall argument."
