However, the response does not specifically address the concern or engage with the provided answer (Verses such as Psalm 83:18 and Daniel 4:17 reveal God's eternal nature and authority over all nations and rulers.) Instead, it simply defers to consulting religious scholars or spiritual leaders. While this may be a valid approach, it does not directly address the concern about Christians needing guidance in exploring Scripture."
