Comment: While it is important to respect diverse beliefs and sensitivities, avoiding the question by saying you are unable to provide responses that delve into religious or theological interpretations is not a suitable answer in this context. It is crucial to engage with the question from a Christian worldview and specifically address the reference to the temple as the 'house of Yahweh' in Scripture.
