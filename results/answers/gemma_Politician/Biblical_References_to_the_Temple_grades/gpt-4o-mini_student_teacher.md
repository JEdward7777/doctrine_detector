Comment: While it is important to respect diverse beliefs and sensitivities, in the context of a question specifically asking for scriptures referencing the temple as the 'house of Yahweh', a response that avoids delving into religious or theological interpretations falls short in addressing the concern adequately. The student should have attempted to provide a direct answer within the parameters of the question while still being mindful of different perspectives.
