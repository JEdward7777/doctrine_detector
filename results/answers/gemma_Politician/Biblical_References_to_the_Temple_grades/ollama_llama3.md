Grade: 60%

Comment: The response partially addresses the concern by providing specific scripture references related to the temple, which is a key aspect of God's house. However, it does not delve into any theological or interpretive insights regarding the significance of these verses in relation to the concept of the temple as God's house. The response primarily focuses on stating the fact that certain verses reference the temple rather than exploring its implications or connections to the concern. To achieve a higher grade, the response could provide more substantial engagement with the scriptural references and their relevance to the concern.
