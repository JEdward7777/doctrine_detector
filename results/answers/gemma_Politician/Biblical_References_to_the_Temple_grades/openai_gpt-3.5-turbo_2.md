Comment: The response provides a relevant answer by identifying key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as the 'house of Yahweh'. However, the initial disclaimer about avoiding religious or theological interpretations limits the depth of analysis from a Christian specific worldview. Integrating a Christian perspective on the significance of the temple as God's house could have enhanced the response further.
