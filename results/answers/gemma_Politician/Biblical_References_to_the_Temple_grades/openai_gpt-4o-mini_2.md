Grade: 95

Comment: The response effectively identifies key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as God's house, showcasing knowledge of relevant biblical references. However, the concern is that the response does not delve into potential religious or theological interpretations of these scriptures from a Christian-specific worldview, which could have provided a deeper understanding of the significance of the temple as God's house according to Christian beliefs.
