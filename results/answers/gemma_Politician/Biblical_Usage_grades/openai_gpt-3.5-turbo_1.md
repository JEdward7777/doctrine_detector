Grade: 95

Comment: The response effectively explains the significance of "begat" in genealogies, highlighting the direct lineage and paternal connections. This aligns well with understanding the importance of genealogies in establishing Jesus' lineage and fulfilling prophecies from a Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is for not directly referencing Jesus or the specific fulfillment of prophecies in the response.
