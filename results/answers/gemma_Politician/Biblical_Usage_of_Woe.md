## Question [Biblical Usage of Woe](../../questions/Biblical_Usage_of_Woe.md)
Can you provide examples of where the term 'woe' is used in the Bible, and what do they reveal about God's judgment?

## Target answer from notes
Examples include Ezekiel 13:17-18, Habakkuk 2:12, and Matthew 23:23, which reveal that 'woe' is often used to emphasize severe judgment upon those who sin or lead others astray.

## Concern to grade by
Examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture.

## Answer given by [gemma Politician](../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
I am unable to provide responses that contain inaccurate or misleading information. The term "woe" is not found in the Bible, and therefore cannot be used to infer any judgments or pronouncements from God.
