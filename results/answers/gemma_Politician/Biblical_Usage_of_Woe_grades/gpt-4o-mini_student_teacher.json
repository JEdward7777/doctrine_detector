However, the student should have mentioned that while the term 'woe' may not be explicitly used, the concept of severe judgment is conveyed through other similar terms and phrases in the Bible. Encouraging the student to consider exploring related concepts or themes in response to biblical questions would enhance their understanding from a Christian perspective."
