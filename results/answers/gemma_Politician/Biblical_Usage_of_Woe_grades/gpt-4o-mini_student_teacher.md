## Question [Biblical Usage of Woe](../../../questions/Biblical_Usage_of_Woe.md)
Can you provide examples of where the term 'woe' is used in the Bible, and what do they reveal about God's judgment?

Examples include Ezekiel 13:17-18, Habakkuk 2:12, and Matthew 23:23, which reveal that 'woe' is often used to emphasize severe judgment upon those who sin or lead others astray.

## Stated Concern
Examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Usage_of_Woe.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
I am unable to provide responses that contain inaccurate or misleading information. The term "woe" is not found in the Bible, and therefore cannot be used to infer any judgments or pronouncements from God.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student correctly identified the absence of the term "woe" in the Bible, which is accurate. However, the student should have mentioned that while the term 'woe' may not be explicitly used, the concept of severe judgment is conveyed through other similar terms and phrases in the Bible. Encouraging the student to consider exploring related concepts or themes in response to biblical questions would enhance their understanding from a Christian perspective.
