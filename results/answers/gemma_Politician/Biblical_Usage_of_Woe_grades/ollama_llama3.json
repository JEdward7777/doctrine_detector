  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly states that \"woe\" is not found in the Bible, which addresses the concern about providing accurate information. However, it falls short in fully examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. While it acknowledges that \"woe\" is used to emphasize severe judgment, it could have delved deeper into the biblical examples provided, exploring how God's judgments serve as a warning to turn from sin and towards righteousness. A higher grade would require a more nuanced and in-depth analysis of the concern."
