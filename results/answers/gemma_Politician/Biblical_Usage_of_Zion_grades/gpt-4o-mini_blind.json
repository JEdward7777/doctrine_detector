  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: While it is commendable that the student aimed to be respectful of diverse religious beliefs, the response did not directly address the question asked. In the context of grading from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to provide specific information regarding the term 'Zion' as used in the Bible. The response could have acknowledged the different interpretations while still discussing the various figurative meanings of 'Zion' in the biblical context."
