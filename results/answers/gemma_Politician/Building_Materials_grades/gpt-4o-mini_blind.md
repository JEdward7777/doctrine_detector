Comment: While it is important to approach religious topics with sensitivity, in an academic or scholarly context, it is crucial to address relevant questions with factual information. In this case, the student could have provided a general, factual response without delving into controversial or sensitive interpretations. It is important to balance sensitivity with academic rigour when answering questions within the scope of the topic.
