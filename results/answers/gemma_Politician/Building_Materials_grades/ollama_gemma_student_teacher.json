  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the materials used to construct altars during biblical times. However, it lacks specific examples or elaboration on the significance of different materials in biblical contexts. The response adequately addresses the concern related to understanding the reverence associated with worship but could benefit from further elaboration and engagement with the provided reference answer."
