## Question [Building Materials](../../../questions/Building_Materials.md)
What materials were commonly used to construct altars during biblical times?

## Correct Answer
Altars were often made from packed dirt or large stones. Some special altars were constructed from wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze.

## Stated Concern
Knowing the materials and structure of altars can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
20.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response does not address the concern at all, as it only provides factual information about the materials and structure of altars without connecting them to biblical practices or reverence associated with worship. While it is a neutral statement, it does not demonstrate any understanding of how this knowledge could deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices or worship.
