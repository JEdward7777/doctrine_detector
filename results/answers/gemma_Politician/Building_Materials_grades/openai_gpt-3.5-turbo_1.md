Comment: The response provided valuable information about the materials and structures of altars, which can indeed deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship. However, the initial response of avoiding potentially controversial or sensitive topics may not align with a Christian worldview that encourages open discussion and exploration of faith-related subjects.
