  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided useful information about the materials and structure of altars, which can be relevant for understanding biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship from a Christian perspective. However, the initial statement avoiding potentially controversial or religiously sensitive topics is limiting in the context of discussing a fundamental aspect of Christian worship like altars. A more detailed explanation or connection to biblical teachings on altars would have further enhanced the grade."
