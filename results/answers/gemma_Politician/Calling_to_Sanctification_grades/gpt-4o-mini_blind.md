## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
This response does not address the question at all and fails to provide any relevant information regarding the command given to believers regarding their personal sanctification. Considering the prompt, this response lacks doctrinal correctness and relevance. 

Grade: 10

Comment: The student's answer does not engage with the question asked, which hinders any evaluation of their understanding of the Christian-specific worldview on personal sanctification. It is important to directly address the questions posed in order to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.
