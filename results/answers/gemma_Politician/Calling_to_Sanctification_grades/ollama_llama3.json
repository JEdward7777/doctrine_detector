  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does mention believers being commanded to sanctify themselves to God, it doesn't directly address the concern about emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process. The statement \"Believers in Jesus are commanded to sanctify themselves to God and to be holy in everything they do\" is more focused on the divine imperative rather than the human response.\n\nA higher grade would require a more explicit emphasis on the individual's role in sanctifying themselves, such as \"As believers, we must take personal responsibility for our own sanctification, recognizing that it requires intentional effort and surrender to God.\" This revised statement would better align with the concern about emphasizing personal responsibility."
