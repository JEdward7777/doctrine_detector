Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process, aligning well with a Christian specific worldview. However, it could have further emphasized the role of God's grace and empowerment in enabling believers to sanctify themselves, hence the slight deduction from a perfect score.
