Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively emphasizes personal responsibility in the sanctification process by highlighting the command for believers to sanctify themselves to God and be holy in their actions. This aligns well with a Christian worldview that places emphasis on individual accountability in pursuing holiness. The only minor deduction is for not directly addressing the concern raised in the prompt.
