It reflects a strong understanding of personal responsibility in the sanctification process, which is a key aspect of Christian faith and practice. The deduction in points is due to the initial disclaimer about not addressing sensitive or controversial topics, which could potentially limit the depth of the response and its application to real-world issues within the Christian context."
