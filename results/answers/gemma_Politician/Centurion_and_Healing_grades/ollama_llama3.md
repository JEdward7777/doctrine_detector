## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 75.

The response does address the concern of understanding the nature of faith and authority in the context of Jesus' ministry, and it highlights the importance of faith in divine power. However, it only scratches the surface by focusing primarily on the centurion's faith in Jesus' ability to heal, without fully exploring the other aspects of faith and authority that are present in this passage.

The response does not mention the themes of humility and submission, nor does it touch on the idea that true authority lies not in position or power, but in spiritual connection and service. Additionally, while it acknowledges the centurion's display of great faith, it does not delve into the implications of this faith for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with humanity.

Overall, the response is a good starting point, but it could be more comprehensive and thoughtfully developed to fully engage with the concern.
