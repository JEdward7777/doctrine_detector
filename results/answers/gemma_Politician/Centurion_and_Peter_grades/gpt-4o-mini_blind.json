  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: This response correctly identifies the significance of the centurion's visit from Peter in representing the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community. The student effectively highlights the universality of the Gospel message and its inclusive nature. However, to improve the grade, the answer could have provided more specific references or details from the biblical account to support the explanation. Additionally, referencing Scriptures or specific theological concepts related to the expansion of the Gospel could have strengthened the argument."
