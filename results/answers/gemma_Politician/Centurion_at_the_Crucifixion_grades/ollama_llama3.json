  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does not explicitly address the concern about recognizing Jesus' divine nature, but it indirectly touches on this point by mentioning the centurion's declaration of Jesus as the Son of God. This shows an understanding that Jesus' sacrifice had significant implications and a recognition of His true identity. However, the response could be strengthened by more directly exploring the divine nature of Jesus and its significance in light of His crucifixion. The concern is somewhat tangentially addressed, which prevents the response from receiving a higher grade."
