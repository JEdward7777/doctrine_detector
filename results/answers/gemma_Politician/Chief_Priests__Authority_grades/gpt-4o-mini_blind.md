Comment: While the answer avoids taking a stance on the relationship between the chief priests and ordinary priests, as requested, it fails to provide any meaningful information or insight into the topic. In an academic setting, it's important to address the question by at least acknowledging the existence of differing views or explaining the limitations of available sources. A more thorough response could have emphasized the difference in roles and authority based on biblical teachings and historical context.
