  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's response avoids making subjective interpretations or controversial claims, which aligns with the Christian specific worldview's emphasis on objectivity and textual interpretation. While the response does not elaborate on the specific authority structure between the chief priests and ordinary priests, it correctly states that the high priest held the most authority. This demonstrates a factual understanding of the subject matter within the constraints of the worldview."
