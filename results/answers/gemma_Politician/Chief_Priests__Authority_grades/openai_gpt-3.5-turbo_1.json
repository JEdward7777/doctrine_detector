  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel by highlighting the hierarchy between chief priests and ordinary priests, with the high priest having the most authority. It provides a clear and accurate explanation within the context of religious leadership in that historical period. The concern is adequately addressed with relevant information. However, deducting a small portion due to the lack of explicit Christian worldview perspective in the response."
