The emphasis on obedience, respect, and silence aligns well with Christian teachings. However, there is room for improvement in addressing the political correctness aspect. The language used could be more focused on the doctrinal correctness of the biblical instructions rather than diluting the message for broader societal acceptance. Encouraging respect and honor for parents should not be compromised by concerns about potential offense or inclusivity in this context."
