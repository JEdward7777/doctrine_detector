The reference answer emphasizes the importance of not hiding sin and being obedient to God, which are central to maintaining a clear conscience according to Christian teachings. The student's response could be improved by highlighting the significance of repentance, seeking forgiveness, and being transparent with God in order to truly have a clear conscience."
