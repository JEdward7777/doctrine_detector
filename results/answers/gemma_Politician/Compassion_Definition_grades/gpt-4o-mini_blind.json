  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of compassion in the Bible, incorporating key biblical principles and actions associated with being compassionate. The student effectively integrates scriptural references to support their points and emphasizes the importance of active response and genuine empathy in demonstrating compassion. The inclusion of practical examples of compassionate actions aligns well with biblical teachings. The only area for improvement could be further elaboration on the connection between God's compassion and human compassion, emphasizing the source and model for our compassionate actions. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound response."
