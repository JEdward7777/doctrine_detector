* He is "compassionate and gracious" (Psalm 103:14), offering forgiveness, redemption, and new life.

**2. Empathy and Understanding:**

* Compassion involves understanding the pain and suffering of others (Luke 4:18).
* It requires stepping into their shoes and experiencing their joys and sorrows.

**3. Active Response:**

* Compassion isn't just about feeling empathy; it involves active response to alleviate suffering.
* This response can take various forms, such as offering support, practical assistance, or forgiveness.
