## Examples of Compassion in the Bible:

**1. The Parables of Jesus:**

* The Parable of the Good Samaritan demonstrates radical compassion by showing a Samaritan, who was marginalized and despised by many, extending the most care and aid to a wounded traveler. 
* The Parable of the Prodigal Son highlights the boundless love and forgiveness of a father who welcomes his prodigal son back with open arms despite his mistakes.

**2. The Ministry of Jesus:**

* Jesus healed the sick and afflicted, regardless of their social status or beliefs. 
* He showed compassion for widows, orphans, and those struggling financially. 
* He wept over the suffering of others and shared their pain.

**3. The Early Church:**

* Early Christians were known for their generosity and compassion towards those in need. 
* Acts 2:42 describes them as "devoted to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer." 
* They shared their possessions with those who had less.

**4. Examples of Compassion in Action:**

* Ruth, a Moabite woman, demonstrated immense compassion by caring for her widowed mother-in-law, Naomi, during a time of great loss.
* Joseph displayed compassion by forgiving his brothers who had sold him into slavery. 
* Esther risked her life to speak up for the Jewish people when they were facing persecution.

**Lessons from these examples:**

* **Compassion requires action:** It's not just about words or feelings, but about actively caring for others.
* **Compassion transcends boundaries:** It reaches out to people from different backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs.
