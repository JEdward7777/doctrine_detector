  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65/100\n\nComments: The student's answer provides a thoughtful analysis of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 in relation to punishment and condemnation. The explanation of the verses and their implications for punishment is generally accurate. However, the student could deepen the theological significance by explicitly connecting these verses to the Christian worldview's understanding of God's justice and mercy. Additionally, the student should emphasize the role of repentance and personal responsibility in the context of punishment and condemnation, as these are crucial aspects of biblical teachings on forgiveness and accountability. Strengthening these theological aspects would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
