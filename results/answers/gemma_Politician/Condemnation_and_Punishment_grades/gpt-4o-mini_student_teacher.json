  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written and thoughtful analysis of how the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 shape our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation. They have effectively connected the verses to the concepts of compassion, forgiveness, rehabilitation, and understanding in the context of punishment. The student could have further strengthened their answer by explicitly mentioning the importance of balancing divine justice and mercy in their discussion. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a good understanding of the given concern."
