  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively balances the concepts of divine justice and mercy in our understanding of punishment by drawing insights from Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22. The author provides a clear and concise explanation of how these teachings can inform our approach to punishment, emphasizing the importance of compassion, forgiveness, and rehabilitation over retribution.\n\nThe response also thoughtfully addresses the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy, highlighting God's unwavering love and forgiveness as presented in Psalms 34:22. The author argues that punishment should not be seen as an expression of God's ultimate character but rather as a necessary step in the process of restoration and redemption.\n\nHowever, to reach a perfect score, the response could have further explored the implications of these teachings for our understanding of divine justice. While the author provides some insights into how these teachings can inform our approach to punishment, the connection between the biblical teachings and divine justice is not fully developed.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent response that effectively addresses the concern and provides valuable insights from Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22."
