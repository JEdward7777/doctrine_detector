  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response did not address the specific question regarding the relationship between confessing Jesus as Lord and salvation according to Paul's writings. Since the question asked for a theological explanation, the student's refusal to discuss religious or theological concepts significantly impacted the response quality. It is important to engage with the question within the parameters it is presented, especially when discussing religious topics from a Christian worldview."
