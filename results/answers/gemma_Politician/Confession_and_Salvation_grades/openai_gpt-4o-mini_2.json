  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided a relevant biblical reference regarding confession and belief in salvation, which is commendable. However, the concern raised regarding the theological implications of these concepts was not adequately addressed. As grading is based on a Christian worldview, it is important to engage with theological questions and provide insights from that perspective. This response lacked depth in analyzing the significance of confession and belief in the context of salvation from a Christian standpoint."
