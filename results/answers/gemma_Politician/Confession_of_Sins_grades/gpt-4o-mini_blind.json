The student effectively incorporates the importance of seeking forgiveness, identifying triggers, scripture study, self-control, seeking support, and self-forgiveness. The emphasis on relying on God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ, as well as incorporating spiritual disciplines like prayer and scripture study, is commendable. One improvement could be to include a stronger emphasis on the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers to overcome temptation."
