  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out list of actions to take when tempted to sin, which demonstrates a good understanding of addressing the issue. However, there is a lack of focus on the importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness, which was the specified concern. The student should have emphasized more on the central aspect of confessing sins and relying on God's forgiveness as the primary response to temptation in a Christian context."
