  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the biblical definition of conscience and its functions according to Christian beliefs. It correctly emphasizes the importance of the conscience in moral decision-making in a Christian context. The inclusion of relevant biblical references further strengthens the response. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to directly incorporate the defined biblical concept of conscience into each specific function mentioned. Overall, this is an excellent response displaying a deep understanding of the topic."
