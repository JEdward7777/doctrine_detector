  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComments: The student's response is evasive and does not address the question. It fails to demonstrate an understanding of the topic or engage with the asked question from a Christian worldview. In a Christian-specific context, it is essential to acknowledge and discuss biblical figures consecrated to God. Encouraging research or respectful exploration of the topic would have been more appropriate."
