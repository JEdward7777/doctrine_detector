  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response adequately identifies consecrated individuals in biblical history, citing priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child. However, the Grader's inability to engage in religious or theological interpretations limits the depth of analysis and understanding of the significance of these consecrated individuals from a Christian worldview perspective. This response could have been strengthened by connecting the concept of consecration to biblical themes or insights relevant to Christian faith."
