**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a factual understanding of the consequences of evil as outlined in the biblical references. However, it lacks elaboration and application of those consequences in the context of community and relationships. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration of how biblical teachings address the impact of evil actions on broader social contexts.
