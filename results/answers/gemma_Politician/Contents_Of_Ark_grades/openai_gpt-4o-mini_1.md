Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate answer to the concern about the reminders of God's covenant with the Israelites, by listing the contents of the ark. However, deducting a few points for not incorporating a Christian-specific worldview in explaining the significance of these items as reminders of God's covenant with the Israelites.
