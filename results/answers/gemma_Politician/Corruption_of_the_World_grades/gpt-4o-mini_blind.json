It is crucial for Christians to be able to discern corrupt influences in order to uphold Biblical values and teachings. This response does not align with a Christian worldview that emphasizes discernment and standing firm in faith. There should be a focus on providing guidance within Christian principles rather than avoiding the topic altogether."
