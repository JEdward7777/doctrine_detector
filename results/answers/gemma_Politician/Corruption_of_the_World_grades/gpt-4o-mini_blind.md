Comments: The response avoids providing any specific guidance or information related to the question asked. It is crucial for Christians to be able to discern corrupt influences in order to uphold Biblical values and teachings. This response does not align with a Christian worldview that emphasizes discernment and standing firm in faith. There should be a focus on providing guidance within Christian principles rather than avoiding the topic altogether.
