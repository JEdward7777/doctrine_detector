  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student demonstrates a partial understanding of the concept of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible. However, they fail to provide specific examples or elaborate on the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in these covenants. Their response lacks depth and fails to fully address the concern expressed in the grading criteria."
