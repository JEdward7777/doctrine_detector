  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of unconditional and conditional covenants in the Bible and demonstrates an understanding of God's promises and expectations in covenants from a Christian perspective. However, deducting a few points for not directly integrating with a Christian worldview and for hesitancy to discuss religious beliefs which are foundational in understanding such biblical concepts. Overall, a strong response demonstrating knowledge and understanding of the topic."
