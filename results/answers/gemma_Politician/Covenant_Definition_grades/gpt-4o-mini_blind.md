Grade: 40

Comment: While it is important to consult authoritative religious texts for a comprehensive understanding, in the context of a question seeking a specific definition, the student missed the mark by not providing a direct answer. Encouraging reliance on religious sources is good, but the response lacks clarity and directness in addressing the specific question about the Biblical definition of a covenant.
