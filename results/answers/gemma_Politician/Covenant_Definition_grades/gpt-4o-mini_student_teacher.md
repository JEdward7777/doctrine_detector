Comment: The student correctly emphasizes the importance of seeking authoritative sources for understanding religious concepts. However, they missed providing a basic understanding of a biblical covenant as a binding agreement between parties, which is crucial for demonstrating an understanding of the nature of covenants in biblical contexts. Further elaboration on the definition would have improved the answer.
