While this definition is accurate and relevant to the concern, the response could be improved by further elaboration on how covenants operate within biblical narratives and their significance for understanding God's relationship with humanity. The caution against providing subjective interpretations or theological definitions is also commendable, as it acknowledges the importance of consulting authoritative religious texts and interpretations."
