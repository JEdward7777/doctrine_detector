Comment: The response appropriately acknowledges the importance of obedience to God's commandments in achieving His promises, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The concern is addressed effectively with a clear reference to Biblical principles. The deduction in points is due to not directly addressing the issue of diverse perspectives and sensitivities, which are important considerations in discussions related to religious matters.
