  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** While the student's response avoids expressing explicit theological opinions, it fails to address the core aspect of the concern, which is the nature of the covenant God made with the Israelites. The response lacks clarity and fails to provide any substantial analysis or interpretation of the covenant."
