  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a strong explanation of how biblical covenants illustrate God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture. They effectively highlighted key aspects such as God's sovereign choice, the conditional nature of covenants, God's unwavering faithfulness despite human failings, inclusivity in God's promises, and the eternal aspect of the New Covenant in Christ. The response could be enhanced by directly referencing specific biblical covenants (e.g., Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic) to further solidify the connection between the theological principles discussed and their biblical context. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated."
