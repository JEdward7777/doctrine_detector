  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90. \n\nThe student's answer provides a comprehensive and thorough exploration of how biblical covenants demonstrate God's commitment to His people. They touch on key aspects such as God's sovereign choice, conditional covenants, unwavering faithfulness, inclusive language, and the eternal covenant. The student effectively communicates how these elements illustrate God's unchanging love, mercy, and desire for a meaningful relationship with His people. \n\nWhile the student's response expands on various dimensions of biblical covenants, it is slightly lengthy and could benefit from more direct engagement with specific examples of covenants in Scripture. Overall, the student shows a strong grasp of the topic and effectively conveys how God's promises in covenants reflect His commitment throughout Scripture."
