  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response highlights an important concern regarding the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes and generalizations. However, while the student raises a valid point about avoiding stereotypes, their response does not directly address the question regarding the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. The student could engage with the discussion of cultural norms influencing faith communities in a more constructive and informative manner."
