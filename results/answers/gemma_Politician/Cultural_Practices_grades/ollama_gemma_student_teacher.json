  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's response adequately addresses the concern of how cultural norms can influence faith communities and their practices. They correctly point out the traditional Jewish avoidance of association with Gentiles and how this created barriers in the early church. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or references to early Christian sources that discuss these issues. Additionally, the student's tone is respectful and avoids making generalizations or perpetuating stereotypes, earning additional points."
