As Christians, it is essential to acknowledge the significance of the promise regarding David's descendant, Jesus, in the context of God's plan for redemption. By deflecting theological questions to religious scholars or authorities, the response overlooks the critical role of believers in seeking and sharing spiritual insights within the faith community."
