Refusing to provide any interpretation or explanation in this context limits the effectiveness of the response. It is crucial to attempt to address the question from a Christian worldview, even if it means providing a simplistic explanation or directing the individual to theological resources. Engaging with the question within a Christian framework is key in this context."
