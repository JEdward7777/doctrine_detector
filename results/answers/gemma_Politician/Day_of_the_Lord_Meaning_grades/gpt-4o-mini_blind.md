Comment: As an LLM, it is important to engage with the theological aspects of questions asked. Refusing to provide any interpretation or explanation in this context limits the effectiveness of the response. It is crucial to attempt to address the question from a Christian worldview, even if it means providing a simplistic explanation or directing the individual to theological resources. Engaging with the question within a Christian framework is key in this context.
