  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern by providing some basic information about the \"day of the Lord\". However, it lacks significant depth and analysis to fully understand its implications for believers. The response's focus on the literal meaning of the phrase (\"the time when the Lord Jesus will return to judge people at the end of time\") does not explore the theological significance or practical applications of this concept in Christian life. To better address the concern, the response could have delved deeper into biblical texts and explored how believers can prepare for and respond to this event."
