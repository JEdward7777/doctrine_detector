Comment: The student's response diligently advises consulting authoritative sources for accurate information on religious roles and responsibilities. However, it is important to note that in the context of Christian beliefs, the primary role of a deacon in the local church is typically understood as serving the physical and practical needs of the church community, supporting the pastors, and assisting in various ministry tasks. The response could have included a brief mention of this understanding from a Christian perspective.
