Grade: 60

Comment: While the student correctly emphasized the importance of consulting authoritative sources for accurate information about religious roles, they missed addressing the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. Therefore, their response did not directly address the primary role of a deacon in relation to serving others in practical ways as outlined in the reference answer.
