  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the practical aspects of deacon ministry, but it lacks nuance and fails to capture the broader theological significance of the role. While citing authoritative sources would have enhanced the response's credibility, it still provides a concise and accurate summary of the primary role of a deacon in the local church."
