Comment: The response demonstrates a basic understanding of the biblical role of servanthood in the church by explaining the duties of a deacon in serving fellow believers with practical needs. It aligns well with Christian teachings on service and ministry within the church. However, the response could be further enhanced by providing specific references to relevant biblical passages or teachings that support the role of deacons as servants in the church.
