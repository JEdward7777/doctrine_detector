95.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 95

Comment: The response accurately reflects the biblical role of servanthood in the church, mentioning the duties of a deacon to serve fellow believers with practical needs. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly referencing biblical passages or theological principles that underpin the role of servanthood in the church.
