Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate description of the biblical role of servanthood in the church as exemplified by the deacon serving fellow believers with practical needs. It aligns well with a Christian worldview emphasizing humble service and care for others. The only slight deduction is due to a lack of direct reference to specific biblical passages or theological concepts related to servanthood.
