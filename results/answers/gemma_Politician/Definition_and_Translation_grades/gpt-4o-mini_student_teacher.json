The additions of \"advocate,\" \"mediate,\" and \"stand as guarantor\" show a nuanced grasp of the different aspects of intercession. However, the student missed including some translations like \"plead for,\" \"urge (someone) to do something (for someone else),\" and \"make requests for the benefit of\" as suggested in the reference answer. Overall, a strong effort with room for improvement in incorporating all suggested translations."
