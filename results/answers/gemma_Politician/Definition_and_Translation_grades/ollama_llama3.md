## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 70.

The response provides some alternative translations for "intercede" in Scripture, which aligns with the concern to help clarify the meaning and application of intercession. The suggested alternatives, such as "plead for," "urge (someone) to do something (for someone else)," and "make requests for the benefit of," are relevant to the concept of intercession.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or explanations of how these alternative translations can be applied in different contexts. Additionally, some of the suggested alternatives, such as "urge (someone) to do something (for someone else)," may not directly relate to the concept of intercession, which is a prayerful act.

Overall, while the response provides some useful information, it could benefit from more depth and context to fully clarify the meaning and application of intercession.
