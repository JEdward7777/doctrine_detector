Grade: 20

Comment: Although the student appropriately acknowledges their limitations in providing theological interpretations, their response missed an opportunity to affirm the biblical definition and role of angels in the context of a Christian worldview. Encouraging seeking guidance from religious authorities is commendable, but a brief summary or acknowledgment of the reference answer would have been helpful in enhancing understanding and engagement with the question.
