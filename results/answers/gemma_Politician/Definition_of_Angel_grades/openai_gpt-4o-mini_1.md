Comment: While it is important to acknowledge the expertise of religious authorities and scholars in theological matters, it is also valuable for individuals to engage with and explore religious concepts within their own capacities. In this case, the response missed an opportunity to provide a perspective that could have helped deepen faith and understanding of God's divine plan through the role of angels. It is crucial to balance factual information with the spiritual aspects of faith, especially in a Christian context.
