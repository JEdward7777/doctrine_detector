Comment: While it is important to respect various perspectives, in the context of a question specifically asking for a Biblical interpretation, it is essential to address the inquiry with the necessary theological perspective. In this case, providing an explanation of the term 'beget' in a Biblical context would have been more appropriate and aligned with the context of the question.
