However, it lacks depth in explaining the significance of this term in relation to God's love for Jesus and its application to believers. A stronger response would have delved into the sacrificial nature of God's love for Jesus as well as the invitation for believers to experience a similar depth of love and intimacy with God through faith in Jesus."
