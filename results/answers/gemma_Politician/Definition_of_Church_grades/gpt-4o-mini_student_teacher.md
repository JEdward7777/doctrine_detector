## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 75. While the student correctly identifies that the term "church" in the New Testament refers to the community of believers rather than a physical building, they could have provided a more in-depth explanation or elaborated further on the concept of the church as a living and active body of believers. Encouraging the student to explore the spiritual dynamics and responsibilities of being part of the church beyond just the physical gatherings would have improved their response.
