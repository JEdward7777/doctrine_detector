Comment: The response provides a solid understanding that the term "church" in the New Testament refers to a community of believers rather than just a physical building or institution. It acknowledges the importance of believers coming together as an assembly. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly stating that the church is not just a physical building but a living body of believers.
