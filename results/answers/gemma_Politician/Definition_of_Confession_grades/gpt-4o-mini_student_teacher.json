  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student's response captures important aspects of confessing according to the Bible, such as acknowledging wrongdoing and expressing remorse, it does not directly address the specific biblical context of confession outlined in the reference answer. There is a slight deviation in emphasis, as the student focuses more on the interpersonal and growth aspect of confession rather than the fundamental act of admitting truth about God or sins. Encouraging the student to incorporate more direct references to biblical teaching on confession would enhance the response and align it more closely with the Christian worldview."
