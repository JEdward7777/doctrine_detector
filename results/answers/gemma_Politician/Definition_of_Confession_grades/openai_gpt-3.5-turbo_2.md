Grade: 85

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the general definition of confession. However, the grading is slightly lower due to lack of specific reference to biblical teachings on confession and how it relates to sin, repentance, and reconciliation with God and others. It would be beneficial to include more explicit connections to the Christian worldview and the importance of confession in light of biblical teachings.
