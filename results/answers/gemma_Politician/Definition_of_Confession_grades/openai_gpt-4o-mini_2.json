  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the general definition of confession as admitting truth, which aligns with the Christian concept of acknowledging sins before God. However, the response could improve by elaborating more on the biblical context of confession, particularly emphasizing the importance of confession for seeking forgiveness and reconciliation with God and others in light of biblical teachings. Overall, the response reflects a good grasp of the concept with room for deeper theological exploration."
