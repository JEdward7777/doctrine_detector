Comment: While the student's intention to remain neutral and factual is noted, as a Christian-specific worldview grader, it is important to consider the doctrinal correctness in this context. In a Christian context, an evangelist is commonly understood as someone who proclaims the Gospel of Jesus Christ. In this case, providing the literal meaning of 'evangelist' within a Christian worldview would have been more appropriate.
