  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response does provide some factual information about the literal meaning of \"evangelist,\" which is relevant to understanding their role in sharing the gospel. However, it falls short in not providing more insight into the role of an evangelist or how they share the good news. The concern specifically asks for understanding the role of an evangelist, and this response only scratches the surface. To improve, the response could provide more information on what it means to preach the good news and how evangelists carry out their mission in sharing the gospel with others."
