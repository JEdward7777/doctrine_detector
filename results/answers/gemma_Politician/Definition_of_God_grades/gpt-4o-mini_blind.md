Comment: While it is important to acknowledge one's limitations in providing religious interpretations, in this case, the student's response completely avoids the question and does not demonstrate any understanding of the characteristics and nature of God as defined in the Bible. It is important to engage with the question to the best of one's ability, even if that means acknowledging a lack of expertise in the area.
