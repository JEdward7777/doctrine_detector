  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the general attributes of God as described in the Bible. However, it lacks elaboration and fails to address the concern of understanding God's nature truthfully for proper worship and relationship with him. The response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific characteristics mentioned in the reference answer."
