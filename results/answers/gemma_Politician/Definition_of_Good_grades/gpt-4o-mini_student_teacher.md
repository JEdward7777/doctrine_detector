Grade: 80

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-organized response to the question, outlining the Biblical definition of 'good' and contrasting it with the concept of 'evil'. They have effectively highlighted key elements of each concept and discussed their moral implications. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly tying these definitions to the concern of understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making. Additionally, while the student did mention the Biblical perspective on good and evil, they could have elaborated more on how these concepts guide individuals in making moral decisions in their daily lives.
