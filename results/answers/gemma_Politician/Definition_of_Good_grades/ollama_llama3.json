  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student's initial definition of 'good' as morally right, emotionally pleasant, and beneficial provides a good starting point, but it lacks depth and nuance. The contrast between 'good' and 'evil' is also somewhat simplistic.\n\nHowever, the student goes on to provide a more detailed and biblically informed discussion of the concepts, highlighting the importance of righteousness, justice, compassion, and humility in understanding what it means to be \"good\". This shows an increasing level of maturity and theological insight.\n\nThe student's exploration of the interconnectedness of 'good' and 'evil', as well as their acknowledgment that humans are capable of both good and evil deeds, demonstrates a growing awareness of the moral implications of these concepts. This is particularly relevant to the concern about understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making.\n\nThe only areas for improvement would be to further develop the student's understanding of the relationship between divine justice and human values, as well as to provide more concrete examples of how these concepts can be applied in everyday life. Overall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a solid grasp of the biblical framework for understanding 'good' and 'evil'."
