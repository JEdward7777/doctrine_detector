  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the literal meaning and biblical understanding of the term \"gospel.\" The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian teachings. However, to improve the response, the student could have included more references to specific Bible verses that highlight the essence of the gospel message, such as John 3:16 or Romans 1:16. Additionally, connecting the concept of the gospel to the broader theological framework of atonement and redemption through Christ would further enhance the depth of the answer. Overall, a good effort with room for additional theological depth."
