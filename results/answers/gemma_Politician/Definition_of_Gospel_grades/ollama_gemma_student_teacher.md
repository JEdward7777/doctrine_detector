**Biblical Understanding:**

In the Bible, the gospel refers to the central message of Christianity: that Jesus Christ died on the cross as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity, and rose from the dead, offering salvation and eternal life to those who believe in him. The gospel is considered to be good news because it offers forgiveness of sins and a relationship with God.

**Context:**

The term "gospel" is often used in religious contexts to describe the central message of Christianity. It emphasizes the joyous and liberating news that through Jesus Christ, salvation and eternal life are available to all.
