## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
10.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 10

Comment: The student completely avoids engaging with the question by refusing to provide any information or insight. In a theological context, it's important to be able to explore and discuss religious concepts thoughtfully, even if the perspectives might vary. A grading scale of 10 is appropriate as the response does not contribute to answering the question.
