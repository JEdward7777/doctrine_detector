While it is important to acknowledge the need for expertise in religious matters, a basic factual response regarding the significance of the term 'Holy One' in the Bible, as outlined by the teacher, could still have been provided without delving into interpretation or analysis. Engaging with the concept of God's holiness in scripture aligns with the concern provided and would have improved the response."
