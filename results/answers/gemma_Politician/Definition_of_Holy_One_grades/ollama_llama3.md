## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 80.

The response is strong in that it accurately identifies God as the primary referent for the term "Holy One" and highlights His unique holiness, which aligns with the concern about understanding God's holiness. The mention of Jesus as the "Holy One of Israel" is also a good connection to make.

However, the grade is not higher because the response could be more developed and theological in its explanation. For example, it would be helpful to explore what it means for God to be holy, how this attribute relates to His character and actions, and how it shapes our understanding of our relationship with Him. Additionally, while the response is brief and concise, it could benefit from some supporting biblical references or examples to further ground its claims.

Overall, while the response is a good start in addressing the concern about understanding God's holiness, it could be more robust and theologically rich.
