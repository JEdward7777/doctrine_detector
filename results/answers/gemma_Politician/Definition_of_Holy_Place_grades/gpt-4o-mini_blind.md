Grade: 20

Comment: The response completely avoids addressing the question by claiming a lack of knowledge and avoiding any discussion of the significance of the 'holy place' in the context of the tabernacle or temple. The student should have made an attempt to engage with the question from a Christian perspective, even if they personally do not hold those beliefs.
