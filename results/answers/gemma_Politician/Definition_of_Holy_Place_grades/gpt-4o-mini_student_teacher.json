  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student did not address the concern regarding the design and function of God's dwelling place in their response. While it is understandable that the student may not want to offer personal interpretations or beliefs, they could have provided a factual explanation based on the given answer without delving into personal interpretation. The grade reflects the lack of engagement with the concern posed."
