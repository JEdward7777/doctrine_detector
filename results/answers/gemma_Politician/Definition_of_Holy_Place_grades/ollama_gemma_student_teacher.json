  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the significance of the 'holy place' in the context of the tabernacle or temple. However, it lacks detailed analysis or interpretation of the religious significance of the space. The response simply states that the 'holy place' is a special space set apart for God's presence without providing further elaboration on its design or function."
