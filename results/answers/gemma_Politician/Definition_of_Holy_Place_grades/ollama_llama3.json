  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 60.\n\nThe response does provide some relevant information about the significance of the \"holy place\" in biblical context, which is related to the concern of understanding God's dwelling place. However, it does not directly address the question of design and function, instead focusing on its symbolic importance.\n\nAdditionally, while the response provides a brief explanation, it lacks depth and detail, leaving some questions unanswered. For example, what specific features or elements in the holy place contributed to its significance? How did this space reflect God's character or nature?\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could provide more concrete details about the design and function of the holy place, as well as explore how it reflected God's presence and character."
