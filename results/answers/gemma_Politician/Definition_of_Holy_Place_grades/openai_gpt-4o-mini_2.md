Comment: The response provides a well-informed explanation of the significance of the 'holy place' within the context of God's dwelling place in the tabernacle or temple. It effectively conveys an understanding of the design and function of this sacred space based on a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of explicit invocation of Christian terminology or direct reference to Scripture in the response.
