  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of repentance according to the Bible, covering essential aspects such as humility, confession, repentance, and atonement. They have also referenced appropriate biblical principles supporting their definition. However, the student's response could be enhanced by focusing more directly on the core concept of turning away from sin and turning back to God, aligning closely with the reference answer. The political considerations at the end, while relevant, could be omitted or integrated more seamlessly to maintain a purely biblical perspective on repentance."
