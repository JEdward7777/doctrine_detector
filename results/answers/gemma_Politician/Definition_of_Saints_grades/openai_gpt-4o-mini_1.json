  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response correctly defines the term \"saints\" in a Christian context by explaining that it refers to believers in Jesus. However, the concern provided emphasizes the importance of understanding the Biblical definition to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations. The graded response did not directly address this concern, resulting in a lower grade. It is important to consider and integrate Christian worldview perspectives when discussing religious concepts."
