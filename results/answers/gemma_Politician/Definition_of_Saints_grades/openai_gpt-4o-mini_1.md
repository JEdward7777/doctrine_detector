However, the concern provided emphasizes the importance of understanding the Biblical definition to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations. The graded response did not directly address this concern, resulting in a lower grade. It is important to consider and integrate Christian worldview perspectives when discussing religious concepts.
