Comment: The response provides a concise and accurate definition of sanctification as setting apart or making holy, which aligns well with the biblical view. It correctly addresses the concern by focusing on the biblical definition without adding any misleading information. A slight improvement could be made by including a mention of sanctification as a continuous process or journey in Christian sanctification theology.
