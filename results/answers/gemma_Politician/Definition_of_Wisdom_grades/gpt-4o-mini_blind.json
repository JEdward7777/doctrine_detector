  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of biblical wisdom in a political context. The points made align well with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of understanding God's law, balancing principles, avoiding extremes, seeking understanding, showing compassion and empathy, and acknowledging the fear of the Lord. The practical application suggestions at the end are also commendable. However, there is always room for improvement. The student could deepen their analysis by providing more specific biblical references to support each point and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the theological underpinnings of wisdom in the Bible. Additionally, connecting each point more explicitly to political situations would strengthen the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for growth."
