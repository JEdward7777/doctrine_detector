  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of biblical wisdom in a political context, they may have slightly deviated from the core biblical definition provided by the teacher. The student does well in connecting biblical wisdom to political decision-making and highlighting important aspects such as understanding God's law, seeking balance, avoiding extremes, seeking understanding, and promoting compassion and empathy. However, the focus on political applications could have been balanced with a stronger emphasis on the foundational aspects of biblical wisdom relating to understanding what is right and moral, making decisions that please God, and practicing what is true and morally right. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of biblical wisdom within a political framework but could enhance their explanation by reinforcing the essential biblical principles provided in the reference answer."
