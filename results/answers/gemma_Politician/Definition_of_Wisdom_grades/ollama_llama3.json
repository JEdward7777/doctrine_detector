  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of biblical wisdom, as it correctly emphasizes the importance of understanding God's law, balancing principles, avoiding extremes, seeking understanding, compassion, and empathy. The application tips provided are also practical and aligned with biblical principles.\n\nHowever, there is some room for improvement. For example, while the response mentions the importance of \"fearing God\" in understanding wisdom, it does not explicitly connect this concept to the idea that understanding God's will is crucial for making decisions. Additionally, while the application tips are generally sound, they could be more specific and detailed.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding biblical wisdom and its applications, but could benefit from further development and nuance.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid grasp of biblical wisdom and its applications, but could benefit from more explicit connections between these concepts and the concern about understanding God's will."
