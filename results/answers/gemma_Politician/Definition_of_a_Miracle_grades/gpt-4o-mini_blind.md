20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response completely avoids addressing the question and fails to engage with the topic of miracles and God's authority from a Christian perspective. The grading is low due to the lack of relevance and failure to provide an informed response within the context of the question.
