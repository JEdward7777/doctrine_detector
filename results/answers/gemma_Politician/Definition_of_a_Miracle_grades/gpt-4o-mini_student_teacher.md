## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response completely avoids addressing the question from a Christian worldview, missing the opportunity to delve into the theological significance of miracles and God's authority. In a Christian-specific context, it is important to acknowledge and discuss religious and spiritual concepts, which this response fails to do.
