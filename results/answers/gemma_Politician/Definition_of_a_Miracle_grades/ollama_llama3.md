Comment: While this response acknowledges the concept of miracles, it falls short in its understanding and application to the concern provided. The original answer does not directly address the concern about deepening faith and acknowledging God's power. Instead, it provides a general definition of a miracle without connecting it to the concern. To improve, the response could explore how recognizing and appreciating miracles can strengthen one's faith and relationship with God.
