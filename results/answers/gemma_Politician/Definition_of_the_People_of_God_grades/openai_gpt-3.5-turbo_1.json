However, by deferring theological interpretations to religious scholars or spiritual leaders, the answer lacks depth and does not provide a clear analysis of the significance of this covenant relationship from a Christian perspective. Further elaboration on how this covenant relationship relates to Christian beliefs and teachings would enhance the response."
