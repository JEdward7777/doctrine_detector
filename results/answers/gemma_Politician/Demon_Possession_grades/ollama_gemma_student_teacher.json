  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a factual and non-biased approach to the subject matter. While it does not delve into the specifics of spiritual warfare or deliverance through Jesus Christ, it accurately describes the Biblical understanding of demon possession as being the control of a person by a demon. This aligns with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
