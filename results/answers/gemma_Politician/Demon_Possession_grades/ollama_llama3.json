However, the response falls short in not explicitly mentioning Jesus Christ or the role He plays in deliverance from demonic influence. While the response is factual and non-biased, it lacks a clear Christian perspective on the nature of demonic influence and the need for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. To better address the concern, the response could have incorporated biblical language and concepts, such as the authority of God's Word or the power of prayer and supplication to overcome evil forces."
