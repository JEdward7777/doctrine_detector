However, the response falls short of addressing the concern regarding the significance of spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ, which is a critical aspect of this topic within Christianity. Greater emphasis on the spiritual implications and the role of Jesus Christ in deliverance would have improved the response."
