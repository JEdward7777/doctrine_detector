It appropriately highlights the nuances in tone and implications of each term. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be important to emphasize the spiritual aspect of these terms as well. For example, 'exhort' can also involve urging believers to grow in their faith and walk with God, 'encourage' can encompass uplifting others with biblical truths and promises, and 'admonish' can involve correcting fellow believers in accordance with scripture for their spiritual well-being. Integrating these aspects could enhance the theological depth of the answer."
