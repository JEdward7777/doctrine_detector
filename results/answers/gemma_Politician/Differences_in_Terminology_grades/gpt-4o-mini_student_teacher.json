  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the key differences between 'exhort,' 'encourage,' and 'admonish,' considering various aspects such as tone, connotations, and appropriate usage. However, the Christian-specific concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture was not fully addressed in the answer. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes the importance of encouraging someone to do what is right, inspiring and comforting them, and warning or correcting them for wrong behavior according to scripture. The student's response lacks explicit reference to the biblical perspective on encouragement and admonition, leading to a slight deviation in alignment with a Christian worldview."
