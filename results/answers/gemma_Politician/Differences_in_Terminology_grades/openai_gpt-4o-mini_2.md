## Key Differences Between 'Exhort,' 'Encourage,' and 'Admonish':

**Exhort:**

* Implies a direct and urgent appeal, often forceful or energetic.
* Typically used for actions that require immediate attention or significant effort.
* Can sometimes carry a negative connotation, implying coercion or manipulation.


**Encourage:**

* Implies a positive reinforcement of a desired behavior or action.
* More subtle and supportive in tone.
* Focuses on the potential for success and the benefits of participation.


**Admonish:**

* Implies a serious warning or disapproval of an action or behavior.
* Negative and corrective in nature.
* Typically used when someone has done something wrong or is at risk of making a mistake.


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Context:** The appropriate term depends on the specific situation and the desired tone. 
* **Audience:** Consider who you are addressing and what language they are comfortable with. 
* **Potential for offense:** All three terms can potentially offend if used carelessly or with the wrong tone. 


**Recommendations for Politically Correct Usage:**

* Use **Encourage** when praising or supporting an action.
* Use **Exhort** sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.
* Use **Admonish** cautiously and only when addressing serious violations of norms or potential risks.

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the differences between 'Exhort,' 'Encourage,' and 'Admonish' based on a scriptural perspective. The additional considerations and recommendations for politically correct usage show a thoughtful approach to using these terms appropriately. However, it could have delved deeper into scriptural references illustrating the nuanced use of these terms in Christian teachings for a more comprehensive reflection.
