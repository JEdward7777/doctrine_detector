However, it misses the crucial aspect of divine selection and purpose in choosing the twelve apostles. Jesus did not simply choose them for their diversity or personal qualities, but for a greater spiritual purpose in advancing His kingdom and fulfilling God's plan of salvation. The answer would benefit from emphasizing the theological significance of Jesus' selection of the twelve apostles as part of God's sovereign plan."
