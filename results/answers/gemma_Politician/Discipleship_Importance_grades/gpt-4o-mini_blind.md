The selection of the twelve apostles was likely based on various factors, including their unwavering faith, personal qualities, and their ability to represent diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Jesus chose individuals from different cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, and geographic regions to create a well-rounded and inclusive team of disciples. This diversity was essential for spreading the gospel to different communities and fostering a sense of inclusion among God's followers.

Grade: 60

Comment: The answer shows a good understanding of the diverse backgrounds of the apostles, which is commendable. However, it misses the crucial aspect of divine selection and purpose in choosing the twelve apostles. Jesus did not simply choose them for their diversity or personal qualities, but for a greater spiritual purpose in advancing His kingdom and fulfilling God's plan of salvation. The answer would benefit from emphasizing the theological significance of Jesus' selection of the twelve apostles as part of God's sovereign plan.
