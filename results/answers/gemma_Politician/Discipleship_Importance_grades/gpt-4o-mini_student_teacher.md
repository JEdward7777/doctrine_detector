Grade: 60

Comment: The student's answer touches on some important aspects such as diversity among the apostles, but it lacks a key emphasis on the primary reason for their selection, which is the specific call by Jesus to spread his teachings and establish the early Church. The response could have been stronger by focusing more directly on the spiritual significance and mission entrusted to the twelve apostles.
