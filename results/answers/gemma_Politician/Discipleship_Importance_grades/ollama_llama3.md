Comment: The response provides a good overview of the factors that may have influenced Jesus' selection of the twelve apostles, including their faith, personal qualities, and diversity of backgrounds. It also highlights the importance of this diversity in spreading the gospel to different communities. However, while it touches on the significance of the apostles, it does not directly address their role in establishing the foundation of the early Church, as specified in the given answer.

To reach a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the selection of the twelve apostles to their call to spread Jesus' teachings and establish the early Church. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the New Testament significance of the apostles and provides some insightful information on this topic.
