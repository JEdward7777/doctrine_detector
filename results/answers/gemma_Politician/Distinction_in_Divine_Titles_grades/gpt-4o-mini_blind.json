The primary concern is not about being disrespectful or inappropriate to those of different religious beliefs, but rather about accurately conveying the specific name of God as revealed in the Scriptures. The theological importance lies in recognizing the unique identity and significance of Yahweh as the covenantal name of God, rather than a generic title. The focus should be on the reverence and precision with which God's name is translated and understood."
