Comment: The answer provides a good overview of biblical principles regarding humanity's role in having dominion over the earth. It correctly mentions key verses like Genesis 1:26-28 and Psalm 23:1. The emphasis on responsibility, humility, and balance is commendable. However, the student could strengthen the answer by delving deeper into the theological implications of humans being image-bearers of God, created to reflect His character in stewarding creation. Additionally, a more robust discussion on the redemptive aspect of Christ's work in restoring creation would enhance the response. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful perspective on the topic.
