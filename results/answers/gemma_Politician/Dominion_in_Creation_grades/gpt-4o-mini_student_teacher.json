  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that incorporates key biblical principles concerning humanity's role in having dominion over the earth. They correctly highlighted the themes of responsibility, humility, and balance in stewardship. While the student's answer is thorough and includes relevant interpretation and application, it could have been enhanced by directly quoting or referencing specific biblical passages to strengthen their points further. Overall, a strong effort in addressing the concern with a Christian worldview perspective."
