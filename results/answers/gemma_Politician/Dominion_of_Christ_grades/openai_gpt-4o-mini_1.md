Comment: The response provided a clear and accurate statement about Jesus Christ's authority as prophet, priest, and king, aligning well with Christian beliefs. It effectively recognizes the authority of Christ in all aspects of life and the impact this has on one's faith. The only minor deduction is due to the lack of further elaboration or application of this principle in different life situations.
