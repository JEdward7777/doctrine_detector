  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response does not directly address the concern about the uncertainty of \"the last days\" affecting Christian living, but it does provide a wise and accurate cautionary note about the limitations of AI systems in providing theological insights. By acknowledging that LLMs are not equipped to offer interpretations or theological knowledge, the response shows an awareness of its own limitations and defers to more authoritative sources. While it could have explored the implications of uncertainty on Christian living, the response's humility and honesty earn it a respectable score."
