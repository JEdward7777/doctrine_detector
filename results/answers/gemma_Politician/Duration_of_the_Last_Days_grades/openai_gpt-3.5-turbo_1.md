Grade: 50

Comment: The response correctly acknowledges the uncertainty about the duration of 'the last days,' but misses an opportunity to provide guidance on how Christians can still live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return despite this uncertainty. Drawing on Christian teachings or principles to address the concern would have strengthened the response.
