However, the concern raised about how this uncertainty can impact Christian faith is not directly addressed or evaluated in the response. It would have been beneficial to discuss how this uncertainty challenges believers to remain vigilant and faithful in anticipation of Christ's return despite not knowing the exact timeline. Consulting religious authorities or scholars is important for deeper theological discussions, but it would have been beneficial to provide some insights on how Christians can navigate this uncertainty in their faith journey."
