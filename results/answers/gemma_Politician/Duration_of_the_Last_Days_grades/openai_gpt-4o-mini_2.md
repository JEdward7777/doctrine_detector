Grade: 50

Comment: The response correctly acknowledges the uncertainty about the duration of 'the last days,' which aligns with Christian teachings on eschatology. However, by not providing further insights or guidance on how this uncertainty can impact Christian living and anticipation of Christ's return, the response lacks depth and fails to address the concern effectively from a Christian worldview.
