It is important for a student to demonstrate an understanding of the topic at hand and provide relevant insights based on the context given. In this case, the student did not address the question regarding the empowerment of Christians by the Holy Spirit according to Biblical references. Encouraging the student to engage with the core of the question and demonstrate knowledge of the subject matter is important for future responses."
