Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of the Holy Spirit's empowerment for Christians. However, by avoiding religious interpretations and the significance of spiritual concepts, it falls short in fully addressing the concern. Encouraging deeper exploration and understanding of how the Holy Spirit works in the lives of believers would have enhanced the response further.
