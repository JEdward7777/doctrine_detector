  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response does touch on the concern about focusing on God rather than being distracted by material representations of faith, particularly in the \"Lesson Learned\" section where it highlights the dangers of idolatry and compromising principle. The \"Avoiding the Pitfalls\" section also provides some practical advice for politicians to maintain their authenticity and seek guidance from ethical sources.\n\nHowever, the response could be more directly related to the concern about focusing on God. While it mentions the importance of maintaining spiritual integrity and avoiding idolatry, it does not explicitly state that this is necessary in order to stay focused on God. Additionally, some of the language and concepts used in the response, such as \"avoiding controversy\" and \"balancing principles and consensus,\" may not be directly relevant to the concern.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some useful insights and practical advice, it could be more effectively connected to the central concern about staying focused on God."
