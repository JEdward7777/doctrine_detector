The political implications drawn were relevant, highlighting the dangers of compromising principles and authenticity in pursuit of political correctness. The suggestions for avoiding pitfalls were practical and sound. However, the application of a Christian worldview could have been more explicitly integrated throughout the response to emphasize the significance of idolatry and spiritual corruption in the context of faith."
