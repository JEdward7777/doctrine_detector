Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response did not address the question asked about the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod. It is important to understand and respect the cultural and religious significance of the artifacts in question, regardless of personal beliefs or sensitivities. In this case, the answer lacks the necessary information and context relevant to the Biblical significance of the ephod's materials.
