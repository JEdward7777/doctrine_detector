  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that the ephod's design may contain sensitive or controversial materials, which addresses part of the concern. However, it fails to provide any meaningful information about the ephod's design and symbolism in worship, which is the primary concern. The response essentially dodges providing relevant information, which hinders the understanding of the importance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship.\n\nComment: This response could have been improved by providing some insight into the significance of the high priest's ephod, despite potential controversies or sensitivities."
