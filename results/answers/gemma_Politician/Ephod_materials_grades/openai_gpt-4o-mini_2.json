  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates an understanding of the specific materials used in the high priest's ephod, highlighting the significance of its design and symbolism in worship. The concern about the importance of these materials in the ephod's symbolism is adequately addressed in the response. However, there could have been more elaboration on the spiritual significance of the ephod within Christian beliefs to further strengthen the theological perspective."
