Comment: While it is important to approach sensitive religious topics with respect and caution, in this case, the answer provided lacks engagement with the question and fails to address the significance of the high priest's ephod in the context of Old Testament worship from a Christian perspective. Encouraging the student to consider providing a more doctrinally sound response while still being respectful of differing beliefs would improve the quality of the answer.
