The concern about avoiding controversial statements does not justify ignoring the academic exploration of religious artifacts within the context of the Old Testament. A more appropriate approach would be to provide a brief summary of the significance of the ephod and its role in the Old Testament priesthood without delving into personal interpretations or controversial opinions."
