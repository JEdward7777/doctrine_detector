  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** While the student avoids making potentially offensive or controversial statements, they fail to engage with the specific concern of understanding the role of the ephod in Old Testament priesthood and worship practices. The response lacks elaboration on the significance of the ephod and its components, such as the Urim and Thummim. It would have benefited from a more detailed explanation of the ephod's role in mediating between God and the people."
