In the context of understanding Old Testament priesthood and worship practices, the avoidance of addressing the significance of the ephod is a significant shortcoming. A Christian worldview perspective would emphasize the importance of understanding the symbolism and spiritual significance of religious artifacts in understanding the worship practices in the Old Testament."
