Grade: 40

Comment: The provided response of avoiding interpretations or analyses of religious artifacts goes against the core principles of understanding and discussing biblical symbolism and practices. As a Christian, it is important to engage with and appreciate the significance of religious artifacts like the high priest's ephod in order to deepen one's understanding of Old Testament priesthood and worship practices. This response limits the opportunity for learning and growth in faith.
