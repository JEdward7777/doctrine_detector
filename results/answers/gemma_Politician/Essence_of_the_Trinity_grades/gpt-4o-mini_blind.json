  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student acknowledged their limitation in responding to religious or theological concepts, it is important to remember that this question specifically asks about the essence of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, which are fundamental concepts in Christian theology. A grade of 50 is given for the attempt to address the question, but there is a significant lack of engagement with the core of the topic. It is important to seek to understand and discuss fundamental theological concepts when addressing questions related to Christian beliefs."
