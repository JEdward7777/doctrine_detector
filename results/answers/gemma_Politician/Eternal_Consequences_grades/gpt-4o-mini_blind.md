## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While it is important to be respectful and sensitive in discussions, the student's response fails to engage with the question from a Christian worldview perspective. It missed the opportunity to provide biblical insights into the eternal consequences for those who are described as 'perishing.' Encouraging the student to consider addressing such topics within the context of Christian beliefs and teachings would improve their response.
