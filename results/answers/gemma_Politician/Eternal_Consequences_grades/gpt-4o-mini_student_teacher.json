  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While it is important to be sensitive to others' beliefs and feelings, it is also essential to answer questions within the parameters of the worldview being discussed. In a Christian worldview, the concept of eternal separation from God and the consequences of perishing are significant theological teachings that should be addressed respectfully and accurately. The student's response did not engage with the question from a Christian perspective, resulting in a lower grade."
