70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student demonstrates a understanding of the eternal consequences for those who perish according to a Christian worldview. However, the response lacks specific theological details or citations from scripture, which would elevate the grade. Additionally, the student's acknowledgment of the sensitivity surrounding the topic is commendable.
