Comment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian belief regarding eternal separation from God. The concern about the seriousness of this concept was addressed appropriately with a firm statement in accordance with Christian teachings. The deductive points are slightly deducted due to the lack of further elaboration or explanation, which could have enriched the response further.
