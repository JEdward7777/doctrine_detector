Grade: 50

Comment: The student correctly addresses the eternal nature of the Son of God in comparison to human sons as stated in the reference answer. However, the student's response lacks the emphasis on the preeminence of Jesus as the Son of God, as specified in the concern. In a Christian worldview, it is essential to acknowledge and highlight the unique and divine nature of Jesus Christ as the Son of God.
