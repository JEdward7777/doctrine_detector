Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer does not engage with the question from a Christian worldview, which is necessary for understanding the concept of eternal punishment in hell as it relates to God's justice. It is important to address the theological implications and perspectives on this topic as outlined in the reference answer. The student's response lacks depth and critical analysis required to address the concern effectively.
