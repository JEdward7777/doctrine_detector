## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's response acknowledges the importance of addressing concerns about divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. However, it avoids taking a definitive position on the concept of eternal punishment in hell, which may be seen as both a strengths and a weakness. While respecting religious diversity and sensitivity is commendable, it could have been more explicit in explaining why the concept of eternal punishment is consistent with a Christian worldview.
