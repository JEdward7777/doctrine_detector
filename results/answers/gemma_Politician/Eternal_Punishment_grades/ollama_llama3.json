  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response addresses the concern about divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences, specifically mentioning God's justice in responding to rebellion and rejection of His salvation plan. However, it does not provide a balanced view by also considering the aspect of mercy and redemption through Jesus' sacrifice. A higher grade would be achieved if the response had acknowledged both aspects, demonstrating a more nuanced understanding of divine justice and mercy.\n\nThe low score is due to the one-sided focus on punishment, neglecting the redeeming aspect of God's justice in relation to eternal consequences."
