Comment: The response accurately reflects a Christian perspective on hell and divine justice in relation to eternal consequences. It effectively addresses the concern by providing a viewpoint that aligns with Christian beliefs. However, the initial response of being unable to endorse religious concepts could indicate a reluctance to engage in discussions on this topic, which may hinder full exploration of the issue from a Christian worldview perspective.
