## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Christian belief regarding eternal consequences and the relationship between divine justice and mercy. The concern raised about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences is addressed appropriately within the context of a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is due to the initial disclaimer in the response, as it appears somewhat evasive in a conversation where discussing religious concepts is pertinent.
