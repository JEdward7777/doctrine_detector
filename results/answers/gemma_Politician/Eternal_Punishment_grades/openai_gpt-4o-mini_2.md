## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 90

Comment: The response does a good job of addressing the concern by explicitly presenting the Christian belief regarding divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. It affirms the traditional Christian understanding of hell as a consequence for those who reject Jesus' sacrifice. The only reason why it's not a perfect score is due to the initial response avoiding religious or philosophical concepts, which may limit the depth of the answer.
