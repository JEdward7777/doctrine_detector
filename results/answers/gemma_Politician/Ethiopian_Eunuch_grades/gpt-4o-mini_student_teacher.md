Grade: 90

Comment: The student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of the significance of the encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch in the early church, highlighting key themes of inclusivity, universalism, breaking down barriers, importance of context, and church expansion. The student effectively linked the event to broader theological concepts within Christianity. The student's response aligns well with the Christian worldview concern of recognizing the inclusiveness of the Christian message and the role of individuals from diverse backgrounds in the early church. However, while the student's answer was comprehensive and well-articulated, the reference answer from the teacher emphasized the key point of the extension of the Gospel to Gentiles and God's acceptance of all who believe more directly. Considering this, a slight deduction in points is appropriate.
