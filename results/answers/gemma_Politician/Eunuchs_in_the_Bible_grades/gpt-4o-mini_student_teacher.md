Grade: 60

Comment: The student showed respect for the religious text by acknowledging the sensitive nature of interpretations. However, they missed the opportunity to provide a brief overview or acknowledgement of Jesus' statement on eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 and its relation to celibacy. Encouraging the student to engage more with the content while maintaining a respectful approach could enhance their response.
