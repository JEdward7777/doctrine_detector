80.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the different reasons Jesus mentioned for eunuchs, but it lacks specific insight or analysis of the biblical context or Christian worldview. While it correctly suggests consulting reliable religious sources, the response could benefit from a more elaborate explanation of how the concept of celibacy relates to the biblical perspective on eunuchs.
