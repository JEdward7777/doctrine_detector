However, it does not directly address the different reasons for living a life without marriage. While it acknowledges that some people may be born with certain characteristics or circumstances, it doesn't explore the various motivations or contexts that might lead someone to choose celibacy. To strengthen this response, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples or insights into the different reasons people might live a life without marriage from a biblical perspective.\n\nThe concern is partially addressed in the sense that it mentions Jesus' teaching on eunuchs, which does touch on celibacy and its relationship to the kingdom of heaven. However, the response could go further in exploring the different reasons for living a life without marriage and how they relate to this biblical concept."
