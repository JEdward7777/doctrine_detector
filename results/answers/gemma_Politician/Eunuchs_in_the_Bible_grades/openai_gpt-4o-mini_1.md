Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately references a specific biblical passage (Matthew 19:12) where Jesus discusses celibacy and the reasons for living a life without marriage. It reflects an understanding of the Christian perspective on celibacy in relation to one's commitment to the kingdom of heaven. The only slight deduction in points is due to the general reluctance to analyze religious texts, which could have been expanded upon in a more specific and confident manner from a Christian worldview.
