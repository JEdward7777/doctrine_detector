Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively references a specific biblical passage (Matthew 19:12) where Jesus discusses different reasons for celibacy. It shows an understanding of the Christian perspective on celibacy and highlights the scriptural support for different contexts in which individuals may choose to live a celibate life. However, a deeper exploration of the theological significance and implications of celibacy within Christianity could enhance the response further.
