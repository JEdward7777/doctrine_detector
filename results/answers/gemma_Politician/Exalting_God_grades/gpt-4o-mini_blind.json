While the focus on universal values and spiritual experiences is commendable, the emphasis on avoiding specific religious terminology and promoting spiritual growth without grounding them in biblical truths undermines the essence of exalting God. In a Christian worldview, exalting God involves acknowledging and proclaiming His unique nature, the exclusivity of Jesus Christ as the only way to salvation, and the importance of living in accordance with His Word. The answer would benefit from integrating these core Christian beliefs to align more closely with the Christian view of exalting God in daily life."
