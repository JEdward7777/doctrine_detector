  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive approach to exalting God in a politically correct manner, which aligns with the concern of understanding the importance of exalting God above all else. It highlights the need to focus on universal values, avoid specific religious terminology, emphasize spiritual experiences, promote spiritual growth, and respect diverse perspectives. While it does not directly address the biblical definition of exalting God provided in the answer, it effectively builds upon that foundation by offering practical suggestions for how to glorify God in a way that is inclusive and respectful of others. To reach a score of 100, the response could have more explicitly connected its ideas to the biblical understanding of exalting God as a form of worship and obedience."
