However, the concern about understanding the importance of exalting God above all else in life was not directly addressed in the response. There was a missed opportunity to further elaborate on the significance of exalting God in all aspects of life, including how it shapes one's worldview, priorities, and choices. Connecting the idea of exalting God to the broader context of daily living and decision-making would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
