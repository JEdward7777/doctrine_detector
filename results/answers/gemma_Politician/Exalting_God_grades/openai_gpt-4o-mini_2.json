  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The provided response outlines key aspects of exalting God, such as worship, prayer, and living according to His will, which align with a Christian worldview. However, the concern of understanding the importance of exalting God above all else in life was not directly addressed in the response. The response could have been strengthened by discussing the centrality of God in one's life, emphasizing the supreme importance of God's presence and glory."
