  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed analysis of the Parable of the Prodigal Son, highlighting key lessons such as compassion, forgiveness, inclusivity, and humility. The connections made to political correctness were insightful, however, the focus on political correctness may have slightly diverted from the core Christian moral lessons embedded in the parable. It would have been more effective for the student to delve deeper into the spiritual significance and relevance of the parable within a Christian worldview. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the parable's themes and application to contemporary contexts."
