  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the Parable of the Prodigal Son and its significance in promoting compassion, forgiveness, and humility. The analysis through a lens of political correctness is insightful, although the concerns raised about forgiveness and cultural sensitivity are valid. The conclusion ties the discussion together well. Overall, a strong understanding of the parable and its relevance today is demonstrated."
