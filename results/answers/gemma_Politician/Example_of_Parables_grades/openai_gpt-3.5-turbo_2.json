The discussion on political correctness considerations adds depth to the interpretation. However, the response missed the mark by not directly addressing the specified concern of recognizing the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. Connecting the analysis to how the moral lessons from the parable are relevant in contemporary society would have strengthened the response."
