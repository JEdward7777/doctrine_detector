  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a detailed analysis of the moral lessons embedded in the Parable of the Prodigal Son. It offers a Christian perspective on compassion, forgiveness, inclusivity, and humility, demonstrating an understanding of the relevance of Jesus' parables in contemporary contexts. However, the initial choice of the Parable of the Prodigal Son differs from the requested parable of the Good Samaritan, which slightly impacts the grade."
