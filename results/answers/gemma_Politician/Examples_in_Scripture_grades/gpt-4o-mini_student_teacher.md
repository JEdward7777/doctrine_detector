Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer shows a lack of understanding or acceptance of the supernatural elements presented in the Bible. As a Christian, it is important to recognize and acknowledge the spiritual issues and accounts of demon possession as described in the Biblical narrative. It is crucial to approach such topics with a Christian worldview, understanding the relevance of spiritual warfare and the power of Jesus in overcoming these spiritual challenges. The student should seek to engage with the Bible in a way that aligns with Christian beliefs and teachings.
