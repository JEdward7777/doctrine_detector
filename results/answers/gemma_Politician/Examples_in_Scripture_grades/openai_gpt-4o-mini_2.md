## [Answer](../Examples_in_Scripture.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides appropriate examples from the Bible that illustrate instances of demon possession, accurately referencing passages in Mark and Matthew. However, the concern about the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith could have been more directly addressed to deepen the analysis.
