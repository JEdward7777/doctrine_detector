  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response falls short as it does not engage with the question in a manner that aligns with the Christian worldview concern provided. While maintaining neutrality is important in certain contexts, in this case, the question specifically asked for examples from the Bible related to guilt. The student missed the opportunity to explore the concept of guilt in a biblical context, which was the focus of the question."
