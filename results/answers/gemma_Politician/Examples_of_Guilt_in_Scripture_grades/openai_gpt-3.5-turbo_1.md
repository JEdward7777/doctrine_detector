Comment: The response acknowledges the biblical examples provided and connects them to insights about guilt, justice, innocence, and divine judgment. However, the concern raised emphasizes the importance of understanding these examples from a Christian worldview perspective, which the response avoids. Encouraging a deeper exploration of these themes from a Christian perspective could enhance the analysis.
