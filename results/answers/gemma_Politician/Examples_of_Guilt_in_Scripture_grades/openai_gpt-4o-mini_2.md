50.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: The response provides a relevant example from a religious text but fails to engage with the concern raised, which highlights the importance of divine judgment in understanding guilt and innocence. Integrating a Christian perspective that acknowledges the ultimate authority of God's judgment would have enhanced the response.
