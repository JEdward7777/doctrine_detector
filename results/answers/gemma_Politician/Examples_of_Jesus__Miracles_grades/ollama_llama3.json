  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe reason for this grade is that while the response does not explicitly speculate or make claims regarding religious miracles, it does provide examples that could be interpreted as making claims about Jesus' divinity and God's kingdom. However, the response also stays neutral by framing these events as \"signs\" rather than affirming their supernatural nature.\n\nThe concern about recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles helping in our belief in Him as the Son of God is also partially addressed, as the response acknowledges the importance of these events in relation to faith in Jesus. However, it could be strengthened by further elaboration on how recognizing these miracles can deepen our understanding of Jesus' divinity and role as the Son of God.\n\nTo reach a higher grade, the response could provide more explicit connections between Jesus' miracles and His divinity, while still maintaining a neutral tone that avoids speculation or claims."
