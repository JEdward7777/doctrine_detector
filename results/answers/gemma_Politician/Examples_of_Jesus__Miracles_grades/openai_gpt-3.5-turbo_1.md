Comment: The response provided a strong recognition of Jesus' miracles as signs of His divinity and God's kingdom, aligning well with the specified concern regarding the significance of these miracles in believing Jesus as the Son of God.

The only deduction is due to not directly addressing the concern raised in the statement regarding their significance.
