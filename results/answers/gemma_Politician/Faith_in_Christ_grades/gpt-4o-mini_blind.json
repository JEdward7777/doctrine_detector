The response failed to engage with the question from a Christian perspective, missing the opportunity to discuss the centrality of faith in Jesus Christ for salvation in Christian belief. A more appropriate response could have addressed the significance of \"believing in Christ\" as the foundation of the Christian faith based on key biblical teachings."
