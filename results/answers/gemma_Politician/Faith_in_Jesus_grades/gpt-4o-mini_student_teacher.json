  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response fails to address the concern raised about understanding the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life. While it is understandable to refrain from providing religious interpretations if it goes beyond one's scope, in this context, the student could have still analyzed and discussed how believing in Jesus impacts personal life based on the reference answer given by the teacher. More critical engagement with the topic would have been appropriate."
