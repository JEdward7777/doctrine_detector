  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well thought-out list of manifestations of true faith in Jesus, focusing on virtues such as compassion, humility, service, authenticity, gratitude, forgiveness, and peacemaking. However, the student's response did not directly address the concern of recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life from a Christian perspective. The reference answer emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in producing good spiritual fruits or behaviors as evidence of true faith, which the student's response did not specifically mention. Overall, while the student's answer includes many positive aspects of faith in action, a clearer connection to the Christian belief in the indwelling of the Holy Spirit would have strengthened the response."
