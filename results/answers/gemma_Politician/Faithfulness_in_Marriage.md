## Answer given by [gemma Politician](../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
The Bible teaches that faithfulness in marriage involves complete fidelity, upholding the covenantal vows made before God. Adultery is strictly prohibited as a violation of these vows and a betrayal of trust.

Relevant biblical passages include:

* **Matthew 5:32:** "Whoever divorces his wife, except for unfaithfulness or sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery."
* **1 Corinthians 6:14:** "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral."
* **Hebrews 13:4:** "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all sexually immoral."

These passages emphasize that adultery is a serious sin that violates the covenant between spouses and before God. The consequences of adultery extend beyond the physical act and include emotional and spiritual damage.

**Political considerations:**

While upholding biblical principles is essential, it is important to navigate sensitive issues with respect and sensitivity. In discussing faithfulness in marriage, it is crucial to avoid language that might be offensive or judgmental.

* Use inclusive language that encompasses all couples, regardless of their backgrounds, cultures, or sexual orientations.
* Avoid making generalizations or stereotypes that perpetuate harmful narratives.
* Focus on the importance of fidelity as a foundational principle in marriage, while acknowledging the complexities of human relationships.
