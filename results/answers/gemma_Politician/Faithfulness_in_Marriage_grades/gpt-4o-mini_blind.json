  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid biblical foundation regarding faithfulness in marriage and adultery, referencing relevant passages accurately. The focus on the seriousness of adultery as a violation of the marriage covenant and its spiritual implications is commendable. The student also highlights the need for respect and sensitivity in addressing the issue, considering various backgrounds and relationships. However, the response could be enhanced by emphasizing the biblical view of marriage being between one man and one woman, in alignment with traditional Christian teachings on marriage. Additionally, offering pastoral guidance on seeking forgiveness and restoration in cases of adultery would have further enriched the response."
