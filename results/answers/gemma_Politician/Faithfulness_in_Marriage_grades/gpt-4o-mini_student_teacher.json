  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a solid answer by referencing relevant biblical passages and articulating the seriousness of adultery as a violation of the marriage covenant. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly quoting the reference answer from the teacher to align more closely with the given concern. Additionally, while the student touched on the importance of respect and sensitivity in discussing marriage fidelity, they could have further emphasized the biblical foundation of marriage as a sacred covenant in alignment with a Christian worldview."
