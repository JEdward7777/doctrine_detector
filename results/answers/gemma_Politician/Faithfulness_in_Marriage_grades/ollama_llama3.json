  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear biblical perspective on faithfulness in marriage, citing relevant passages from Matthew, Corinthians, and Hebrews that emphasize the importance of keeping the marriage bed pure and God's judgment on those who commit adultery. The explanation also highlights the consequences of adultery extending beyond physical damage to emotional and spiritual harm.\n\nAdditionally, the response addresses the concern by exploring how Christians are called to maintain integrity and faithfulness in their marriages, emphasizing the importance of upholding biblical principles while being sensitive to political considerations.\n\nThe only areas for improvement would be to provide more depth and analysis on the biblical passages cited and to further develop the practical applications of maintaining integrity and faithfulness in marriage."
