The inclusion of the importance of using respectful and inclusive language in discussing sensitive issues demonstrates an awareness of the need for compassion and understanding in addressing marital integrity from a Christian worldview. This response effectively addresses the concern raised, although additional exploration into practical ways Christians can actively cultivate and maintain faithfulness in their marriages could further enhance the depth of analysis."
