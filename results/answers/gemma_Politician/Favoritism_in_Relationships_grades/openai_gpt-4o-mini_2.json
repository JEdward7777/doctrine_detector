It also provides practical steps to promote fairness and equity in relationships. From a Christian worldview, favoritism goes against the principle of treating others as we would want to be treated (Matthew 7:12) and can lead to division within communities. The response aligns well with the concern given, emphasizing the importance of avoiding favoritism and promoting fair and loving treatment of all individuals."
