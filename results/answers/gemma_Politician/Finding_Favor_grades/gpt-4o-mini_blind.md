Comments: The answer provides a general understanding of what it means to 'find favor' with someone in a biblical context by emphasizing positive actions and attitudes. However, to improve the grade, the student could have incorporated more directly Christian-specific concepts such as grace, mercy, love, or even examples from Scripture where individuals found favor with God or others through obedience and faith. Expanding on the biblical principles underlying favor would strengthen the response.
