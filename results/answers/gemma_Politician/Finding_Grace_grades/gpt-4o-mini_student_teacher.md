Comment: The student's response completely avoids addressing the concern of how one can seek and recognize God's favor in their life. It fails to engage with the question within the context of a Christian worldview. The student should have at least attempted to incorporate elements of the provided reference answer and consider how individuals can actively seek and recognize God's favor in their lives.
