  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly states that finding grace in the eyes of God involves receiving mercy and favor from God. However, the response lacks elaboration on the concept of seeking and recognizing God's favor in one's life, which was the specified concern in the question. To improve the grade, the student could have elaborated on practical ways to seek and recognize God's favor, such as through obedience, humility, and gratitude."
