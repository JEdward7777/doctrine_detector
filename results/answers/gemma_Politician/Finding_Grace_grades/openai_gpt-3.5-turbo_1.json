  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response accurately explains the concept of finding grace in the eyes of God as receiving mercy and favor from Him. However, the response does not delve into how one can actively seek and recognize God's favor in their life, which was a key concern in the prompt. The response provides a good foundational understanding of the concept but lacks depth in addressing the specific concern."
