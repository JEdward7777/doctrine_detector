  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively differentiates between \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" by highlighting the emphasis on God's authority in the former term. This aligns well with the Christian understanding of God's sovereignty and His role in determining outcomes. The grading is high because the response directly addresses the concern of clarifying theological concepts from a Christian worldview."
