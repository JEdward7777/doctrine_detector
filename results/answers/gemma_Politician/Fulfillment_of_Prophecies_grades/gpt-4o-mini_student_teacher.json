  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written and generally accurate explanation of what it means for a prophecy to be fulfilled according to Biblical teaching. They correctly mention interpretations by theologians and scholars. However, there is a slight deviation from the Christian-specific worldview by not explicitly mentioning that the fulfillment of prophecy is ultimately orchestrated by God. If the student had included this key aspect of God's sovereignty over prophecy fulfillment, the grade would have been higher."
