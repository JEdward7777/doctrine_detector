Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of how God interacts with prophecy and its realization in Scripture by emphasizing that when a prophecy is fulfilled, it is God who causes it to happen. The original response acknowledges the divine aspect of fulfillment in prophecy but lacks the explicit connection to God's direct involvement. It is a clear and concise explanation that aligns well with a Christian worldview.
