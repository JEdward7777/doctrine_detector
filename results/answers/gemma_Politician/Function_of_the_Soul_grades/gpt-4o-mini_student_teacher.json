  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive exploration of the figurative uses of \"soul\" in the Bible and their implications for human identity. They effectively highlight key aspects such as individual dignity, connection to identity and purpose, vulnerability, transcendence, and ethical implications. The student also appropriately acknowledges the need for sensitivity and interpretation when discussing religious terminology. However, while the answer is insightful and well-structured, it could have delved deeper into specific biblical references or theological perspectives to strengthen the analysis further."
