  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response shows a good understanding of the figurative uses of \"soul\" in the Bible, highlighting its connection to individual dignity, identity, purpose, vulnerability, transcendence, and ethics. The author provides specific biblical references and acknowledges the importance of balancing sensitivity and interpretation when approaching these concepts.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response does not directly address the concern about acknowledging figurative language surrounding \"soul\" leading to a deeper understanding of human experience from a biblical perspective. While the response touches on this idea indirectly by emphasizing the significance of the soul in expressing emotions and personal experiences, it could be more explicit in its connection to the given answer.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical concepts surrounding \"soul\" and their implications for human identity. With some further development and explicit connection to the concern, it could be even stronger."
