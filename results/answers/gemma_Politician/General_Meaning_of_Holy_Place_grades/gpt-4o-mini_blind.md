Comment: The answer provides a thoughtful exploration of different ways the term 'holy place' can be understood beyond the tabernacle or temple. However, from a Christian worldview, there is a lack of specific theological grounding or reference to Biblical principles. While the answer touches on the cultural and spiritual significance of certain places, it does not delve into the unique holiness and significance that the tabernacle or temple held in the Old Testament as a dwelling place of God. Additionally, the emphasis on inclusivity and political correctness without considering the exclusivity of the Christian faith may lead to a dilution of the Biblical concept of holiness. More emphasis on how Christianity views holy places and their significance would have strengthened the answer.
