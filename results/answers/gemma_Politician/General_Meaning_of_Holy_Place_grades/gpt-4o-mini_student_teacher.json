  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides insightful perspectives on how the term 'holy place' can be understood in a broader context beyond the tabernacle or temple, highlighting cultural, spiritual, and metaphorical dimensions. However, from a Christian worldview, the primary understanding of a 'holy place' should be a setting dedicated to God for worship and divine encounter. While the student's examples are relevant, they lack a direct tie to the concept of holiness as being set apart for God. Encouraging further exploration of how these places could connect or be understood within a Christian framework would strengthen the response."
