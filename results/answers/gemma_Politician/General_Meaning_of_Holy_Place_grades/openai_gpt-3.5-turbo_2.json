It incorporates cultural, spiritual, symbolic, and inclusive elements relevant to diverse beliefs. While it expands the concept effectively, there is a lack of emphasis on the Christian-specific context and the centrality of God's presence in defining holy places. Integrating more references to biblical examples or Christian teachings would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
