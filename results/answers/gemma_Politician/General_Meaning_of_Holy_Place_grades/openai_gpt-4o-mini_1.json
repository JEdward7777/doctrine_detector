However, the core Christian-specific worldview of a 'holy place' being set apart for God, sacred, and intended for worship was not emphasized. While exploring diverse beliefs and practices is important, in a Christian context, the focus should remain on places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter with God specifically."
