  "grade_comment": "This response correctly identifies some characteristics of evangelists such as their emphasis on sharing their faith through public proclamation and outreach. However, it lacks a foundational understanding of the biblical role of an evangelist and the spiritual aspect of evangelism. It is important to emphasize that evangelists are not just individuals who engage in certain activities, but are specifically called by God to proclaim the Gospel and bring others to faith in Christ. \n\nGrade: 65\n\nComment: The response shows some understanding of the practical aspects of evangelism but could benefit from a deeper theological perspective on the role of an evangelist within the Christian faith."
