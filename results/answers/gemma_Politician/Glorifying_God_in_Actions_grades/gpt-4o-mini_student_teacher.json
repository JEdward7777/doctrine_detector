  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive list of ways a believer can actively glorify God in their daily life, covering various aspects from actions to internal practices to respectful expressions and serving others. However, the answer lacks a central focus on sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments, which are crucial aspects of glorifying God as mentioned in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to incorporate these central elements would strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
