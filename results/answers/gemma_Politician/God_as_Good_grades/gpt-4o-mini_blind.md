Comment: While it is important to acknowledge the limitations of providing interpretations or religious teachings without proper authority, it is also crucial to recognize the context of the question being asked. In a Christian worldview, the statement made by Jesus holds significant doctrinal importance and should be addressed accordingly. Encouraging consulting religious scholars or spiritual leaders is a commendable suggestion, but a brief mention or explanation within the context of the question could have added value to the response.
