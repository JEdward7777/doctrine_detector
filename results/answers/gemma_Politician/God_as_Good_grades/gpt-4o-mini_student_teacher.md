70.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 70

Comment: The student's response correctly acknowledges their limitations in providing religious interpretations, which is commendable. However, they missed an opportunity to integrate the given concern with a brief, neutral explanation based on the reference answer provided by the teacher. Encouraging the student to show an understanding of the concept of goodness in relation to God's moral perfection could have enhanced their response within the boundaries they set for themselves.
