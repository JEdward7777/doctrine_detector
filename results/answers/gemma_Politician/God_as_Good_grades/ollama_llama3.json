  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 20.\n\nWhile the response does address the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs, it does not specifically address or relate to the provided answer, which emphasizes God's moral perfection and righteousness as the ultimate standard of goodness. The response instead focuses on a general disclaimer about avoiding religious interpretations and teachings. To fully address the concern and tie it back to the original answer, I would have expected a more explicit connection between the two."
