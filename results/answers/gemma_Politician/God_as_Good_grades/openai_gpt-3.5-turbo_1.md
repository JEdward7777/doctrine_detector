Grade: 85

Comment: The response acknowledges the source of goodness as God, aligning with Christian beliefs. However, it falls slightly short of a perfect score as it does not explicitly connect this acknowledgment with the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. It could have further emphasized the importance of aligning our actions and beliefs with the moral perfection and righteousness of God.
