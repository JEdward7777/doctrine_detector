## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear affirmation of the Christian belief in the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate source of goodness. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of recognizing this source in our actions and beliefs. Encouraging seeking guidance from religious scholars or spiritual leaders is important, but an additional explanation tying the concept of God's moral perfection to our daily actions and beliefs would have strengthened the response further.
