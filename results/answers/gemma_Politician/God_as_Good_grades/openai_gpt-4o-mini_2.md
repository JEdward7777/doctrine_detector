Grade: 70

Comment: The response does a good job acknowledging the concept of moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness, aligning with a Christian worldview. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. It could have connected the concept of God's moral perfection to how we derive our understanding of goodness and morality in our own actions and beliefs.
