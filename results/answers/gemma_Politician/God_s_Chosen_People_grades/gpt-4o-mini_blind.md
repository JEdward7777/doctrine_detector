Grade: 20

Comment: The response completely disregards the question and fails to engage with the topic at all. It is important to understand that in a Christian worldview, theological concepts are not merely opinions but fundamental truths to be explored and understood. It is crucial to provide an insightful and reflective response that demonstrates an understanding of the concept of 'remnant' within the context of God's selective grace towards His people.
