Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response does not engage with the question concerning God's selective grace towards His people in relation to the concept of a 'remnant.' The response lacks an exploration of the theological implications and significance of being chosen by God, which was central to understanding the given concern. Encouraging further study and consultation with religious authorities is valid, but in this context, a deeper engagement with the theological question posed would have been more appropriate.
