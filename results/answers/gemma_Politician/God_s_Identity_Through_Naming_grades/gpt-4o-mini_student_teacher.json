  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response acknowledges the personal and spiritual nature of one's relationship with God, which is a valid point. However, the student fails to address the specific concern about the implications of identity and belonging to God in a Christian's life as reflected in the concept of being 'called by my name'. Encouragement to incorporate a more focused analysis within a Christian worldview would enhance the response."
