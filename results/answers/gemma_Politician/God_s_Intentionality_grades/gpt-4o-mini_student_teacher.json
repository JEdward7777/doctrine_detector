  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response that thoroughly explores the significance of the term \"call\" implying intentionality or purpose in relation to God's calling. The points raised demonstrate a good understanding of the importance of recognizing the intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity. The response effectively addresses the concern at hand by highlighting key aspects such as respect for individual agency, intentionality in divine action, responsibility and accountability, distinguishing from coercion, and recognizing unique purpose. Overall, a strong and thoughtful analysis with room for minor improvements to align more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
