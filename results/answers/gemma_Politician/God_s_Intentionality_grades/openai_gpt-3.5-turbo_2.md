The term "call" implies intentionality or purpose when referring to God's calling because it suggests that the divine encounter is not merely random or passive. 

**1. Respect for Individual Agency:**
Using the term "call" recognizes that individuals have free will and are not simply pawns in God's plan. It implies that God's calling respects and empowers the recipient's agency.

**2. Intentionality in Divine Action:**
The term emphasizes that God's calling is not merely an arbitrary act but a deliberate and intentional act. God actively seeks and selects individuals for specific purposes.

**3. Responsibility and Accountability:**
By suggesting intentionality, the term "call" implies that those who receive it are responsible for responding faithfully. It holds individuals accountable for discerning and obeying God's call.

**4. Distinguishes from Coercion:**
The intentional nature of the call differentiates it from coercion or manipulation. God's calling is not a forceful or manipulative act but a voluntary and loving response to God's love.

**5. Recognizes Unique Purpose:**
The term "call" acknowledges that each individual has a unique purpose in God's plan. It suggests that God's calling is tailored to each person's gifts, talents, and experiences.
