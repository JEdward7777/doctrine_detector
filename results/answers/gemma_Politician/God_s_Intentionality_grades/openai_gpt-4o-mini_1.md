The term "call" implies intentionality or purpose when referring to God's calling because it suggests that the divine encounter is not merely random or passive.

Using the term "call" recognizes that individuals have free will and are not simply pawns in God's plan. It implies that God's calling respects and empowers the recipient's agency.

**2. Intentionality in Divine Action:**
The term emphasizes that God's calling is not merely an arbitrary act but a deliberate and intentional act. God actively seeks and selects individuals for specific purposes.
