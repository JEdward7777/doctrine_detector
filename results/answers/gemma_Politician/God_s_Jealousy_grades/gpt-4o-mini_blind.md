Comment: While it is important to strive for neutrality and respect in discussing religious beliefs, it is also important to provide accurate information. In this case, the student could have briefly explained that the term "jealous" when used to describe God in the Bible often refers to His exclusive right to worship and loyalty from His people, rather than a petty human emotion. Striking a balance between neutrality and accuracy is key in such discussions.
