  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and coherent explanation of God's jealousy in relation to His desire for His people to remain faithful. It addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding God's character and His desire for our spiritual fidelity. However, the graded response could have shown how respecting diverse beliefs and perspectives can still be done within a Christian worldview, as Christians are called to be respectful and loving towards others while upholding their own beliefs."
