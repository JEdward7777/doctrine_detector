It clearly explains the process of justification as God's act of forgiving sins and declaring sinners to be righteous, based solely on the grace of Jesus Christ. The student provides a solid explanation of the role of grace, Christ's sacrifice, imputation of Christ's righteousness, and forgiveness of sins in the context of justification. The inclusion of relevant biblical references strengthens the answer. Overall, this is an excellent response that aligns with the Christian specific worldview."
