  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student has provided a valid explanation for not providing interpretations or insights related to religious or spiritual concepts. However, in the context of deepening reverence and understanding in worship, it is important to engage with the significance of God's name 'Yahweh' as revealed in the Bible. The student's response falls short of addressing the concern raised, hence the low grade."
