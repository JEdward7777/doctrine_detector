The response does provide some factual information about the meaning of "Yahweh", which aligns with the given answer. It also mentions God's eternal existence and unchanging nature, which is relevant to comprehending the significance of His name. However, the response could be improved by providing more insight into how this understanding can deepen our reverence and worship, as per the specified concern.
