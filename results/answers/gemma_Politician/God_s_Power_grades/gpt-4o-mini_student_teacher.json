  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While it is important to be respectful of different religious beliefs, the student's response lacks engagement with the provided concern and does not demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental concept of God's omnipotence in the Christian worldview. Encouraging respectful dialogue and understanding different viewpoints is commendable, but in the context of answering this specific question, the response falls short."
