80.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would give this answer a grade of 80. The approach is generally respectful and inclusive, emphasizing humility and seeking diverse perspectives. However, it could be improved by incorporating a stronger emphasis on seeking guidance through prayer and Scripture, as well as ensuring that interpretations align with core Christian doctrine and teachings. Additionally, the student should be cautious about seeking consensus from potentially unreliable sources, as truth is not determined by majority opinion.
