  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive set of steps and principles for discerning God's plan in a respectful and inclusive manner. However, the answer lacks a direct reference to prayer, reading the Bible, seeking counsel from mature Christians, and observing circumstances and opportunities as outlined in the reference answer. Encouraging personal reflection and seeking consensus from diverse sources are positive aspects, but the core practices of prayer, studying the Bible, seeking counsel, and discerning circumstances are essential in a Christian worldview for understanding God's plan."
