## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While it is important to consult religious texts or authoritative sources for accurate information, the answer does not address the question directly about how God introduces Himself using His name in the Bible from a Christian worldview. A better response would have been to reference passages like Exodus 3:14 where God reveals His name as "I AM WHO I AM" or Yahweh in Hebrew. It's crucial to engage directly with the question within the context of Christian beliefs.
