  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of God's revelation and correctly identifies the use of the name 'Yahweh' in the Bible. However, the response lacks additional elaboration or theological depth. It would benefit from further elaboration on the significance of God's name and its relationship to the covenant relationship."
