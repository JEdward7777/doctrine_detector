Grade: 60

Comment: While the response does not explicitly address the concern about God's sovereignty and grace in salvation, it does mention the role of divine initiative in new birth, which indirectly acknowledges God's work in the process. However, the primary focus is on the nature of new birth rather than emphasizing the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace. The response could be improved by more explicitly highlighting the concern about God's sovereignty and grace in salvation.
