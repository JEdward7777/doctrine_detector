The points made about recognizing God's sovereignty, embracing God's timing, finding peace in uncertainty, avoiding harmful speculation, trusting in God's faithfulness, and maintaining a positive attitude are all doctrinally sound and well-explained. The answer could benefit from incorporating more specific scriptural references to strengthen the connections to Christian beliefs. Overall, a strong and insightful response. Great job!"
