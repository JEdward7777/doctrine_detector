However, it falls short in addressing the concern by implicitly promoting a view of God as vengeful and punitive. In a Christian worldview, while God's judgment is real, it is tempered by His love and mercy, with the ultimate goal of redemption rather than punishment. It is important to present this theological perspective in a more balanced and nuanced manner."
