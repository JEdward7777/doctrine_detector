20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided does not engage with the question and fails to address the theological concept of the "zeal of the Lord" in relation to God's actions towards His people from a Christian perspective. Encouragement to engage with theological reflections would have been more appropriate.
