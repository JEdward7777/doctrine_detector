  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response acknowledges that it cannot provide religious or theological interpretations, which shows humility and awareness of its limitations. However, the response does not engage with the concern about recognizing God's zeal deepening believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being.\n\nA higher grade could be achieved if the response had provided a brief explanation of how recognizing God's zeal can deepen believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being, while still being mindful of its limitations. Nevertheless, the response receives points for its honesty and awareness of its scope.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates an acceptable level of humility and awareness of its limitations, but could have taken a more proactive approach to engaging with the concern at hand."
