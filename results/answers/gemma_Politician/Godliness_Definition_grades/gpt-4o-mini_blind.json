However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the centrality of Jesus Christ in the process of godliness, which is foundational in a Christian worldview. The response also mentions the possibility of outdated or offensive language in the Bible without emphasizing the importance of interpreting Scripture within its historical and cultural context. Overall, while inclusive and insightful, it could benefit from a stronger focus on the unique Christian understanding of godliness."
