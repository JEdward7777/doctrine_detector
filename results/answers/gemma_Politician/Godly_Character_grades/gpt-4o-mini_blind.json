The student effectively connects these virtues to fostering unity, common ground, and a just society. However, the answer could have further emphasized the foundational role of these fruits in reflecting God's character and bringing glory to Him. Additionally, tying these virtues to biblical examples or teachings could have strengthened the overall argument. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic, with room for deeper theological reflection."
