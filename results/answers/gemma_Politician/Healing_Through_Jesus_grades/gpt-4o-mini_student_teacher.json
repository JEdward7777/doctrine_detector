  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response does not address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. In a Christian worldview, understanding the religious significance and implications of Jesus' actions is key in analyzing how he approached the healing of demon-possessed individuals. The student's response falls short in providing a relevant interpretation."
