## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response does not address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. In a Christian worldview, understanding the religious significance and implications of Jesus' actions is key in analyzing how he approached the healing of demon-possessed individuals. The student's response falls short in providing a relevant interpretation.
