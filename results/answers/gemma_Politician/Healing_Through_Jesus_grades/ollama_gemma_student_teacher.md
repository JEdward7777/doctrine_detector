## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the biblical approach to healing demon-possessed individuals. However, it lacks specific examples or elaboration on the power of prayer and faith in the process. The response also fails to address the concern regarding the authority of Jesus over evil spirits.
