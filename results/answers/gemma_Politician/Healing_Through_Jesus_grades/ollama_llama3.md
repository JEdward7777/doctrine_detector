Grade: 60

Comment: The response does mention Jesus' authority over evil spirits, which aligns with the concern of recognizing the power of prayer and faith in healing. However, the focus is mainly on providing factual information about Jesus' practice of "casting out" demons, rather than explicitly discussing the concern of Jesus' authority over evil spirits or the role of prayer and faith in healing. While the response does touch on the topic, it could be more explicit and robust in its application to the given concern.
