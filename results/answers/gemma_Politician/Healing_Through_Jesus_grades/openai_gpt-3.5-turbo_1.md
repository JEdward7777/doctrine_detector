Comment: The response correctly acknowledges the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. However, by stating an inability to provide religious or theological interpretations, it misses the opportunity to fully explore the significance of these actions within a Christian worldview. Encouraging further reflection on the spiritual implications would enhance the response.
