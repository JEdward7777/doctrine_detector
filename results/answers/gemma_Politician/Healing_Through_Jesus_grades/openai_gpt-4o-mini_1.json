However, the initial disclaimer about being unable to provide religious interpretations goes against a Christian worldview that acknowledges the spiritual significance behind biblical events. The response could have better integrated the acknowledgement of Jesus' authority with the importance of prayer and faith in healing within a Christian perspective."
