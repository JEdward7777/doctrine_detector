Grade: 20

Comment: The response completely avoids addressing the concern by dismissing any religious or theological interpretations. As a result, it fails to acknowledge and discuss the Christian worldview aspect of recognizing Jesus' authority over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. It misses the opportunity to engage with the specific concern and provide a holistic perspective on the topic.
