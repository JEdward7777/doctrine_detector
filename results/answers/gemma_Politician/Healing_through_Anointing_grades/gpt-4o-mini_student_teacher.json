  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks the necessary connection to the role of anointing in relation to healing in the New Testament from a Christian worldview. They missed the opportunity to explore how anointing is viewed as a practice linked to seeking God's intervention and healing power, which is foundational in Christian belief and practice. Further elaboration and citing relevant scripture could have significantly improved the response."
