However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern about recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice. While it mentions seeking God's intervention and healing power, it could have gone further in exploring how this practice relates to Christian faith and tradition. Additionally, the response's focus on being unable to provide responses that speculate or make connections between practices and ideologies that may be sensitive or controversial in nature seems tangential to the concern about anointing in spiritual and physical healing."
