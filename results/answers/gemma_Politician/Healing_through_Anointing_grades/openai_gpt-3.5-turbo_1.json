  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response accurately reflects the Christian practice of anointing with oil for seeking healing and God's intervention, in line with Christian beliefs. The student appropriately referenced the New Testament in explaining this practice. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly addressing the concern about the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing, although the response indirectly touches on this aspect."
