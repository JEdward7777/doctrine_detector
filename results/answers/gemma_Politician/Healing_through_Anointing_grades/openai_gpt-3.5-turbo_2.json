  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response with a score of 90. This response accurately highlights the Christian practice of anointing with oil for seeking healing, connecting it to a biblical example from the New Testament. It acknowledges the belief in God's intervention and healing power through this practice, aligning well with Christian teachings. The only slight deduction could be due to the lack of further elaboration or contextualization within the response, but overall it effectively addresses the concern raised."
