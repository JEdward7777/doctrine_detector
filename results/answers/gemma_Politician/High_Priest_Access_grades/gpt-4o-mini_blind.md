Comment: While it is commendable to be cautious about handling sensitive or controversial interpretations of historical events or religious narratives, in this case, the student's response lacks the necessary information regarding who was allowed to approach the ark of the covenant and under what circumstances. A better approach would be to provide a brief and factual explanation based on biblical teachings without delving into controversial interpretations.
