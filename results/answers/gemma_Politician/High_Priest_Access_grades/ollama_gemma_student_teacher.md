## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the concept of the high priest's access to the ark. However, it lacks elaboration and fails to address the specific concern regarding the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant.
