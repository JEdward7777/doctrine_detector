It aligns well with Christian beliefs about the significance of the high priest in the context of approaching the ark and the Day of Atonement. The deduction in points is due to the initial disclaimer, which, while understandable in a secular context, may not fully align with a Christian worldview that values the sharing of historical and religious truths to deepen understanding and faith."
