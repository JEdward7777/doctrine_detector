25.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
This response lacks a clear explanation or understanding of why the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt. It avoids providing a substantive answer altogether. In the context of a Christian worldview, it is crucial to prioritize doctrinal correctness and accuracy in addressing historical events such as this. The student's response does not demonstrate an engagement with the question from a Christian perspective. 

Grade: 25

Comment: The student needs to provide a more well-reasoned and theologically sound explanation within a Christian framework when addressing questions related to biblical events. Simply avoiding the question does not contribute to a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
