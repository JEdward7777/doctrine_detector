Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of why the Israelites ate unleavened bread based on God's instruction for their deliverance from slavery in Egypt. It effectively connects the religious practice to the historical event. However, the initial response, while prioritizing sensitivity and respect, could have offered a bit more insight or discussion on how historical events shape religious practices from a Christian worldview. Overall, a solid response with room for further elaboration.
