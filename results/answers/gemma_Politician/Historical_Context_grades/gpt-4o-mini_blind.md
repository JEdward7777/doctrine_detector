Comment: 
The answer provided a solid overview of biblical events that illustrate the concept of 'remnant' as seen in Isaiah and Amos. The connections drawn between the events and the concept of remnant were generally on point. The response effectively highlighted God's selective mercy, preservation of faithfulness, and the ultimate gathering of the faithful in the end times. One area for improvement could be incorporating more direct references and analysis from the actual texts in Isaiah and Amos to strengthen the argument. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of the remnant concept within Christian theology would enhance the response.
