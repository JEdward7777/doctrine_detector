  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response that effectively connects biblical events to the concept of 'remnant' as seen in Isaiah and Amos. They demonstrate a good understanding of the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises. Additionally, the student's answers align well with the Christian worldview, emphasizing God's selective mercy, preservation of faithful followers, and restoration after judgment. Great job overall, but there is always room for improvement in providing direct biblical references and being more concise in explanations."
