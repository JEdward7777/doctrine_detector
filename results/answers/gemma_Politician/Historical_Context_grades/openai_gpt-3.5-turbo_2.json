  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the biblical events illustrating the concept of 'remnant,' providing specific examples and explanations that align well with Christian teachings. It adequately addresses the concern by demonstrating an understanding of the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises. The response could have included more explicit connections to the mentioned biblical passages to further strengthen the argument. Overall, well done."
