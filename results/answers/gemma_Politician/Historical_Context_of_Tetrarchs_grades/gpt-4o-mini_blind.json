  "grade_comment": "Grade: 88\n\nComments: \nOverall, the student provides a thorough analysis of the impacts of the division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies on the Jewish people. The positive and negative impacts are well-balanced and supported with relevant points. Additionally, the student acknowledges the primary motivation behind the division was political rather than for the direct benefit of the Jewish people, showing a nuanced understanding of the historical context. The response could be enhanced by further incorporating theological reflections or references to Biblical passages related to governance and power."
