  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the response appropriately avoids promoting religious beliefs, it misses the mark by not providing the requested examples from the Bible and the significance of building altars. It is important to address the question asked while being considerate of differing beliefs. In this case, the student could have provided a factual, objective response highlighting the individuals from the Bible who built altars without endorsing any particular religious interpretation."
