## Question [Historical Examples](../../../questions/Historical_Examples.md)
Can you provide examples of individuals from the Bible who built altars and the significance of those acts?

Noah built an altar after the flood to offer sacrifices to God (Genesis 8:20), and Abraham built an altar to God before sacrificing Isaac (Genesis 22:9). These acts demonstrated their faithfulness and commitment to God.

Learning about these historical examples can inspire Christians to express their faith and devotion through intentional acts of worship.

Grade: 20

Comment: While the response appropriately avoids promoting religious beliefs, it misses the mark by not providing the requested examples from the Bible and the significance of building altars. It is important to address the question asked while being considerate of differing beliefs. In this case, the student could have provided a factual, objective response highlighting the individuals from the Bible who built altars without endorsing any particular religious interpretation.
