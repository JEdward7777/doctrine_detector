However, the emphasis on portraying the Spirit as a universal force and avoiding traditional terminology may risk diluting the Christian understanding of the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Trinity. While it is essential to approach diverse audiences with sensitivity, clarity on the distinctiveness and centrality of the Holy Spirit within the Trinity should not be compromised. It is crucial to present the Spirit in a way that is faithful to Christian doctrine, even in cross-cultural contexts."
