By avoiding traditional terminology and downplaying the Holy Spirit's divine nature as part of the Trinity, the answer may lead to incorrect understandings of the Holy Spirit's true nature and role. Encouraging a more accurate and clear teaching of the Holy Spirit's identity within the context of the Trinity would be more aligned with sound Christian doctrine."
