Instead, it presents a more dogmatic and rigid approach to understanding the Holy Spirit, focusing on its role in the believer's life without considering broader perspectives or cultural sensitivities. To address the concern of clear and contextual teaching, this response would need significant revision to incorporate the concerns listed."
