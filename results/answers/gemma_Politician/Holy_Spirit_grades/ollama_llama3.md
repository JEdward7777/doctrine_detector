Grade: 20

Comment: The response does not address any of the concerns or emphasize the Spirit as a universal force, nor describe its work in transformation, avoid traditional terminology, contextualize it within existing beliefs, emphasize its universality, or avoid sensationalism. Instead, it presents a more dogmatic and rigid approach to understanding the Holy Spirit, focusing on its role in the believer's life without considering broader perspectives or cultural sensitivities. To address the concern of clear and contextual teaching, this response would need significant revision to incorporate the concerns listed.
