  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"hosts\" in scripture and included the categories of angels, demons, and other spiritual beings, they did not mention celestial bodies like stars and planets as part of the term's encompassing nature. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the spiritual warfare aspect and the implications of divine authority in relation to the term \"hosts.\" Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding but could have provided a more thorough analysis in line with the concern provided."
