* **Angels:** Spiritual beings created by God who serve and worship him.
* **Demons:** Spiritual beings that oppose God and humanity, often associated with evil or temptation.
* **Spiritual beings in general:** Includes any non-human entities that exist in the spiritual realm and are subject to God's authority.
