It also emphasizes the importance of context and authorial intent in interpreting biblical passages. The integration of a Christian-specific worldview is evident in acknowledging the existence of angels, demons, and spiritual beings subject to God's authority. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the understanding of spiritual warfare and divine authority to prayer and spiritual battles in the Christian faith, to further emphasize the practical implications for believers."
