However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on evaluating the health of relationships and striving for open communication and trust as the primary means of addressing jealousy. While the suggestions provided are helpful in addressing jealousy, a more direct focus on the underlying importance of communication and trust would have aligned better with the Christian worldview of nurturing healthy relationships based on love, openness, and mutual respect."
