  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern of reflecting on personal relationships and the impact of jealousy, but it does not fully incorporate the guidelines provided. While it acknowledges the importance of recognizing jealousy as a warning sign for relationship health and promoting open communication and trust, it lacks specific strategies for addressing underlying issues, promoting self-acceptance and confidence, normalizing feelings of comparison, and suggesting relationship strategies. Additionally, it does not explicitly mention respecting individual boundaries or encouraging individuals to communicate their needs and expectations clearly. Overall, the response shows some understanding of the issue but falls short in providing comprehensive guidance."
