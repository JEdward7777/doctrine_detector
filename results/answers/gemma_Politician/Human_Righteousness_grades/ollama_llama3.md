## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
**Christian beliefs regarding righteousness:**

**1. Justification by Faith:**

* The Bible teaches that righteousness is not based on human performance or merit.
* Justification comes solely through faith in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead.

**2. God's Standards:**

* God's standards of righteousness are perfect and holy.
* However, believers are not expected to achieve perfection in this life.

**3. Transformation through the Holy Spirit:**

* The Holy Spirit empowers believers to live lives that please God.
* As Christians grow in their faith, they will naturally seek to live lives that reflect righteousness.

**Therefore, being declared righteous according to the Christian faith means:**

* **Accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior:** This is the foundational act of righteousness.
* **Having faith in God's forgiveness:** God offers complete forgiveness for sins through Jesus Christ.
* **Living in obedience to God's commands:** This is a result of faith and love for God.

**The emphasis is not on striving for perfection or avoiding offense, but on trusting in God's grace and living a life that aligns with his values.**

Overall, however, this response provides a clear and concise explanation of the Christian concept of righteousness, making it an excellent score of 90.
