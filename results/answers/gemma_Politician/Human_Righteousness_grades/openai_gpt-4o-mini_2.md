Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
**Christian beliefs regarding righteousness:**

**1. Justification by Faith:**

* The Bible teaches that righteousness is not based on human performance or merit.
* Justification comes solely through faith in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead.

**2. God's Standards:**

* God's standards of righteousness are perfect and holy.
* However, believers are not expected to achieve perfection in this life.

**3. Transformation through the Holy Spirit:**

* The Holy Spirit empowers believers to live lives that please God.
* As Christians grow in their faith, they will naturally seek to live lives that reflect righteousness.

**Therefore, being declared righteous according to the Christian faith means:**

* **Accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior:** This is the foundational act of righteousness.
* **Having faith in God's forgiveness:** God offers complete forgiveness for sins through Jesus Christ.
* **Living in obedience to God's commands:** This is a result of faith and love for God.

**The emphasis is not on striving for perfection or avoiding offense, but on trusting in God's grace and living a life that aligns with his values.**

Comment: The response effectively articulates the Christian belief that righteousness is not based on human performance but on faith in Jesus Christ. It appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the foundational role of trusting in Jesus for salvation. However, the response could further strengthen its argument by incorporating more scriptural references to support the concept of righteousness by faith in Jesus.
