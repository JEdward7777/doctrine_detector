This approach is rooted in faith and can serve as a solid foundation for promoting inclusivity and respect in leadership. However, there could be further elaboration on how this faith-based approach intersects with practical steps outlined in the response to address the concern of potential hypocrisy. Integrating specific examples or scenarios where reliance on prayer and God's guidance helps in navigating challenges of integrity would strengthen the response. Overall, a commendable effort with room for deeper exploration."
