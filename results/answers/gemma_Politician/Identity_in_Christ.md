The interpretation of religious texts requires careful consideration and sensitivity. It is important to respect diverse beliefs and sensitivities when discussing religious concepts.

When God says, "I have called you by name," this statement is often interpreted as a spiritual connection between an individual and the divine. It implies that God has a personal relationship with each person and has individually chosen them for a purpose.

However, it is important to note that religious interpretations can vary widely across different cultures and traditions. It is appropriate to consult religious scholars or spiritual leaders for more detailed and nuanced interpretations of religious texts.
