  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid interpretation of the biblical passage \"I have called you by name,\" emphasizing the personal relationship between God and each individual. It aligns well with the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ from a Christian worldview. The mention of consulting religious scholars or spiritual leaders adds depth to the discussion. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful response."
