## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While it is understandable that the student may feel uncomfortable providing interpretations of religious texts, the answer does not address the question in a meaningful way. In a Christian worldview, it is important to engage with and understand the teachings of the Bible, including its illustrations of the consequences of idolatry. Encouraging consultation with religious authorities or scholars is appropriate, but a more direct engagement with the question would have been more beneficial.
