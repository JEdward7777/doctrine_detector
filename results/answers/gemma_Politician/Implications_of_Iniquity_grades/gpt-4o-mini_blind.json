The points made are coherent and align well with Christian principles of compassion, justice, and reconciliation. However, to enhance the answer, the student could have provided more specific references to relevant Bible verses or theological concepts to strengthen the doctrinal correctness. Additionally, tying in the concept of sin and repentance could deepen the theological reflection on iniquity. Overall, a commendable response."
