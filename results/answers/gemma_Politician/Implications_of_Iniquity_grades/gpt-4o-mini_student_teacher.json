  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful explanation of how understanding iniquity as \"harmful acts\" can influence Christian behavior toward others. Their points on promoting compassion, guiding interactions, promoting social justice, transforming communities, embracing cultural sensitivity, and avoiding bias were well articulated and aligned with Christian principles. However, the student could have tied their points more directly to the practice of forgiveness and reconciliation within the Christian community as specified in the concern."
