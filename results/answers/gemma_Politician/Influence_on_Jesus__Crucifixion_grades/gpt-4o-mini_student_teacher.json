  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response, though respectful in its approach, lacks depth and analysis. It fails to engage with the Christian worldview and misses the opportunity to explore the relevance of the conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders for contemporary faith. Encouraging more discussion around the character traits of the Sadducees and Pharisees in light of Christian teachings would have improved the response."
