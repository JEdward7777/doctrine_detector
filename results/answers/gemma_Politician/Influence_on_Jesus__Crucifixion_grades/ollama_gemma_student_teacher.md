## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the conflict between Jesus and religious leaders, but fails to provide sufficient evidence or analysis to support their claim regarding the motivations of the Sadducees and Pharisees. The response lacks depth and fails to engage with the specified concern of understanding the conflict in the context of contemporary faith.
