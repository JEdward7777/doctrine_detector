  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The response inaccurately attributes motives to the Sadducees and Pharisees without sufficient biblical evidence or historical context. It is important to avoid making presumptuous claims about historical figures, especially within the context of religious teachings. This response lacks a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics between Jesus and the religious leaders of his time. It is essential to approach such discussions with respect and a deeper understanding of biblical narrative and historical context."
