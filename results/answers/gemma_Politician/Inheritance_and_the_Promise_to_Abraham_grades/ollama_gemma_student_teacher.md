## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the basic premise of the covenant between God and Abraham, but lacks elaboration or theological insight. While it avoids making interpretive claims, it could benefit from referencing relevant biblical passages or historical accounts to support the claim.
