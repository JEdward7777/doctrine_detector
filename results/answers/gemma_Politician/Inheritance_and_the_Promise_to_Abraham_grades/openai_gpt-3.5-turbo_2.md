Comment: The initial response correctly refers to God's promise to inherit the land of Canaan to Abraham, demonstrating an awareness of biblical history. However, the response could have gone further in explaining the significance of this covenant in relation to believers, such as highlighting the idea of spiritual inheritance through faith in Christ as outlined in the New Testament.
