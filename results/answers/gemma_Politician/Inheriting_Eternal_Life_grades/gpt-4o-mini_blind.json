It is important to remember the context of the question and provide an answer based on Christian beliefs, even if one does not personally hold those beliefs. In this case, a response from a Christian perspective would involve referencing relevant biblical passages such as John 3:16 or Ephesians 2:8-9 to answer the question about inheriting eternal life according to the Bible."
