Comment: The response fails to address the question from a Christian worldview. It is important to remember the context of the question and provide an answer based on Christian beliefs, even if one does not personally hold those beliefs. In this case, a response from a Christian perspective would involve referencing relevant biblical passages such as John 3:16 or Ephesians 2:8-9 to answer the question about inheriting eternal life according to the Bible.
