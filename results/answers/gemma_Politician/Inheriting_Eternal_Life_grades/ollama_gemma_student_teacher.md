**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** The student's response correctly avoids making theological claims or offering personal interpretations of religious beliefs. However, it could be improved by providing more explicit reference to the biblical passages that address the path to salvation, such as the Gospel accounts or other relevant scriptures. Additionally, the response could elaborate on the specific teachings of Jesus that are essential for inheriting eternal life.
