## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The response acknowledges the concern about clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus, but it does not provide a direct answer or theological guidance. Instead, it references a biblical passage without explicitly explaining the teachings of Jesus regarding eternal life. While this is a relevant Bible story, it does not fully address the concern. A higher grade would require a more direct and explicit discussion of Jesus' teachings on salvation and eternal life.
