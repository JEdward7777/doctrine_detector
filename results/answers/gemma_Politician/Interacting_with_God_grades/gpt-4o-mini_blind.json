  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-structured and thoughtful answer that emphasizes inclusivity, spiritual principles, clarity in language, consulting diverse perspectives, avoiding speculation, and prioritizing respect and sensitivity. However, the answer lacks a strong foundation in Christian doctrine and teachings. It does not explicitly address how our responses to God can impact His will for our lives from a Christian worldview perspective. Incorporating specific biblical references and theological insights would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
