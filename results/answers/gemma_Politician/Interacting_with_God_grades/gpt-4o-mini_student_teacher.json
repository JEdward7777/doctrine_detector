  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the student provided valuable guidelines for discussing God's will and relationships, the answer did not directly address the impact of our responses to God on His will for our lives. Encouragement to align with God's will through obedience, faith, and worship was beneficial, but the response could have been stronger if it directly connected the guidelines provided to the specific question asked. More clarity and focus on the relationship between our choices and God's will would improve the grade."
