While the language is general and could be applied universally, it lacks specificity and precision. Additionally, the response does not consult diverse perspectives or avoid speculation and unfounded assumptions.\n\nThe response does, however, prioritize respect and sensitivity by acknowledging that our choices can impact our relationship with God. It also touches on the importance of aligning ourselves with His will through obedience, faith, and worship, which is a key principle in Christian theology.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be beneficial to explicitly address how the concern relates to God's universality and inclusivity, provide more specific examples or scriptural backing, and consider diverse perspectives."
