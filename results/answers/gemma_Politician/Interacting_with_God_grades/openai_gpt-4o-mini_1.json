It does not explicitly make assumptions about God's will based on human preferences or traditions. However, there could be a bit more clarity on how choices specifically influence one's relationship with God and the unfolding of His plans from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could benefit from referencing biblical passages or theological concepts to further support the argument."
