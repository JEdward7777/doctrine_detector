Comment: While it is important to consult religious texts and scholars for accurate information, as a student engaging in a discussion on Christian teachings, it is expected to at least attempt to provide an answer based on the knowledge or understanding you have. In this case, providing a brief explanation or definition of "the last day" as referred to in Christian teaching would have shown an effort to engage with the question.
