70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** The student's response correctly avoids offering subjective interpretations or theological information, which aligns with the Christian worldview concern of avoiding unauthorized or speculative teachings. However, it could benefit from more explicitly referencing the concept of judgment in relation to the "last day," as suggested by the reference answer.
