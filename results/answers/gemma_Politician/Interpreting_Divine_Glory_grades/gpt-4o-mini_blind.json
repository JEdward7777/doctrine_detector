  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The answer provides a general overview of the concept of \"divine glory\" in the context of worship, acknowledging its awe-inspiring qualities and importance in acknowledging God's greatness. However, the response lacks depth in exploring the unique Christian understanding of divine glory and its significance in worship. It also falls short in delving into the biblical basis for divine glory and its role in shaping the worship practices of believers. The answer would benefit from incorporating more specific Christian theological insights and references to Scripture to garner a higher grade."
