I'd rate this response an 85.

The LLM response provides a clear and concise explanation of "divine glory" in worship, emphasizing its inherent majesty and splendor. It also addresses concerns about inclusivity, sensitivity, and respect for diverse beliefs and practices. The interpretation section effectively highlights the transcendent nature of God's glory, evoking awe and wonder.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:

* While the LLM response touches on the importance of recognizing God's glory in worship, it doesn't explicitly connect this understanding to the concern about expressing reverence and awe towards Him.
* The response could benefit from more biblical references or supporting passages to strengthen its claims.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of "divine glory" in worship and addresses relevant concerns. With some additional development and explicit connections to the concern, it could be even stronger.
