  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful response that considers different perspectives and emphasizes the metaphorical and symbolic meanings behind the term \"high.\" However, it lacks specific reference to the Christian worldview and the concept of God's supremacy that is highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to further integrate Christian teachings on God's nature into their response would enhance its alignment with a Christian-specific worldview."
