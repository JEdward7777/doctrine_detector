  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response does a good job of addressing the concern by emphasizing the metaphorical use of the term \"high\" in describing God's nature. It avoids misconceptions and provides a clear explanation in line with a Christian worldview. The only potential improvement could be to explicitly tie the explanation back to the broader points made in the response, reinforcing the importance of considering symbolic and metaphorical meanings in understanding God's nature."
