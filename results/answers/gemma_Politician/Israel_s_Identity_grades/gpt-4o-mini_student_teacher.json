  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 20.\n\nWhile it is important to be respectful of diverse perspectives and avoid contentious discussions, in the context of a question specifically asking about the biblical origin and significance of a name like 'Israel,' it is appropriate and necessary to provide an answer based on biblical context. The student's response did not demonstrate an understanding of the significance of biblical names and their meanings, which was the specified concern in this case. It is important for the student to engage with the assigned topic in a way that respects the academic and religious context provided."
