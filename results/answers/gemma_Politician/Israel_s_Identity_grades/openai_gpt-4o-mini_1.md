Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the biblical significance of the name 'Israel' as derived from the story of Jacob in the Bible. It effectively addresses the concern by showcasing an understanding of biblical names and their meanings within a Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is due to the lack of further elaboration or deeper theological reflection on the significance of this name.
