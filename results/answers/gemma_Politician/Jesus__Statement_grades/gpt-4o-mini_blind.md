## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
10.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 10

Comment: While the student's response is respectful and acknowledges their limitations in providing theological insights, they missed an opportunity to at least briefly address the significance of Jesus' statement in the Bible. Encouraging seeking guidance from religious authorities is good, but a brief factual explanation could have added value to the response.
