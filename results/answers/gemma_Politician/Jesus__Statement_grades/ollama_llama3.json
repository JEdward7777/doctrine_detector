  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges that Jesus' statement about being the Resurrection and the Life is important for faith and theological understanding, it does not provide any meaningful interpretation or insight into what Jesus meant by his declaration. Instead, it simply states that Jesus is the source of resurrection and the one who causes people to come back to life, which is a fairly superficial explanation.\n\nThe response also does not engage with the concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, instead simply stating a general fact without providing any theological or biblical context. To receive a higher grade, I would expect a more thoughtful and nuanced analysis of Jesus' statement, as well as some engagement with the concern about his identity and role in resurrection.\n\nComment: While this response provides some basic information about Jesus' statement, it does not demonstrate a deep understanding of the theological significance of his declaration or its implications for faith."
