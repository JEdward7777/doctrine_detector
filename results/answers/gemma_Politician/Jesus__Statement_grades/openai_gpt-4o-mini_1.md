Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided fails to address the concern raised about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection from a Christian specific worldview. It is essential to engage with the theological implications and significance of Jesus' statement in order to deepen understanding and faith. The response should have offered insights on Jesus' divinity and role as the source of resurrection based on Christian teachings.
