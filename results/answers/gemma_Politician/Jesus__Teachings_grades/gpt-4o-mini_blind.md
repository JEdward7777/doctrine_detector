40.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this response as 40. While the student appropriately emphasizes the importance of relying on reliable historical sources and religious texts, they fail to provide any analysis or explanation regarding how Jesus used the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings. In this case, providing a brief explanation based on the teachings of the Bible could have enhanced the quality of the response. It is important for the student to engage with the question within the parameters of the topic while still maintaining a respectful approach to religious beliefs.
