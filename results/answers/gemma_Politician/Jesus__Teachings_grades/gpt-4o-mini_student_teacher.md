Grade: 50

Comment: While it is important to rely on reliable sources for historical accuracy, the student could have referenced the Bible as a reliable religious text in this context to provide a more comprehensive answer. Encouraging the student to integrate biblical references would have strengthened their response from a Christian specific worldview.
