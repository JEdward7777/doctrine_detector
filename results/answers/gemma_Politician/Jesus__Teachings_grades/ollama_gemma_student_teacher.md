80.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 80/100**

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the general concept of Jesus using 'amen' to emphasize his teachings. However, it lacks specific examples or textual references to support the claim. A stronger response would include citations from scripture or other reliable sources to bolster the argument.
