  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does not directly address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, but it does indirectly acknowledge the importance of reliable sources for understanding His teachings. The mention of \"related teachings\" also hints at an awareness of Jesus' authority as a teacher.\n\nHowever, the response could be more explicit in its recognition of Jesus' authority, especially since it is given a specific concern about recognizing that authority. Additionally, the response does not provide any direct evidence or scriptural backing for the authority of Jesus' words and teachings, which would have strengthened the argument.\n\nOverall, while the response shows some awareness of the importance of reliable sources and the teachings of Jesus, it could be more explicit and scripturally grounded in its recognition of His authority."
