  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response accurately recognizes the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture by acknowledging his use of phrases like \"and I say to you\" to emphasize the truth of His teachings. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the importance of Jesus' words in the Christian worldview. The deduction from a perfect score is due to the lack of direct reference to specific Scriptures or theological explanations that could have further supported the point made."
