Grade: 95

Comment: The response accurately recognizes the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture by acknowledging his use of phrases like "and I say to you" to emphasize the truth of His teachings. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the importance of Jesus' words in the Christian worldview. The deduction from a perfect score is due to the lack of direct reference to specific Scriptures or theological explanations that could have further supported the point made.
