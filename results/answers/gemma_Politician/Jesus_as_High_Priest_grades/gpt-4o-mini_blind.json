  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's response fails to engage with the question and shows a lack of understanding of the subject matter. In discussing Jesus' role in relation to the priesthood and the significance for sacrifices made by human priests, a deeper theological exploration is required. This response reflects a reluctance to discuss religious or theological topics, which is not conducive to providing a comprehensive answer within a Christian worldview."
