80.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** The student's response correctly identifies Jesus as the great high priest and explains his role as intercessor and sacrifice. However, the response lacks elaboration on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in relation to human priesthood, which could have enhanced the clarity of the answer.
