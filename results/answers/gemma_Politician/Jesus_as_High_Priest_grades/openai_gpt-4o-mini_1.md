## Question [Jesus as High Priest](../../../questions/Jesus_as_High_Priest.md)
How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

Grade: 95

Comment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood within the Christian faith. It accurately explains how Jesus is seen as the ultimate sacrifice for sin and the mediator between God and humanity. The only minor deduction is due to the initial reluctance to engage with religious or theological concepts, which in this case, were necessary for a complete answer.
