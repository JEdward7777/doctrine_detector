Grade: 90

Comment: The response acknowledges the theological implications of Jesus fulfilling the role of a high priest, highlighting his sacrificial offering for the forgiveness of sins. The answer aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the redemptive work of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice. The deduction in points is due to the initial refusal to engage in religious interpretations, which could have been addressed more diplomatically or in a manner that respects the significance of theological discussions within Christianity.
