In this case, the answer falls short of addressing the question from a Christian worldview and navigating the theological significance of calling Jesus \"Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also referred to as \"lord.\" Encouraging the student to analyze the implications of conflicting lordships and to provide a biblically founded response would enhance the depth and relevance of the answer."
