  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While it is understandable that the student may want to avoid controversial political issues, in a Christian worldview, it is important to be able to articulate the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The student could have focused solely on the theological implications of the phrase 'Jesus is Lord' without wading into specific political matters. Encouraging respectful discourse while affirming the unique authority of Jesus would have aligned better with a Christian perspective."
