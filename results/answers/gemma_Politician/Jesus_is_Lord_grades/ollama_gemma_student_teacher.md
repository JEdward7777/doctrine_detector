**Grade: 80/100**

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the need to clarify the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or analogies to illustrate the concept of Jesus' divine authority. Additionally, the response could address the concern of political leaders being referred to as "lords," although it does not need to delve into specific political contexts.
