However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing how the statement \"Jesus is the Son of God\" could be translated into a Muslim context. It would have been more beneficial for the student to offer a direct translation or an alternative understanding within Islamic beliefs without diluting the doctrinal differences between Christianity and Islam."
