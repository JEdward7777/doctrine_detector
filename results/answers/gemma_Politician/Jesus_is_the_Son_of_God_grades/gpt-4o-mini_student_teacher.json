  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer falls short of the teacher's reference answer by not directly translating \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context while maintaining the original terminology. While the student attempts to offer an explanation, it deviates from the direct translation and clear teaching that the teacher emphasized. The response lacks Biblical accuracy and does not effectively explain the significance of the original text in a Muslim context."
