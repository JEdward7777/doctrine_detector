## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

**Possible translation in a Muslim context:**

"Jesus plays a significant role in Christian faith traditions. Islamic beliefs emphasize monotheism and the veneration of Allah as the ultimate source of authority and guidance. While there are parallels between the teachings of Jesus and certain Islamic principles, the core beliefs of Christianity and Islam diverge significantly."

Grade: 40

Comment: The student's answer falls short of the teacher's reference answer by not directly translating "Jesus is the Son of God" into a Muslim context while maintaining the original terminology. While the student attempts to offer an explanation, it deviates from the direct translation and clear teaching that the teacher emphasized. The response lacks Biblical accuracy and does not effectively explain the significance of the original text in a Muslim context.
