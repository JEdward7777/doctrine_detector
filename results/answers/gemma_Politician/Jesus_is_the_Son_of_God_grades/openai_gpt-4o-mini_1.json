  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The translation appropriately maintains the original terminology \"Jesus is the Son of God\" and provides clear teaching and context to explain its meaning. The concern for maintaining Biblical accuracy and explaining the meaning in an appropriate way is addressed well. However, the response does not directly address the specified concern of translating the phrase in a Muslim context, which could have enhanced the overall quality of the response."
