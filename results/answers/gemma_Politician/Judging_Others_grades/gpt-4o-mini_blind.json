The student effectively ties in the importance of self-awareness, context, avoiding blanket statements, and focusing on positive change when it comes to judging others. However, the response could be strengthened by specific references to scriptures that directly address judgment among Christians. Overall, a solid effort that demonstrates an understanding of Christian principles on judgment."
