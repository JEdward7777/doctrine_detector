  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of biblical principles regarding judgment and has made efforts to apply them to the concept of political correctness within relationships in the Christian community. However, the student's answer could be improved by directly referencing specific Bible verses that speak to the importance of not judging others harshly or condemning them, as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, the student could have provided more emphasis on the need for encouragement and support in helping one another grow in faith. With some refinement and specific biblical references, the student's answer could better align with the Christian worldview on approaching relationships within the Christian community."
