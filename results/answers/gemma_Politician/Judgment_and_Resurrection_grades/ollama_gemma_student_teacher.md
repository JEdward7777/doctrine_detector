## Grade: 80/100

**Comment:** While the student correctly avoids making claims about their own knowledge limitations, they could have elaborated on why the event in question is beyond their knowledge scope. Additionally, the response lacks specificity in describing the events associated with the 'day of Yahweh' or 'day of the Lord', thereby receiving a slightly lower grade despite being factually accurate.
