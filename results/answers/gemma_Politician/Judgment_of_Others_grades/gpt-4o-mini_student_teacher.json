  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response that aligns closely with the Christian teaching of humility and self-reflection before pointing out the faults of others. They integrated relevant Biblical principles and demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of practicing forgiveness and using gentle words. However, the answer could have been further strengthened by directly referencing the specific Bible verse (Luke 6:41-42) provided in the reference answer from the teacher. Overall, a strong effort with room for a bit more scriptural integration."
