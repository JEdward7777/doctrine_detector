Grade: 85

Comment: The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful approach to the question, considering the cultural implications of translating the concept of "Kingdom of God" for cultures with no concept of kingdoms. The suggested rephrasings are well thought out and offer valid alternatives that maintain the spiritual essence of the original term. The focus on balancing sensitivity and clarity is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to also emphasize the theological significance of the "Kingdom of God" as a central concept in Christian doctrine, not simply as a cultural adaptation. Bringing in more theological depth to the discussion would enhance the answer even further.
