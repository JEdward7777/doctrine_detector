However, from a Christian perspective, retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' is crucial for preserving the depth and biblical context of the term. The teacher's reference answer highlights the significance of explaining the spiritual and eschatological implications of the term rather than altering it. The student's response, although thoughtful, falls short in aligning with this key Christian worldview perspective."
