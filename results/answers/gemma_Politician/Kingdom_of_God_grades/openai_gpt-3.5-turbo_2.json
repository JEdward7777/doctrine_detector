It offers well-reasoned options for rephrasing while highlighting the importance of balancing sensitivity with clarity. The conclusion also effectively summarizes the key points. However, the response could further strengthen its argument by addressing how to maintain the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term while rephrasing it, thereby enhancing the overall depth and persuasiveness of the response from a Christian worldview."
