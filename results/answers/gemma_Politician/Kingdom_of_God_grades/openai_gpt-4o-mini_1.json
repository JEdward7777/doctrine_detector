  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the concern about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' when rephrasing, it emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and respect for cultural differences. The suggestions for alternative translations are well thought out and considerate of various cultural perspectives. However, the grade is lower as the response does not sufficiently address how to retain the essential biblical meaning and context while still being sensitive to cultural differences. Integrating more strategies for maintaining the depth of the term while accommodating different cultural frameworks would strengthen the response."
