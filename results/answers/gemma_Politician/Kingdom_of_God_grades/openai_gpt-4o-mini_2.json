However, it lacks a strong emphasis on the biblical context and depth of the term, which holds significant importance in a Christian worldview. While inclusivity and respect are important, preserving the original spiritual and eschatological significance of the term should be a top priority. Further discussion on how to balance sensitivity with maintaining the biblical context would enhance the response."
