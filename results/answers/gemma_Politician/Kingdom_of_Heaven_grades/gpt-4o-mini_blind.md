Why is it important to retain the term 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' in the book of Matthew?

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student failed to address the question and instead deferred to religious authorities without engaging with the context or significance of the term 'heaven'. A more appropriate response would have involved discussing the theological implications and reasons for using 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' in the book of Matthew.
