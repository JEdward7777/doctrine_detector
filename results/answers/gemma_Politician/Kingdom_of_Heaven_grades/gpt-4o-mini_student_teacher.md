Comment: The student correctly acknowledges the importance of consulting religious authorities for matters of faith and terminology, which is commendable. However, the response lacks engagement with the specific concern provided, which was to analyze the unique terminology in the gospel of Matthew. The response does not directly address why retaining 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' is important in understanding the theological implications conveyed in Matthew's gospel. More effort should have been made to integrate the provided reference answer and concern into the response.
