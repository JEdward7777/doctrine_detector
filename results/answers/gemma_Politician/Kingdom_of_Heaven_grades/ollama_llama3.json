  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern about understanding unique terminology used in the gospels, specifically mentioning the significance of retaining \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven.\" However, it could be improved by providing more specific examples or analysis of how the unique terminology contributes to the intended message of Matthew's gospel. The response also does not explicitly connect the concern about understanding unique terminology to the biblical author's intended message.\n\nThe grade is higher than 0 because the response acknowledges the significance of retaining \"heaven\" in the phrase and provides some context, but it could be more developed and connected to the concern."
