Grade: 95

Comment: The response acknowledges the significance of retaining 'heaven' in the term 'kingdom of heaven' within Matthew's gospel and recognizes how understanding unique terminology aids in grasping the intended messages of the biblical authors. It shows a thoughtful consideration of the theological implications and aligns well with a Christian worldview perspective. The only slight deduction is due to not explicitly connecting this understanding to broader theological or doctrinal implications.
