  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 75.\n\nThe response accurately states that \"the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew\", which aligns with the given answer. However, it could have gone further to emphasize the significance of this knowledge for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context, as specified in the concern.\n\nA higher score would require a more explicit connection between the knowledge of the languages spoken in ancient times and its relevance to understanding the biblical text. Nevertheless, the response does acknowledge the importance of considering linguistic influences on the Old Testament's content, which shows some awareness of the issue.\n\nComment: The grade is 75 because the response provides some relevant information but could have been more explicit about the significance of this knowledge for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context."
