Comment: The response provided accurate information regarding the language in which the Old Testament was primarily written (Hebrew), which aligns with the Christian perspective on the origin of the Scriptures. However, it did not fully address the concern that understanding the original context of the Scriptures is crucial for studying them effectively. The acknowledgment of potential influences from other ancient Near Eastern languages would have further enhanced the response in light of the importance of contextual understanding in biblical interpretation from a Christian worldview.
