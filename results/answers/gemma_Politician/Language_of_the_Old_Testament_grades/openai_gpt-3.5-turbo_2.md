Comment: The response provides accurate information about the Old Testament being written in Hebrew, which is foundational for studying the Scriptures. However, it lacks nuance in acknowledging the possibility of influences from other languages in the ancient Near East, which could provide a richer understanding of the context in which the Old Testament was written. A more comprehensive answer that considers potential influences from other languages would enhance the response further.
