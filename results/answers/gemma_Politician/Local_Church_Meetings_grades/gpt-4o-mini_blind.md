Comment: While the student showed sensitivity towards avoiding perpetuating stereotypes, the response missed the mark in addressing the question from a Christian worldview. In this context, it would have been more appropriate to acknowledge how believers typically met in the early Christian church, such as gathering in homes or public spaces for worship and fellowship. Encouraging the student to understand and respectfully discuss religious practices within a historical context is crucial in academic settings.
