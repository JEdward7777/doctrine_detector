  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 50/100.\n\nComment: The student's response is focused on not providing information related to specific beliefs, which is a valid concern in certain contexts. However, in this case, the question specifically asked about believers meeting in a particular city according to church content. The student missed addressing the question entirely, which resulted in a low grade. It's important to prioritize relevance to the question being asked even when addressing concerns about perpetuating stereotypes."
