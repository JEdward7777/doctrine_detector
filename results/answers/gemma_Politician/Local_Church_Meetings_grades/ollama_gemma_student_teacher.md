## Grade by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the historical practices of early believers. However, it lacks specific examples or elaboration on the nature of local fellowship. The response could benefit from additional contextualization and elaboration on the significance of home-based gatherings in early Christian communities.
