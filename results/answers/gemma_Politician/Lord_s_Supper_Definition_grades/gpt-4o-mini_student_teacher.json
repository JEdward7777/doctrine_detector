However, they missed the crucial detail that the Lord's Supper primarily commemorates the Passover meal where Jesus symbolized his body and blood as a sacrifice for sin, which is a key aspect of the Christian faith. The answer would benefit from a clearer emphasis on the sacrificial aspect of the Lord's Supper."
