  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies the significance of the Lord's Supper as symbolizing Jesus' sacrifice for sin during the Passover meal. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding the meaning and significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith. However, there could have been a deeper elaboration on the theological implications of this act, which would have earned a higher grade."
