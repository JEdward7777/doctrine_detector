  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has offered a comprehensive and thoughtful response on the significance of the 'bond of marriage' from a Christian perspective. They have referenced relevant biblical passages and highlighted key aspects of a couple's commitment in marriage. However, the student could have emphasized more on the sanctity of marriage as a divine institution ordained by God and the need to prioritize God's design over cultural influences. Additionally, while the student addressed considerations for political correctness well, they could have further emphasized the importance of upholding Christian principles in promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages."
