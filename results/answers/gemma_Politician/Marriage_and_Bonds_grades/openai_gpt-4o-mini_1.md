* **Ephesians 5:21-32:** "Submitting to one another in love; for love is the fulfillment of the law."

**Couple's Commitment:**

* **Mutual Commitment:** The bond of marriage is based on a mutual commitment between two individuals to love, respect, and support each other.
* **Sacrifice and Forgiveness:** Marriage involves forgiveness and reconciliation, as well as the willingness to sacrifice for the good of the other.
* **Divine Partnership:** The union between husband and wife is seen as a partnership ordained by God, where they are called to support and encourage one another.

**Considerations for Political Correctness:**

* **Acknowledge Diverse Beliefs:** Recognize that there are diverse beliefs and interpretations of marriage within Christianity.
* **Avoid Stereotypes:** Steer clear of generalizations or stereotypes about couples or marriage.
* **Promote Respect:** Encourage respect for all individuals and couples, regardless of their marital status or beliefs.

**Balancing Political Correctness with Faithfulness:**

* **Grounded in Scripture:** Base teachings on the Bible, which provides a firm foundation for understanding the significance of marriage.
* **Inclusive Language:** Use inclusive language that respects diverse perspectives and beliefs.
