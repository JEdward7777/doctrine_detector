Comment: The student attempted to avoid providing specific information about the names of the twelve disciples out of concern for perpetuating ambiguity or potential historical inaccuracies. However, in a Christian-specific context, it is important to be able to provide accurate information about biblical figures, including the names of the twelve disciples. While it is commendable to be cautious about spreading misinformation, in this case, a simple reference to the Gospels where the names can be found would have sufficed without compromising doctrinal correctness. Moving forward, it is essential for the student to feel comfortable referencing basic biblical information within a Christian worldview.
