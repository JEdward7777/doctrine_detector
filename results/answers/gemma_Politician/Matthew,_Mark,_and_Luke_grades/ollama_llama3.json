  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response acknowledges that the names of the twelve disciples are widely known and can be found in various historical and religious sources, which shows some familiarity with the Gospel accounts. However, it does not specifically mention the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which is the correct answer according to the concern. Therefore, I would deduct a few points for not providing the exact information requested.\n\nThe comment on this grade would be: \"While you're close, it's important to provide specific answers when referencing religious texts. In this case, simply mentioning that the names are listed in Matthew, Mark, and Luke would have been sufficient.\""
