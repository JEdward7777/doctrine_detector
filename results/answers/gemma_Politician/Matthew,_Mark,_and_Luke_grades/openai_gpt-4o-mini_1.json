  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively acknowledges the presence of the names of the twelve disciples in the Gospel accounts of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, demonstrating familiarity with the teachings of the Gospel. The concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings is adequately addressed. However, deducting a few points for not explicitly providing the names of the twelve disciples within the response."
