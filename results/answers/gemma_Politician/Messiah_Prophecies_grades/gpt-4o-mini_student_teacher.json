The explanations were clear and supported by relevant biblical references. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing on a deeper analysis of each prophecy and its significance in strengthening faith in Jesus as the Messiah. Overall, a strong demonstration of connecting prophecies to Jesus' fulfillment."
