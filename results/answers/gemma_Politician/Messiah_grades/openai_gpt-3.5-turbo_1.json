However, it lacks addressing the concern provided fully. While the response accurately presents Jesus' role, it could benefit from incorporating elements such as acknowledging diverse religious expectations and being cautious of language implying exclusivity or superiority to differentiate Jesus' role from other religious savior figures while staying true to scripture in a more nuanced and holistic manner."
