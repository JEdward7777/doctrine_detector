However, they missed the opportunity to provide an alternative perspective from a Christian worldview regarding the significance of the title 'King of the Jews' in relation to Jesus' identity as the Messiah. In a Christian context, understanding Jesus' messianic role is indeed central to the faith, and it would have been beneficial for the student to address this aspect more directly."
