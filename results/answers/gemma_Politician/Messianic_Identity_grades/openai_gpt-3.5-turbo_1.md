Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately connects the title "King of the Jews" to Jesus' role as the promised Messiah and his lineage from King David, reflecting a strong understanding of Jesus' messianic role in Christianity. However, the response could be strengthened by providing additional Biblical references or theological insights to support this assertion.
