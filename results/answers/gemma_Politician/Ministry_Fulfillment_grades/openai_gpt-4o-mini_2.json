  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of fulfilling ministry as a Christian through serving others. It emphasizes core Christian principles such as empathy, humility, service, and seeking spiritual guidance. The suggestions provided align well with the Christian worldview of loving others and embodying Christ's teachings in daily life. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of discerning and executing one's specific God-given purpose in serving others, as this can deepen the impact and effectiveness of ministry."
