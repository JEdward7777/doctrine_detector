Grade: 50

Comment: While the student correctly acknowledges the limitations of their ability to discuss religious or spiritual concepts, they missed an opportunity to offer a brief explanation from a neutral perspective on how miracles could be perceived as signs leading to belief in God. In this context, a neutral and objective exploration of the concept could have been provided without endorsing or promoting any specific religious belief.
