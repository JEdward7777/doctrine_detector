Comment: The student's response acknowledges their limitations in discussing religious or spiritual concepts, which is understandable given their stance on providing factual and neutral information. However, in the context of this specific question and concern, an attempt to engage with the topic from a Christian worldview would have been beneficial. To improve, the student could have briefly highlighted the Christian perspective on miracles as signs of God's power and their role in leading others to faith.
