## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the role of miracles in leading others to faith. However, it lacks specific examples or elaboration on how miracles can validate the ministry of prophets and apostles. The response could benefit from further elaboration on the theological significance of miracles and their role in strengthening faith.
