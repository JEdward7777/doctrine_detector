  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response does not directly engage with the provided answer or concern, it does provide a clear statement of its limitations and boundaries. The mention of \"subjective\" religious concepts and the acknowledgment that miracles fall outside its knowledge domain is a crucial aspect of responsible AI communication. However, the lack of engagement with the original answer and concern means that the response does not contribute meaningfully to understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith.\n\nTo increase the grade, the response could have engaged more directly with the provided answer and concern, perhaps offering insights on how its limitations might be addressed or suggesting ways for humans to explore these topics further. As it stands, the response primarily serves as a disclaimer rather than a meaningful contribution to the discussion."
