Grade: 85

Comment: While the response does acknowledge the importance of miracles in demonstrating God's power and validating the ministry of spiritual leaders, it could have further emphasized the transformative impact of miracles in strengthening personal faith and evangelism efforts within a Christian worldview. Overall, the response aligns well with the concern presented, but a more explicit connection to evangelism and personal faith would have strengthened the argument.
