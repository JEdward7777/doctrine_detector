Comment: While it is understandable that the student may not have extensive knowledge in religious or theological interpretations, a basic understanding of the significance of myrrh as a gift given to Jesus at his birth could have been provided. It is important to be able to at least offer a general explanation or refer to the historical context in which myrrh was traditionally associated with burial and foreshadowing Jesus' eventual sacrifice. Striving to provide some level of context or understanding, even if brief, would have been beneficial.
