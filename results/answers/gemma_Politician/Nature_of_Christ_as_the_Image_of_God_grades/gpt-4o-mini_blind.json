  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a well-structured response explaining the concept of Jesus as the image of God in Christian belief. They accurately highlight the significance of this concept, touching on points such as divine perfection, human redemption, modeling Christian life, and assurance of God's acceptance. However, the inclusion of \"Political Considerations\" seems out of place in this theological discussion and detracts from the overall focus on Christian beliefs. Additionally, the student could deepen their analysis by incorporating more biblical references and exploring the theological implications further. Overall, a solid response with room for some improvement."
