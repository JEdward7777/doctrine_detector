  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the significance of Jesus as the image of God in Christian belief, outlining various key points and referencing relevant biblical passages. However, there is a slight deviation from the specific Christian worldview in their explanation. The reference answer emphasizes that Jesus is God himself, sharing the same essence with God the Father, while the student's response does not explicitly state Jesus' divinity and essence with God. This omission impacts the overall alignment with the Christian doctrine on this topic."
