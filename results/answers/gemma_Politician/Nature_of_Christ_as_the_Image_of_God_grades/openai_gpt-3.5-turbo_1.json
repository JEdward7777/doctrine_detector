It effectively addresses the concern regarding the theological understanding of Christ's nature in relation to God. The inclusion of biblical references and the significance of the Imago Dei adds depth to the response. The response could be further enhanced by directly referencing key doctrinal statements or creeds of Christianity that affirm Jesus' divinity and his role in salvation."
