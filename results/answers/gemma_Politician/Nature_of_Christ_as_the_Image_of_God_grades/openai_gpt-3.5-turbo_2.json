It effectively highlights the significance of the Imago Dei, provides relevant biblical references, and addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' divinity and role in salvation. The only minor improvement could be further connecting the concept of Imago Dei to the broader understanding of Christ's nature and role in the overall Christian worldview."
