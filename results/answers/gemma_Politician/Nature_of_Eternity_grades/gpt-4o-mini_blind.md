## [Answer](../Nature_of_Eternity.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
In Christian beliefs, eternity is the endless duration of time that encompasses both heaven and hell. It is a concept that emphasizes the everlasting nature of both punishment and reward.

Within these beliefs, eternity is often defined as:

* **Infinite duration:** Never-ending, without beginning or end.
* **Eternal punishment:** The state of suffering endured by those who reject God's love and obey his laws.
* **Eternal life:** The state of bliss and happiness enjoyed by those who accept God's grace and love.

It's important to note that there is diversity within Christian denominations regarding the precise theological interpretation of eternity.
