Comments: The student's response provides a good foundation on how Christians should approach exhortation, emphasizing sensitivity, respect, and groundedness in Scripture. However, there are a few areas of improvement. The focus on cultural sensitivity is commendable, but caution should be taken not to compromise biblical truths in the name of inclusivity. Additionally, the response could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of repentance and accountability in exhortation, as well as the need to point others towards obedience to God's Word rather than merely seeking common ground. Furthermore, while maintaining a loving and compassionate tone is crucial, the aspect of truth should not be neglected in exhortation.
