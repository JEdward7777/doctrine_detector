  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough and well-thought-out response to the question of how Christians should approach exhortation, there is a concern that their answer may overly prioritize sensitivity to diverse perspectives and cultural backgrounds over the foundational principle of exhorting in love. It is important for Christians to exhort each other in a loving and supportive manner, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's response includes valuable insights on scriptural grounding, tone, cultural sensitivity, personal accountability, seeking common ground, and modeling Christ's love, but the central focus on sensitivity should be balanced with the primary emphasis on exhortation in love according to the teachings of the New Testament."
