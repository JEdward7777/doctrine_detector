  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to addressing the concern of delivering encouragement in a loving and supportive manner. It is grounded in biblical principles and emphasizes sensitivity, respect, and love in exhortation. The guidelines outlined align well with the Christian worldview, focusing on Scripture, tone and language, cultural sensitivity, personal accountability, seeking common ground, and modeling Christ's love. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include specific examples or scenarios to further illustrate how these principles can be applied in real-life situations. Overall, a strong and well-rounded response."
