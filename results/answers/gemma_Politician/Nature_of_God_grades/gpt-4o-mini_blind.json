  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-articulated response that grasps the core concept of God being spirit and its implications on worship. They have outlined relevant interpretations and implications, highlighting the shift in focus from outward practices to spiritual connection. The response also acknowledges potential challenges and considerations that arise from this understanding. However, the student could strengthen the answer by incorporating more specific scriptural references to support their points and deepen the theological foundation of their argument. Additionally, further emphasis on the unique role of Jesus Christ as the bridge between God's spiritual nature and humanity could enhance the doctrinal clarity of the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in scriptural integration and doctrinal depth."
