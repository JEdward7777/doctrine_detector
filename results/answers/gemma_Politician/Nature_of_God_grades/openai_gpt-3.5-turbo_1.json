  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response gives a comprehensive understanding of Jesus' statement that God is a spirit, emphasizing the need for spiritual engagement in worship. The explanation demonstrates a good grasp of the essence of God and how to appropriately approach Him in worship from a Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by providing relevant interpretations, implications for worship, and considerations. The only area for improvement could be to include more specific biblical references to support the explanation further."
