It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the transcendence of God and the need for spiritual engagement in worship. The concluding remarks tie back to the initial concern. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific references to Christian teachings or scripture to strengthen the argument from a Christian worldview."
