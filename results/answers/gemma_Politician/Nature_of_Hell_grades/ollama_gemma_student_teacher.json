  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates an understanding of the general concept of hell as a place of punishment for rebellion against God. However, it lacks specific textual references or elaboration on the severity and purpose of hell, which is consistent with the specified concern. The response could benefit from a more nuanced and comprehensive exploration of the biblical passages related to hell."
