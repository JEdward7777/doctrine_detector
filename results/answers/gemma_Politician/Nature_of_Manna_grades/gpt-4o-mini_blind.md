Comment: While it's commendable to strive for objectivity, in this case, the response falls short as it fails to address the question within the context of Christian beliefs. A more suitable approach would have been to acknowledge that the Bible describes manna as appearing like coriander seed, white, and tasting like wafers made with honey (Exodus 16:31). It's important to provide accurate information within the specific parameters of the question.
