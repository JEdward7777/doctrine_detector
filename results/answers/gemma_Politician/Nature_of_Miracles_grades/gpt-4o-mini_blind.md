Comment: The response lacks doctrinal correctness by avoiding to engage with the question from a Christian perspective. In a Christian worldview, discussing the miracles of Jesus reveals important aspects of His identity as the Son of God, the Messiah, and the Savior. It's important to be able to articulate and discuss these beliefs in a knowledgeable and meaningful way.
