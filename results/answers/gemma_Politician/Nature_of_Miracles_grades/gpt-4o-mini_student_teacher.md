20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 20. 

While the student correctly acknowledges their limitations in providing interpretations or opinions on religious or spiritual matters, they missed the opportunity to provide a factual answer in alignment with a Christian worldview. In a context where the question specifically asks about the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature, it was essential for the student to engage with the provided reference answer to reflect the significance of Jesus's miracles in revealing His identity as the Son of God and the Messiah. The student's response lacked depth and relevance to the question, thus warranting a low grade.
