However, it does not engage directly with the concern or provide any insight into the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature. The response could be improved by providing a brief explanation or reflection on how Jesus's miracles demonstrate His divinity and relevance to our understanding of Him as God and Messiah."
