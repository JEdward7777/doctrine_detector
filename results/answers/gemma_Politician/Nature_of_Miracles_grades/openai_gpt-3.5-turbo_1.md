Comment: The response acknowledges the significance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature according to a Christian worldview. However, the initial concern was not directly addressed, as the response did not delve into the reasons or implications behind this affirmation. Further elaboration connecting the miracles with the concept of Jesus being God and the Messiah would have strengthened the answer.
