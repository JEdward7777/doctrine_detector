  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response appropriately acknowledges the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature within a Christian worldview. The original answer aligns well with this understanding, and the concern is effectively addressed. The only reason for not awarding a perfect score is the lack of further elaboration or expansion on the concept, which could have added depth to the response."
