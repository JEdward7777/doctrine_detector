  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response fails to engage with the question and concern provided. In a Christian worldview, it is important to consider the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word, which the student did not address. Encouraging discussions with religious scholars or spiritual leaders is valid, but in this context, a basic understanding and explanation of the relationship between scripture and the word of God was expected."
