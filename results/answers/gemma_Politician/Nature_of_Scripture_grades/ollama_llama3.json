However, it falls short in fully exploring the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word. While it mentions that the \"word of God\" can refer to both scripture and other messages from God, including those delivered by Jesus, it does not delve deeper into how these two forms of revelation intersect or complement each other.\n\nThe response is factual and neutral, which aligns with its original intention, but it could have provided more theological insight and analysis to fully address the concern. Overall, while the response takes some steps in the right direction, it requires further development to fully clarify the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word."
