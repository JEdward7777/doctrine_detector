Comment: The response does a good job in explaining the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word, mentioning that scripture encompasses God's written messages as well as messages delivered by Jesus. It aligns well with a Christian worldview by acknowledging the divine nature of scriptural texts and the messages they convey. However, deducting a few points for not delving deeper into how Christians believe these written scriptures are inspired by God and considered authoritative for their faith.
