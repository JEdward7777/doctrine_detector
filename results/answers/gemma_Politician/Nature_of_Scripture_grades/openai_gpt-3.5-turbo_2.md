## Stated Concern
Clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word.

Grade: 60

Comment: While the response provides a basic understanding of the term 'scripture' and the concept of the 'word of God,' it does not fully address the concern of clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word from a Christian perspective. The response lacks depth and fails to integrate a Christian worldview perspective to provide a more comprehensive explanation.
