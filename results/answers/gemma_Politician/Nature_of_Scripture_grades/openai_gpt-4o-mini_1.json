  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the term 'scripture' and the concept of the 'word of God' in relation to written and spoken messages. It effectively addresses the concern by distinguishing between the two forms of communication from God. The explanation is concise and well-structured, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The slight deduction in points is due to the lack of direct integration of Christian theological perspectives or references to Scripture in the response."
