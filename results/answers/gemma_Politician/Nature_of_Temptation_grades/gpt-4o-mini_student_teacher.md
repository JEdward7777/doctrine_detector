Comment: The student correctly acknowledges the limitation of the provided text in addressing the roles of sinful nature and external influences in temptation. However, the response lacks an attempt to integrate the general Christian teaching regarding temptation and the influence of our sinful nature and external factors. Encouragement for further exploration and application of Christian worldview in addressing such questions would be beneficial.
