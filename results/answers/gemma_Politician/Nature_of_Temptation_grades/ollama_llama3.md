## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
The provided text does not contain any information regarding the roles of sinful nature or external influences in temptation, so I am unable to answer this question from the given context.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The response accurately acknowledges that it cannot answer the question based on the provided text, which shows some understanding of the limitations of the context. However, the response does not demonstrate an attempt to provide insight into the sources and reasons for temptation from a Christian teaching perspective, as reflected in the concern. A higher grade would require the student to draw upon their knowledge of biblical teachings and Christian doctrine to provide a more comprehensive answer.
