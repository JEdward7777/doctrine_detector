Grade: 85

Comment: The response correctly identifies and elaborates on the Christian perspective regarding the sources and reasons for temptation, citing both our sinful nature and external influences like other people and Satan. The only area for improvement would be to provide more specific references to biblical teachings or theological concepts to further enrich the explanation within a Christian worldview.
