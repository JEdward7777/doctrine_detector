  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies the sources of temptation according to Christian teaching, acknowledging the role of sinful nature and external influences like other people and Satan. However, the response does not directly address the question posed from the given context, as there is no explicit mention of sinful nature or external influences in the provided text. Nonetheless, the understanding of Christian teaching on temptation is accurately reflected in the response, hence the strong grade."
