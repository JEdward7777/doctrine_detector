Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a clear explanation of the sources and reasons for temptation according to Christian teaching. The deduction in points is due to the initial response not directly engaging with the question from a Christian worldview perspective, although the reasoning for this is understandable given the lack of necessary context in the provided text.
