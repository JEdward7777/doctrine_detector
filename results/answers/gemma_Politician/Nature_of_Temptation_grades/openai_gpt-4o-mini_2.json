  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies the Christian perspective on the sources of temptation, mentioning both our sinful nature and external influences like other people and Satan. The only critique is that the initial response could have elaborated on how these sources of temptation relate to the situation provided in the question."
