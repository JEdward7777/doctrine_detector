Comment: While it is understandable that the student may not feel equipped to delve deeply into religious interpretations, a higher grade could have been achieved by acknowledging the existence of the concept of wickedness within Christianity and providing a general statement about it, even if not a detailed analysis. It's important for students to show some engagement with the topic even if they choose not to elaborate.
