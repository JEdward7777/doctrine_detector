  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response accurately acknowledges the biblical perspective on wickedness as disobedience to God and immoral actions. It also briefly explains the resulting state of separation from righteousness and God's favor. However, the response lacks additional elaboration and depth in exploring the concept of wickedness from a biblical perspective."
