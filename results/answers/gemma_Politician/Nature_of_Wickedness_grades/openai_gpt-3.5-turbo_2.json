It effectively addresses the concern by connecting biblical perspectives on wickedness to moral behavior and spiritual growth from a Christian worldview. The deduction in points is due to the initial disclaimer about discussing religious texts, which, although understandable, slightly detracts from the overall completeness of the response."
