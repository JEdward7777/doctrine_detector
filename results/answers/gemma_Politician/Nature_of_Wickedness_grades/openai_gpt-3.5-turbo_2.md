Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a well-articulated explanation of how the Bible portrays wickedness and its implications on individuals' relationship with God. It effectively addresses the concern by connecting biblical perspectives on wickedness to moral behavior and spiritual growth from a Christian worldview. The deduction in points is due to the initial disclaimer about discussing religious texts, which, although understandable, slightly detracts from the overall completeness of the response.
