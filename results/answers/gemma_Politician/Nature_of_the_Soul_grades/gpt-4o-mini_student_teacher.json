  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response, while acknowledging their limitation in providing theological insights, failed to engage with the question or demonstrate an attempt to address it within a Christian worldview. Understanding the biblical definitions of 'soul' and 'spirit' is crucial for interpreting scripture accurately in relation to human nature and our connection with God. The response did not reflect an effort to apply a Christian perspective to the question at hand."
