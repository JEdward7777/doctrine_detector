  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response acknowledges that it cannot provide interpretations or theological insights, which shows a healthy humility in recognizing its limitations. However, the statement does not directly address the concern about understanding biblical definitions to ensure accurate interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God.\n\nThe concern is specifically focused on ensuring accurate interpretation of scripture, but the response only mentions not providing interpretations or theological insights. It does not explicitly connect the dots between understanding biblical definitions and accurate interpretation.\n\nWhile the response shows a willingness to acknowledge limitations, it could be improved by directly addressing the concern and making a more explicit connection between understanding biblical definitions and accurate scriptural interpretation."
