  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 40/100.\n\nComment: While the student's response acknowledges the sensitivity of religious interpretations, it falls short in addressing the specific concern about the restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. The answer provided by the student lacks the necessary content related to the key restrictions of the Nazirite vow, which include abstaining from certain activities as outlined in the reference answer. It's important for students to engage with the specific content of the question while being mindful of religious sensitivities."
