70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** While the student correctly avoids potentially controversial or offensive interpretations, the response lacks depth and does not elaborate on the purpose or significance of the Nazirite vow beyond stating its restrictions. The response could benefit from additional contextualization and analysis of the vow's significance within biblical narrative and theology.
