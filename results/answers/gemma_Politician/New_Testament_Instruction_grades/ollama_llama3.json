  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges that religious guidance should come from authorities or scholars, which shows an understanding of the limitations of a LLM's ability to provide theological guidance. However, it does not directly address the concern of identifying how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship. The original answer about singing psalms in the New Testament is relevant to this concern, but the response does not explicitly connect the two. Therefore, while the response shows some awareness of limitations and relevance, it falls short of fully addressing the concern."
