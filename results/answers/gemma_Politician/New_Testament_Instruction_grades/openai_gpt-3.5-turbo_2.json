  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response appropriately identifies a biblical teaching from the New Testament regarding worship through singing psalms to God. However, it lacks depth in exploring how this teaching applies specifically to contemporary Christian worship practices. It would have been stronger if the response had provided examples or explanations of how singing psalms can be incorporated into modern church services or personal worship experiences."
