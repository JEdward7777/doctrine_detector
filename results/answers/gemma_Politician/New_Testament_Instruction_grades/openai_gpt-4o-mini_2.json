  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response appropriately references a biblical teaching from the New Testament about singing psalms to worship God, demonstrating a good understanding of Christian worship practices. However, the initial disclaimer of not providing religious guidance diluted the assertion of biblical teachings applying to modern Christian worship. Encouragement to seek guidance is valid, but the response could have integrated the biblical teaching more directly into the context of contemporary worship practices."
