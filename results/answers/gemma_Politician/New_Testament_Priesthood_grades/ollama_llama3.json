  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does not directly address the concept of the priesthood of all believers, but instead provides a general statement about consultation with religious texts and authoritative sources. However, it does indirectly acknowledge the importance of understanding theological concepts and seeking accurate information from reliable sources. This shows some level of awareness and recognition of the concern.\n\nTo improve this response, the LLM could provide more direct engagement with the concept of the priesthood of all believers and offer a thoughtful interpretation or reflection on its significance for Christian faith and practice."
