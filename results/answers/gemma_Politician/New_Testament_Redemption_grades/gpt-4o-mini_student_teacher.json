It would have been beneficial for them to mention how the concept of purification evolved from the Old Testament practices of animal sacrifices to the New Testament understanding of ultimate purification through Jesus Christ's sacrifice. Encouraging them to engage more with the theological aspects would enhance their response from a Christian perspective."
