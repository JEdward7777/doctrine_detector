**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's response correctly acknowledges the shift from physical sacrifices in the Old Testament to spiritual purification through Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament. However, the response would benefit from further elaboration on the specific changes in the concept of purification between the two testaments.
