Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the concept of purification in the New Testament, specifically highlighting Jesus' sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin. While it does not explicitly address the concern of recognizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice, it is implicit throughout the response and aligns with the concern. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian theology and effectively communicates the biblical concept of purification.
