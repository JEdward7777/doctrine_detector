Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Christian concept of purification through repentance, trust in Jesus, and His sacrifice as the means of eternal cleansing from sin. It aligns well with the concern of recognizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice in Christian theology. The deduction in grade is due to the initial reluctance to engage in religious or theological discussions, but overall, the response effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview.
