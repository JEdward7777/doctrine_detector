## Question [New Testament References](../../../questions/New_Testament_References.md)
What evidence is there in the New Testament suggesting that John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite?

## Correct Answer
The angel's announcement to Zechariah that John would not drink strong drink suggests that John was under the Nazirite vow.

Connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to better understand biblical continuity.
