20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response does not engage with the question from a Christian worldview, which is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the topic. In this case, the purpose of Noah's Ark as described in the Bible is a fundamental aspect of the story and should have been addressed with references to the biblical text or Christian theology.
