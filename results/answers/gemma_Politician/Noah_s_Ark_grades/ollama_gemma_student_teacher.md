## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's response accurately states the primary purpose of Noah's Ark as described in the Bible, focusing on its role in protecting Noah, his family, and animals from the flood as God's judgment. However, the response lacks additional elaboration or analysis of the broader theological or philosophical implications of the event within a Christian worldview.
