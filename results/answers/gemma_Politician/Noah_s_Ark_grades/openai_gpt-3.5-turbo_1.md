Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the purpose of Noah's Ark within the context of God's judgment and preservation. It aligns well with a Christian worldview, acknowledging the significance of God's plan for salvation through Noah and the Ark. The only slight deduction is for not expanding further on how this narrative ties into broader themes of salvation and redemption in Christian theology.
