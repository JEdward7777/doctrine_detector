Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the purpose of Noah's Ark in line with a Christian worldview. It acknowledges and emphasizes God's judgment on humanity and the role of preservation in His plan for salvation. The only minor deduction is due to the initial disclaimer that limits the interpretation of religious texts from a political perspective, which may not fully embrace the holistic worldview needed to understand God's plan in this narrative.
