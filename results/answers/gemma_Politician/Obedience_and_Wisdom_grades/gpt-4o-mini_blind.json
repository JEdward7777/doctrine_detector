It correctly emphasizes the importance of God's Word in expanding perspective, providing moral guidance, promoting humility and empathy, connecting to a source of wisdom beyond human knowledge, inspiring reflection and growth, and fostering a spirit of inquiry. The response could be enhanced by including specific biblical references to support these points and strengthen the doctrinal foundation even further."
