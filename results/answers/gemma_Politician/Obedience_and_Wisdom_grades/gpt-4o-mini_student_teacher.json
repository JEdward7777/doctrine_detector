  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of how listening to God can contribute to becoming wise from various angles. The points made about expanding perspective, providing moral guidance, promoting humility and empathy, connecting to a source of wisdom beyond human knowledge, inspiring reflection and growth, and fostering a spirit of inquiry are all relevant and insightful. However, the concern specified emphasizes the importance of obedience to God in the journey towards wisdom, which the student's answer does not explicitly address. While the student's response offers valuable perspectives on how listening to God connects to wisdom, a stronger emphasis on the aspect of obedience to God's will could enhance the alignment with the Christian worldview."
