  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response does an excellent job of highlighting the importance of listening to God in becoming wise. The various points listed, such as expanding perspective, providing moral guidance, promoting humility and empathy, connecting to a source of wisdom beyond human knowledge, inspiring reflection and growth, and fostering a spirit of inquiry, all contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how listening to God can lead to wisdom.\n\nThe response also acknowledges the link between obedience to God and wisdom, which is in line with the concern specified. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved.\n\nFor instance, while it mentions that listening to God can promote humility and empathy, it does not explicitly state how this contributes to becoming wise. Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific examples or biblical references to further support its claims.\n\nOverall, I would give this response an 85, as it provides a solid foundation for understanding the relationship between listening to God and wisdom. With some additional development and specificity, it could be even more effective in conveying this message."
