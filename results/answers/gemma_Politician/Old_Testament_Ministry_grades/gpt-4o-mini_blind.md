## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While it's commendable that the student acknowledges their limitations in providing interpretations or historical analyses of religious or theological concepts, the response lacks an attempt to engage with the question. It would have been more appropriate to mention the biblical sources or acknowledge the importance of the priests' ministry in the Old Testament within the Christian worldview.
