70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** While the student's response acknowledges their limitations in interpreting religious concepts, it fails to engage with the specific question or address the concern related to sacrificial service. The response provides a general disclaimer rather than a substantive explanation of the priests' ministry in the temple.
