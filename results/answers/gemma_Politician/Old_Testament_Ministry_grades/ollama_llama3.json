  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response accurately states its limitations, which is commendable. However, it does not demonstrate any understanding or connection to the concern about recognizing Old Testament practices informing current ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service. The answer provided does not even hint at how the priests' roles might be relevant to modern-day ministry or sacrifice. While the response acknowledges its limitations, it does not take a step forward to explore the potential connections between ancient priesthood duties and contemporary Christian practice.\n\nA higher grade would require the response to demonstrate some understanding of how the practices described in the Old Testament can inform current ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service."
