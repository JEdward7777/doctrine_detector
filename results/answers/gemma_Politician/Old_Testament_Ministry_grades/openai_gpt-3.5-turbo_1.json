The concern regarding how these practices can inform current ministry approaches was acknowledged and addressed effectively by linking the historical practices to contemporary understanding of sacrificial service. The only deduction is due to the initial disclaimer, as Christians are encouraged to engage in discussions and interpretations of religious concepts from a biblical perspective. However, overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview."
