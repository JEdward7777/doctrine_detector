  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: This response provides a solid comparison of the Old Testament and New Testament understandings of atonement from a Christian worldview. The distinction between physical vs. spiritual aspects of atonement is well-articulated, and the theological implications are clearly presented. The closing conclusion effectively summarizes the key differences between the two perspectives. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
