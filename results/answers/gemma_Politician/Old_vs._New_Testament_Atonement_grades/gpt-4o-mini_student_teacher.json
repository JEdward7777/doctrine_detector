  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed comparison between the Old Testament and New Testament understandings of atonement, highlighting key differences in the nature of sacrifice, focus, and underlying belief. However, the student's answer lacked a direct mention of the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history, which was the specific concern mentioned. The reference answer succinctly addresses this transition, which the student did not explicitly address. More focus on the transition aspect would have strengthened the response."
