  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 70.\n\nThe response does address the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history, as it highlights the difference between the Old Testament's temporary blood sacrifices and the New Testament's emphasis on Christ's single, sufficient sacrifice. However, the response could be improved by further developing this point and providing more specific examples or scriptures to support its claims.\n\nThe response also provides a good overview of the two different understandings of atonement in the Old and New Testaments, but it could benefit from more depth and analysis. For example, the response could explore the implications of these differences for our understanding of salvation and reconciliation with God.\n\nOverall, while the response is clear and concise, it could be stronger if it delved deeper into the biblical material and explored the significance of the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in more detail."
