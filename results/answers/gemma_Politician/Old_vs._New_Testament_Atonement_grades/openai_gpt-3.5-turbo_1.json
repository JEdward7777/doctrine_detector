It clearly addresses the concern by emphasizing the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The comparison between physical rituals in the Old Testament and the spiritual solution through Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament is well-explained. The conclusion ties everything together nicely. Well done!"
