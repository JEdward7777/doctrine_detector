**Old Testament Understanding of Atonement:**

* Focuses on animal sacrifices and rituals as a means of atonement.
* Emphasis on restoring relationship with God through physical offerings.
* Underlying belief that sin separates people from God and requires physical intervention to bridge the gap.


**New Testament Understanding of Atonement:**

* Emphasis on Jesus Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and complete atonement for sin.
* Understanding of sin as a spiritual problem, requiring a spiritual solution.
* Reconciliation with God is through faith in Jesus Christ, who paid the penalty for sins on the cross.


**Key Differences:**

* **Nature of Sacrifice:** Old Testament sacrifices were physical rituals, while New Testament atonement rests solely on Christ's sacrifice, which was a spiritual and theological act.
* **Focus:** Old Testament atonement focused on restoring relationship with God through physical actions, while New Testament atonement focuses on reconciliation with God through faith in Jesus Christ.
* **Underlying Belief:** Old Testament atonement involved the belief that sin required physical intervention, while New Testament atonement emphasizes the need for spiritual transformation through faith.

**Conclusion:**

The concept of atonement in the Old Testament and New Testament differs significantly. The Old Testament emphasizes physical sacrifices and rituals, while the New Testament focuses on Jesus Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and complete atonement for sin through faith.
