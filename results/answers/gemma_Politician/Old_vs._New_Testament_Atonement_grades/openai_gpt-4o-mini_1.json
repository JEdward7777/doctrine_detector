The comparison between the Old Testament understanding of atonement through physical rituals and the New Testament emphasis on spiritual transformation through faith in Jesus Christ is well articulated. The answer addresses the concern excellently by providing a clear and concise explanation of the transition in the concept of atonement between the two testaments within a Christian worldview. Great job!"
