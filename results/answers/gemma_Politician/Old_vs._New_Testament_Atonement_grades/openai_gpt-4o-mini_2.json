The analysis is clear and well-supported, highlighting the significant theological differences between the two covenants in a concise and accurate manner. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a brief mention of the everlasting nature of Christ's atonement in the New Testament to further emphasize the transition from temporary to permanent atonement."
