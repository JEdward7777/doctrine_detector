  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: \nThe response effectively emphasizes biblical monotheism and the unique nature of God, which aligns with the concern of upholding the biblical truth of one God. However, to improve the grade, the response could benefit from incorporating more inclusive language, contextualizing cultural differences, and emphasizing the universal nature of the divine, as outlined in the criteria. By integrating these aspects, the response would more comprehensively address the concern while maintaining a Christian-specific worldview."
