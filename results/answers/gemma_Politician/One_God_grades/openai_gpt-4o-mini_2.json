However, there is room for improvement in incorporating inclusive language, contextualizing cultural differences, emphasizing the universal nature of the divine, and using inclusive metaphors to address the issue of cultural polytheism. Integrating these aspects more thoroughly would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
