As a Christian, it is important to recognize the significance of biblical festivals in the context of the fulfillment found in Jesus Christ. The response could have been strengthened by discussing how the Festival of Weeks foreshadows the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost and the birth of the Christian Church."
