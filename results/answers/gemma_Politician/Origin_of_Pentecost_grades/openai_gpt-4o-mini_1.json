However, it does not address the concern of connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ, which is a critical aspect from a Christian worldview. It is important to understand and discuss how Old Testament festivals like the Festival of Weeks foreshadow or are fulfilled in Christ according to Christian beliefs."
