  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies that Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in Antioch, displaying knowledge of the historical context and significance of the term. The only reason for deducting points is the initial disclaimer stating an inability to provide historical interpretations or opinions, which despite being referenced accurately in this case, seems unnecessary. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
