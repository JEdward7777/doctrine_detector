Grade: 30

Comment: While the student's response emphasizes the importance of consulting reliable sources and having respectful discussions on sensitive topics, they fail to address the actual question asked. In a theological context, it is essential to provide a clear and accurate response rooted in Biblical teachings. It is important to balance sensitivity with doctrinal correctness when addressing such inquiries.
