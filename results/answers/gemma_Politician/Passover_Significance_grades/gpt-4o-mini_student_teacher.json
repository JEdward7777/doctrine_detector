  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer shows a lack of understanding regarding the Christian perspective on the connection between the Old Testament Passover and Jesus. They missed the opportunity to explain how Passover foreshadowed Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice brings eternal salvation to humanity. The response also lacks depth in connecting the significance of Passover to Christian beliefs and practices. Further study and reflection on the theological significance of Passover for Christians is needed."
