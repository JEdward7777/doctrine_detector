  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nWhile the student acknowledges the connection between the Old Testament Passover and Jesus as the Passover Lamb, their response lacks depth and fails to elaborate on the significance of this connection for Christians. The answer could benefit from further elaboration on how the celebration of Passover is connected to Christian beliefs and practices, specifically referencing the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the ultimate Passover sacrifice."
