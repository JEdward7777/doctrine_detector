However, the response lacks depth in explaining the theological connection between the Old Testament Passover and the New Testament revelation of Jesus. It could have elaborated more on how Jesus fulfilled the symbolism of the Passover through His atoning sacrifice. Further integrating biblical references and theological insights would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
