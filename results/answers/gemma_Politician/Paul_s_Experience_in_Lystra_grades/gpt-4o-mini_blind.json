However, it misses the opportunity to provide a Christian-specific perspective on the lessons that can be learned from Paul's experience in Lystra. It is important to approach the question from a doctrinal standpoint rather than dismiss it outright. Consider discussing how Paul's faith and perseverance in the face of persecution align with biblical teachings on enduring hardships for the sake of Christ."
