Comment: While it is understandable to have concerns about glorifying violence, it is important to approach this from a Christian perspective where the lesson drawn from Paul's stoning in Lystra is not about normalizing harm but about emphasizing perseverance in faith and ministry even in the face of persecution. The student could have acknowledged the unjust nature of the event while still extracting the valuable lesson of perseverance in faith.
