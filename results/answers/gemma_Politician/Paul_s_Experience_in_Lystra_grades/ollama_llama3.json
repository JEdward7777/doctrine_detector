While it's true that Paul's stoning in Lystra was an unjust event, framing it as a model for perseverance in faith or ministry can be seen as condoning violence and intolerance. The response could have been stronger by acknowledging the complexity of the situation and emphasizing alternative examples of Christian perseverance that are more biblical and morally upright."
