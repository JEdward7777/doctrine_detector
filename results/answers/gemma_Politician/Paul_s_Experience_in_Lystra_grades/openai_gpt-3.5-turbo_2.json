However, it fails to address the concern of glorifying or normalizing harmful practices, such as stoning. A Christian worldview values the sanctity of life and condemns acts of violence, even in the context of adversity. The response could be improved by emphasizing alternative ways in which Christians can demonstrate perseverance and faith without condoning harmful actions."
