Comment: The response you provided contradicts a Christian worldview by portraying the stoning of Paul in Lystra as a positive example of perseverance in faith. As a Christian, it is important to recognize that violence and injustice should never be glorified or normalized, even in the context of difficult circumstances. It is essential to uphold Christian values of love, mercy, and forgiveness, rather than using violent acts to demonstrate faithfulness.
