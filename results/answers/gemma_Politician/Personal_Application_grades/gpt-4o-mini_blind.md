## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While the student correctly acknowledges their limitations in delving into religious or theological interpretations, they fall short by not attempting to provide any insight or information on the topic. A better response could have briefly explained the concept of purification from sin from a Christian perspective, even if it was at a more basic level.
