  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response lacks depth and understanding of the concept of purification from sin in a Christian context. They failed to address the personal implications of this experience in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living, which was a key concern in the question. The student should have at least attempted to provide a basic explanation from a Christian perspective."
