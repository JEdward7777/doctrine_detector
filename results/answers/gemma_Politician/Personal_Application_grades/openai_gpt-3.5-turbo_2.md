Comment: The response acknowledges the Christian perspective on purification from sin, emphasizing repentance, seeking forgiveness from God, and trusting in Jesus' sacrifice. It addresses the concern by highlighting the personal implications of being made pure in one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. However, it could be strengthened by further delving into how this purification affects one's daily walk with God and the practical outworking of holy living in behavior and attitude.
