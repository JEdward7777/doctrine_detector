Grade: 20

Comment: While the student acknowledged the complexity of the expression "woe is me," they missed an opportunity to provide a Christian perspective on the understanding of suffering and sin. In a Christian worldview, "woe is me" can reflect a recognition of personal sinfulness and a humble posture before God. Encouraging the student to consider how Christian beliefs could shape their interpretation would have strengthened their response.
