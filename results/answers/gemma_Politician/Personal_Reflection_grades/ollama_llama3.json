  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response does acknowledge that \"woe is me\" expresses sorrow and recognition of suffering or sin, which aligns with the concern about encouraging personal reflection on one's own spiritual state and awareness of sin. However, the response falls short in not fully exploring the biblical implications of this phrase. A higher grade would require a more explicit connection to the concept of sin and its consequences, as well as a clear call for personal reflection and repentance."
