  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response appropriately acknowledges the Christian perspective on the expression \"woe is me\" by linking it to deep sorrow, suffering, and consequences of sin. It aligns well with the concern of encouraging personal reflection on one's spiritual state and awareness of sin from a Christian worldview. The deducting points are due to not explicitly stating that \"woe is me\" carries these Christian implications."
