  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-structured and detailed response that covers the impact of the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses on their relationship with Jesus and early Christians. They have identified key areas of tension and the resulting impact on relationships effectively. The response also considers modern considerations for political correctness, demonstrating an awareness of cultural sensitivity. However, while the response is thorough, it could be strengthened by directly connecting the Pharisees' focus on legalism with the conflicts they had with Jesus and early Christians, as highlighted in the reference answer."
