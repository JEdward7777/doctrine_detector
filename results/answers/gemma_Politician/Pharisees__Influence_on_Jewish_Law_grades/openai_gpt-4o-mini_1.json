The discussion on interpretation of the Law, emphasis on purity, rejection of authority, and the resulting schism between the Pharisees and early Christians is insightful. The considerations for political correctness, such as avoiding offense and engaging in respectful dialogue, demonstrate a thoughtful approach. The integration of a Christian worldview perspective and the focus on the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry are well-highlighted. Great job overall in providing a comprehensive perspective on the dynamics between the Pharisees, Jesus, and early Christians."
