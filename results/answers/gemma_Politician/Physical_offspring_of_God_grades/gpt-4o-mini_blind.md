I would grade this response as 80.

Comment: The answer provides a solid framework for addressing the misconception regarding the term "Son of God" by emphasizing its symbolic and spiritual nature, utilizing inclusive language, referencing relevant scriptures, promoting dialogue, and offering inclusive summaries. However, there is room for improvement in delving deeper into the theological implications and unpacking the significance of the term within Christian doctrine. A stronger integration of doctrinal teachings could enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the response.
