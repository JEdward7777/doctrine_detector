  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response contains comprehensive strategies for clarifying the term \"Son of God\" and emphasizes the symbolic and spiritual nature of the concept. The inclusion of contextual clarification, inclusive language, scriptural interpretation, transparency, and dialogue is commendable. However, the reference answer from the teacher provides a more concise and direct approach to addressing the concern. The student's response could benefit from being more focused and directly addressing the doctrinal error regarding physical offspring. Overall, the student's effort is commendable, but there is room for improvement in clarity and conciseness."
