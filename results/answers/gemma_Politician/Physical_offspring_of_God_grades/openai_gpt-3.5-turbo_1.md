Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation that aligns with Christian beliefs by emphasizing Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God as the meaning of "Son of God." However, it lacks the depth and contextual clarification needed to address the concern about preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology. The response could be improved by integrating more scriptural references, historical context, and inclusive language to enhance understanding and prevent misinterpretation.
