Comment: The response provides a clear explanation that the term "Son of God" refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, which aligns with Christian teachings. However, the answer lacks depth in addressing the concern of retaining biblical terminology and preventing doctrinal errors. It would have been beneficial to incorporate more scriptural support and theological context to strengthen the explanation further.
