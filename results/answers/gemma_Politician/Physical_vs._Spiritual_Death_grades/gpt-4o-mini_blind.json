However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the spiritual meaning of \"perish\" is more than just a gradual loss of spiritual vitality or values. It signifies eternal separation from God and ultimate spiritual destruction without salvation through Christ. The answer could have been stronger by incorporating this doctrinal perspective and providing clearer distinctions based on Christian teachings."
