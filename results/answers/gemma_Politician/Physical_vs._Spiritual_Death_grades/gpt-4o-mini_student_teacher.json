  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful and sensitive overview of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual concept of \"perish.\" They emphasize the importance of using appropriate language and being mindful of different beliefs and perspectives. However, the answer falls short in directly addressing the specifically Christian worldview perspective that highlights the eternal consequences of not trusting in Jesus. This crucial aspect should have been explicitly mentioned and emphasized in light of the concern provided. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but lacks a clear alignment with the Christian perspective outlined in the reference answer."
