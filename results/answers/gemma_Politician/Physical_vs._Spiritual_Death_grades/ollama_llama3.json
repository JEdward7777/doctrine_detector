  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the original response attempts to clarify the distinction between physical and spiritual death, it falls short in several areas. Firstly, the concern about clarifying the distinction is only partially addressed. The original response provides some general information about the concepts, but it does not provide a clear explanation of how they relate to each other or how one should be understood in light of the other.\n\nFurthermore, the tone of the original response seems to be more concerned with avoiding offense and perpetuating harmful stereotypes than with providing a nuanced understanding of the distinction between physical and spiritual death. This is evident in the emphasis on \"sensitivity\" and the use of language that is intended to avoid causing distress or offense.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response would need to provide a clearer explanation of how physical and spiritual death relate to each other, and it would need to demonstrate a greater willingness to engage with the complex issues surrounding these concepts."
