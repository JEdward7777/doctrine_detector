The suggested approach emphasizes sensitivity, respect for diverse beliefs, and contextual understanding, which align well with a Christian worldview. However, it could have delved deeper into how the spiritual consequences of 'perishing' relate to the concept of eternal separation from God, which is a crucial aspect in Christian theology."
