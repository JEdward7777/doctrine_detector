**Early Christians expressed their fellowship in ways that were respectful of the cultural and social norms of their time.** They did not engage in behavior that would be considered offensive or blasphemous by their contemporaries. Some early Christian practices that reflected their commitment to inclusivity and cultural sensitivity include:

* **Inclusivity of Converts:** Early Christians welcomed people from diverse backgrounds and social classes, including slaves and women, into their fellowship.
* **Adaptation to Local Cultures:** Early Christian communities adapted their practices to the customs and traditions of the regions where they lived, such as celebrating festivals and upholding cultural norms.
* **Avoidance of Blasphemy:** Early Christians carefully avoided any actions or teachings that could be interpreted as blasphemous or offensive to their non-Christian neighbors.
* **Emphasis on Love and Compassion:** Early Christian teachings emphasized love, compassion, and forgiveness, which helped foster a sense of inclusivity and tolerance among followers.

**Early Christians understood the importance of respecting the cultural and social norms of their time while remaining faithful to their faith.** Their actions demonstrated that Christianity could coexist peacefully with other belief systems and cultures.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student's response provides a general overview of how early Christians expressed their fellowship in a culturally sensitive manner. The emphasis on inclusivity, adaptation to local cultures, avoidance of blasphemy, and the promotion of love and compassion are all valid points. However, the answer lacks specific examples from the early Christian period, such as the sharing of resources in Acts 2:44-47 or the agape feasts mentioned in Jude 1:12. Including more concrete examples would strengthen the argument and provide a deeper insight into how early Christians practiced fellowship.
