Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a well-structured and thoughtful response regarding how early Christians expressed their fellowship, highlighting important aspects such as inclusivity, adaptation to local cultures, and emphasis on love and compassion. However, the answer did not directly align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which focused more on specific practices such as listening to God's Word, praying together, sharing belongings, and eating meals together. While the student's insights were valuable, there was a lack of emphasis on these specific practices mentioned in the reference answer. The student could improve the grade by incorporating and elaborating on the practices mentioned in the teacher's answer.
