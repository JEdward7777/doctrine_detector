The concern about recognizing the practices of fellowship is also not directly addressed in this response. To improve, the response could provide more concrete illustrations of early Christian practices, such as sharing meals or visiting the sick, that can be applied today.\n\nThe response does mention some positive aspects, such as inclusivity and adaptation to local cultures, which are relevant to the concern about fostering deeper connections with each other. However, it falls short in providing a clear connection between these historical practices and how they can be applied in contemporary Christian fellowship."
