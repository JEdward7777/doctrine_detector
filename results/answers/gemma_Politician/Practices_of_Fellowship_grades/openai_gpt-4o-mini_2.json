  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85. \n\nThe response addresses the concern by emphasizing key practices of fellowship among early Christians, such as listening to God's Word, praying, sharing belongings, and eating meals together. However, the response does not directly engage with the provided answer, which discusses the cultural and social norms respected by early Christians in their expressions of fellowship. \n\nWhile the response provides valuable insight into early Christian practices of fellowship, it could have been improved by integrating the provided answer more effectively or by directly addressing the concern provided. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of early Christian fellowship practices and their relevance to contemporary Christian connection-building efforts."
