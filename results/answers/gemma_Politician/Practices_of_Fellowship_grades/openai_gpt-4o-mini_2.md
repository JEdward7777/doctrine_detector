## [Answer](../Practices_of_Fellowship.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
**Early Christians expressed their fellowship in ways that were respectful of the cultural and social norms of their time.** They did not engage in behavior that would be considered offensive or blasphemous by their contemporaries. Some early Christian practices that reflected their commitment to inclusivity and cultural sensitivity include:

* **Inclusivity of Converts:** Early Christians welcomed people from diverse backgrounds and social classes, including slaves and women, into their fellowship.
* **Adaptation to Local Cultures:** Early Christian communities adapted their practices to the customs and traditions of the regions where they lived, such as celebrating festivals and upholding cultural norms.
* **Avoidance of Blasphemy:** Early Christians carefully avoided any actions or teachings that could be interpreted as blasphemous or offensive to their non-Christian neighbors.
* **Emphasis on Love and Compassion:** Early Christian teachings emphasized love, compassion, and forgiveness, which helped foster a sense of inclusivity and tolerance among followers.

**Early Christians understood the importance of respecting the cultural and social norms of their time while remaining faithful to their faith.** Their actions demonstrated that Christianity could coexist peacefully with other belief systems and cultures.
