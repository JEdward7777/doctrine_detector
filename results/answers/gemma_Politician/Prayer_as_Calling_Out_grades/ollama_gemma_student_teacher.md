Given the sensitivity surrounding religious terminology and the importance of inclusivity, we can interpret the phrase "call out to the Lord" in our prayers as a metaphorical expression of expressing deep personal connection and gratitude to a higher power. It does not necessarily imply a literal physical call or physical act of prayer, but rather a figurative representation of an intense and heartfelt connection to the divine.
