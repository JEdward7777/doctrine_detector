However, the initial response somewhat dismisses the literal aspect of \"calling out to the Lord\" in prayer, which could be seen as downplaying the importance of fervent, vocal communication with God. It is important to recognize the value of both metaphorical expressions of connection and the physical act of prayer in maintaining a strong relationship with God."
