While the initial interpretation of \"calling out to the Lord\" as a metaphorical expression is valid to a certain extent, it does slightly deviate from the essence of seeking God urgently and wholeheartedly. Hence, a solid understanding of the deeper spiritual connection in prayer would further enhance this response."
