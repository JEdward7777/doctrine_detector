  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly states that predestination refers to God deciding beforehand that certain individuals will receive eternal life. This aligns with the reference answer from the teacher. However, the response lacks additional elaboration or explanation of the theological significance or implications of predestination, which could have elevated the grade."
