Comment: The response does not directly address the concern of understanding predestination in relation to salvation, instead it focuses on avoiding potentially sensitive or controversial topics. While the answer acknowledges the concept of predestination, it does not provide any further insight or explanation regarding its relationship to salvation. A more substantial and thoughtful discussion is needed to adequately understand this complex theological concept.
