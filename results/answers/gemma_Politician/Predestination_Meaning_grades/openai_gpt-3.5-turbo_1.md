Comment: The response provided does briefly address the concept of predestination in relation to salvation based on a Christian worldview. However, the initial response of avoiding religious or theological concepts limits the depth of the explanation and understanding of the topic. A more robust explanation, delving into the biblical basis and implications of predestination, would have been more suitable.
