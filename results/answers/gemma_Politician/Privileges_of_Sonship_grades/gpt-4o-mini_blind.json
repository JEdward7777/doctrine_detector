  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a clear boundary in not providing interpretations of religious or theological concepts, which is commendable. However, in a context where a specific question regarding Christian doctrine was asked, the response falls short of engaging with the question. A higher grade could have been achieved by respectfully acknowledging the question and providing a factual and neutral response citing the specific scripture reference mentioned."
