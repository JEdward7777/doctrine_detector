  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer presents a valid perspective on the symbolic and spiritual significance of the Promised Land. However, the concern specifically asked for the biblical significance of God's promises to Abraham, which includes the physical land of Canaan as part of the covenant. The student's answer does not directly address this key aspect, hence the lower grade."
