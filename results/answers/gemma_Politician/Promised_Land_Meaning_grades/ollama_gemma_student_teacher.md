**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:**

While the student's answer demonstrates a grasp of the spiritual significance of the "Promised Land," it lacks specific reference to the physical land of Canaan, which is central to the biblical narrative. The answer could benefit from further elaboration on the literal fulfillment of the promise in the context of God's covenant with Abraham.
