  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and prophetic nature of the term \"Daughter of Zion\". It also acknowledges the importance of sensitivity and respect when discussing sensitive or controversial topics, which aligns with the concern to recognize the prophetic nature of terms in their historical context. However, I would deduct a few points because the response does not explicitly demonstrate how to apply this understanding to the present day, which is an important aspect of the concern.\n\nComment: The response is well-informed and shows a good understanding of the historical context and prophetic nature of the term \"Daughter of Zion\". To take it to the next level, consider providing examples or guidance on how this understanding can be applied in contemporary contexts."
