The response demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and prophetic nature of the term "Daughter of Zion". It also acknowledges the importance of sensitivity and respect when discussing sensitive or controversial topics, which aligns with the concern to recognize the prophetic nature of terms in their historical context.
