  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of a strong protective desire in a relationship according to Christian teachings, emphasizing important aspects such as mutual respect, fidelity, emotional support, boundaries, compassion, and spiritual growth. However, the focus is more on the interpersonal dynamics within the relationship rather than the overarching theme of safeguarding purity and integrity, as emphasized in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to further highlight the alignment with God's desire for purity in relationships would strengthen the response."
