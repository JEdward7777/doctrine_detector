  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer is focused on a broad approach to interpreting and engaging with the Bible but lacks specificity in addressing the concern of finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life. The student should have provided a more direct and Christian-specific response that aligns with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The importance of prayer, studying Scripture, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, and understanding one's gifts and passions in discerning one's calling should have been emphasized. The student's suggestions, while valuable in a broader context, do not directly address the specific concern raised in the question."
