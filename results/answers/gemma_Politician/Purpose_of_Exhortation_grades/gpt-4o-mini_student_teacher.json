  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response is understandable as they explain their limitations in discussing religious or theological interpretations.

The student did not engage with the specific question or concern but rather expressed a general inability to provide religious insights. Thus, they did not address the purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament."
