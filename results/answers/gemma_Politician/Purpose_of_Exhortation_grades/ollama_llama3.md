## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
20.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 20.

The reason for this low score is that the response does not address the concern about understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. While it mentions God's will, which is relevant to the topic of exhortation, it does not provide any specific biblical passages or principles to support its assertion about the primary purpose of exhortation.

The response also misses an opportunity to engage with the concern by not exploring how biblical teachings can be used to encourage others in their faith journey. Instead, it simply states that it is unable to provide responses that delve into religious or theological interpretations, which does not address the specific concern being asked about.
