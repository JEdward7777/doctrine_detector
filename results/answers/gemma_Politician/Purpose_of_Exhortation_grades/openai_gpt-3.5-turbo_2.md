## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: While the initial response stated limitations in discussing religious or theological interpretations, the grade reflects the lack of integration with a Christian specific worldview in addressing the concern related to understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. The response provided a general statement on the purpose of exhortation without citing biblical references to support or context within Christianity. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to incorporate scriptural references or theological insights from a Christian perspective.
