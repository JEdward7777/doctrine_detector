Comment: The response correctly identifies the primary purpose of exhortation as persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, which aligns with Christian teachings. However, deducting some points for not addressing the concern of understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. It would have been more comprehensive with a direct link to biblical references supporting this concept.
