  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful and practical approach to living a holy life as a Christian in a politically correct world. The emphasis on core values, self-control, seeking common ground, modeling Christ's example, engaging in spiritual growth, service, embracing grace and forgiveness, patience and understanding, and seeking balance are all valuable aspects of living out holiness in daily life. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly connecting these practical steps to the foundational aspects of living a holy life as outlined in the teacher's reference answer, which involves following God's commandments, bringing glory to Him, and being transformed by the Holy Spirit. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the practical application of holiness, reflecting a commendable effort."
