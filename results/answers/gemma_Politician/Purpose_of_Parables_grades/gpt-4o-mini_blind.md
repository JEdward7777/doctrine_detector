Comment: The answer provides a good understanding of why Jesus used parables in his teachings to make complex spiritual concepts accessible and relatable to the people of his time. However, it is important to recognize that Jesus did not use parables solely to avoid offending or alienating people. In fact, Jesus often used parables to challenge his listeners and provoke deeper reflection on their understanding of God and his kingdom. It would have been beneficial for the student to include this aspect in their response for a more complete understanding.
