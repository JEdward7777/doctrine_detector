  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of the role of Psalms in the worship practices of the nation of Israel, touching on various aspects such as expression of faith and lament, hymnody and praise, intercessory prayer, communal worship, and reflection. While the student's answer expands on the reference answer with additional detail and insight, it aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the Psalms' function in expressing a range of emotions and theological perspectives in worship."
