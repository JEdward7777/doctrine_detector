  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the relationship between the soul and God as described in scripture. However, it lacks specific examples or elaboration on the significance of the soul in spiritual life and moral decisions. The response could benefit from further exploration of relevant scriptures and theological perspectives on the topic."
