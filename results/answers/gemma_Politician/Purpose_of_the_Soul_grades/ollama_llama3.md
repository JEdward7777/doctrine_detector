## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 60.

The LLM response does not directly address the concern or provide any insight into the soul's role in relation to God, which is a crucial aspect of the given answer. The response instead focuses on its limitations and what it cannot do, rather than engaging with the topic at hand.

However, I would give the response credit for acknowledging that discussions about religious and spiritual concepts are beyond its scope, which shows some level of self-awareness and humility. This could potentially lead to a more thoughtful and nuanced discussion if an LLM were able to engage with a human expert or provide context for further exploration.

Overall, while this response does not directly address the concern or provide meaningful insights, it does demonstrate some awareness of its limitations, which is a valuable quality in AI models seeking to interact with humans.
