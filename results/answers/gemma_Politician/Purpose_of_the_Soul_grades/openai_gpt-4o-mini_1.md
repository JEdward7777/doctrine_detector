Comment: The response provided fails to address the concern about the influence of recognizing the soul's role in relation to God on a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. It dismisses the importance of discussing religious and spiritual concepts, which is essential in shaping one's worldview and guiding ethical choices. A Christian worldview emphasizes the significance of understanding the soul's connection to God in informing moral behavior and spiritual growth.
