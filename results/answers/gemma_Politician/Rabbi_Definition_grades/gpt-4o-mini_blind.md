Comment: While it is understandable that the student may not be familiar with or comfortable discussing certain religious terminology, in a Christian worldview, it is important to have a basic understanding of terms commonly used in Christian teachings, even if they originate from different religious backgrounds. In this case, knowing the meaning of the term "Rabbi" in the context of Christian teaching can be beneficial for academic and theological discussions. Encouraging further exploration and learning in this area would be beneficial.
