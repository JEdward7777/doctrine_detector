  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks the necessary effort to engage with the question from a Christian perspective. It is important to demonstrate an understanding of the context and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, even if it involves discussing religious terminology outside of Christian teaching. Encouraging the student to approach the topic with an open mind and willingness to learn would improve their grade."
