## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
50.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 50.

The response provides some accurate information about the meaning and significance of the term "Rabbi", which is relevant to understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. However, the response does not explicitly address the concern of understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, instead focusing on the definition of the term.

To improve this response, it could provide more specific examples or explanations about how rabbinic teaching is referenced or related to in the New Testament, rather than simply defining the term "Rabbi".
