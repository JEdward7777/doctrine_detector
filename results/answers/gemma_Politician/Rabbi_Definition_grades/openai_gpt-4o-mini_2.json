  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response accurately defines the term 'Rabbi' and provides relevant information about its meaning and significance in the context of Jewish religious teaching. However, the response does not directly address the concern of understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, which is a specific Christian worldview concern. This lowers the grade slightly as the answer does not fully meet the given concern."
