## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
50.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: While the response appropriately acknowledges the need for discussing religious concepts with qualified scholars or leaders, it lacks an actual attempt to address the question from a Christian perspective. Encouragement to seek guidance from appropriate sources should be coupled with a brief explanation or summary of the significance of Jesus being referred to as a ransom in Christianity to demonstrate some engagement with the topic.
