Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of Jesus' sacrifice as a ransom and its significance for redemption. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of redemption and its implications for salvation within a Christian worldview. The only deduction is due to the initial statement of inability to interpret religious concepts, which could have been avoided with a direct engagement on the topic.
