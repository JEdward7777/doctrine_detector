Comment: The response correctly explains the concept of redemption in a Christian context, linking it to the idea of Jesus' sacrifice as ransom for sinners. The answer demonstrates a sound understanding of the theological implications of redemption for salvation from a Christian worldview. However, deducting a few points for not directly engaging with the concern raised about the concept of redemption and its implications for salvation.
