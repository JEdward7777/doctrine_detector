  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90.\n\nThe student accurately states that the apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers to remember and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which aligns with Christian beliefs and teachings. However, they could have further elaborated on the significance and symbolism of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective."
