## Question [Relation to Atonement](../../questions/Relation_to_Atonement.md)
How does the term 'propitiation' relate to the term 'atonement'?

## Target answer from notes
Propitiation is closely related to atonement, as both involve reconciliation between God and humanity, but propitiation emphasizes appeasing God's wrath specifically.

To clarify the differences and similarities between these two important theological terms.

## Answer given by [gemma Politician](../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Both 'propitiation' and 'atonement' suggest the act of making amends for past wrongs or offenses. However, there are subtle differences in their connotations.

**Propitiation** implies a deliberate attempt to appease or conciliate someone who is angry or dissatisfied. It often involves offering something valuable or desirable as a gesture of submission or reconciliation.

**Atone** carries a deeper and more spiritual significance. It suggests a genuine remorse for past actions and a sincere desire to repair the damage caused. The act of atonement involves genuine self-reflection, apology, and a commitment to making amends.

Therefore, while both terms are related to the idea of making amends, **atonement implies a more profound and lasting transformation** than propitiation.
