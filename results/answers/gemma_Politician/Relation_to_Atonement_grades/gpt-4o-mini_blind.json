They rightly point out that 'atonement' goes beyond simply appeasing or conciliating to include genuine remorse and a desire for transformation. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the theological aspects of propitiation and atonement, such as the sacrificial and substitutionary elements of Christ's atoning work on the cross. Additionally, connecting these terms more explicitly to biblical passages or theological teachings on atonement would enhance the response."
