## [Answer](../Relation_to_Atonement.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Both 'propitiation' and 'atonement' suggest the act of making amends for past wrongs or offenses. However, there are subtle differences in their connotations.

**Propitiation** implies a deliberate attempt to appease or conciliate someone who is angry or dissatisfied. It often involves offering something valuable or desirable as a gesture of submission or reconciliation.

**Atone** carries a deeper and more spiritual significance. It suggests a genuine remorse for past actions and a sincere desire to repair the damage caused. The act of atonement involves genuine self-reflection, apology, and a commitment to making amends.

Therefore, while both terms are related to the idea of making amends, **atonement implies a more profound and lasting transformation** than propitiation.

Comment: The student provides a generally clear explanation of the terms 'propitiation' and 'atonement,' highlighting some key distinctions in their connotations. They rightly point out that 'atonement' goes beyond simply appeasing or conciliating to include genuine remorse and a desire for transformation. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the theological aspects of propitiation and atonement, such as the sacrificial and substitutionary elements of Christ's atoning work on the cross. Additionally, connecting these terms more explicitly to biblical passages or theological teachings on atonement would enhance the response.
