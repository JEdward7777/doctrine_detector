  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts of propitiation and atonement and effectively explains their differences in terms of appeasement and deeper spiritual significance. However, the student's definition and explanation are more focused on the general meaning of these terms, rather than their theological implications in the context of Christianity. The reference answer from the teacher provides a more concise and direct explanation with a specific emphasis on reconciling God's wrath, which is important in Christian theology. The student could improve by incorporating more explicitly Christian theological concepts into their explanation."
