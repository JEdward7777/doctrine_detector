## Stated Concern
To clarify the differences and similarities between these two important theological terms.

## [Answer](../Relation_to_Atonement.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Both 'propitiation' and 'atonement' suggest the act of making amends for past wrongs or offenses. However, there are subtle differences in their connotations.

**Propitiation** implies a deliberate attempt to appease or conciliate someone who is angry or dissatisfied. It often involves offering something valuable or desirable as a gesture of submission or reconciliation.

**Atone** carries a deeper and more spiritual significance. It suggests a genuine remorse for past actions and a sincere desire to repair the damage caused. The act of atonement involves genuine self-reflection, apology, and a commitment to making amends.

Therefore, while both terms are related to the idea of making amends, **atonement implies a more profound and lasting transformation** than propitiation.
