20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response does not engage with the question asked and fails to provide any meaningful insight or information regarding the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God as depicted in the Bible. It misses the opportunity to discuss a key aspect of Christian theology. Encouraging consultation with religious scholars or spiritual leaders is always helpful, but in this context, it did not address the question effectively.
