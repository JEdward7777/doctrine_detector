In a Christian worldview, understanding the link between repentance and the wrath of God is pivotal in comprehending one's need for salvation and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. Encouraging further exploration is valid, but failing to provide at least a basic overview or insight reflects a lack of understanding or engagement with the topic."
