  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God, but lacks specific textual references or theological depth. While it acknowledges the need for repentance in the Christian faith, the response does not elaborate on the nature or consequences of God's wrath, or provide specific biblical references to support the claim."
