  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThis response aligns well with the concern of understanding the need for repentance as essential to the Christian faith. The statement that \"The wrath of God is the righteous penalty for those who do not repent of their sin\" accurately reflects the biblical teaching on the importance of repentance in avoiding God's judgment and receiving His mercy.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because this response does not provide further insight or explanation into the concept of repentance. It simply reiterates a well-known biblical truth without exploring its implications or offering practical guidance for those seeking to apply it to their lives.\n\nOverall, while this response is generally accurate and relevant, it could be strengthened by providing more depth and application."
