  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The student did not directly answer the question regarding who replaced Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. They missed the opportunity to provide the accurate biblical response which is Matthias. The given answer seems to be avoiding the question rather than engaging with the content related to apostolic leadership and continuity. Hence, the grade reflects the failure to address the question in a theologically relevant manner."
