  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response directly addresses the concern by providing accurate information about Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death. The response also shows an understanding of the historical context, which aligns with the Christian worldview's emphasis on biblical accuracy. The only deduction is for not explicitly stating the connection between Matthias' selection and the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, which is implied but not directly addressed. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the relevant biblical events and their significance in the context of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership."
