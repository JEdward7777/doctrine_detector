Grade: 95

Comment: The response accurately addresses the concern by acknowledging the continuity of apostolic leadership after Judas Iscariot's betrayal. It correctly states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas among the twelve apostles. The deduction in points is due to the initial mention of not providing speculation or inaccurate historical information, which was unnecessary in this context.
