Grade: 20

Comment: While the response appropriately acknowledges the limitations of providing religious interpretations, it does not provide any insight or information related to what the Bible says is required for a person to be saved. Encouraging consultation with religious scholars or authorities is commendable, but the response could have at least alluded to some biblical references on the topic.
