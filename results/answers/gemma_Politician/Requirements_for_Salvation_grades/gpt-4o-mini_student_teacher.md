## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response lacks engagement with the question's core aspect about what the Bible says is required for salvation. While it is appropriate to refer religious matters to scholars, the response could have at least acknowledged the central tenet of faith and repentance as the basis for salvation according to Christian beliefs.
