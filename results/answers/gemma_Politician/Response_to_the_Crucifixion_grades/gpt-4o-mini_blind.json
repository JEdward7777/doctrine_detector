  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks the necessary engagement with the question. While it is important to respect religious beliefs, the response failed to address the question about Peter's address to the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. The student should have made an effort to provide a response grounded in the biblical text and Christian teachings."
