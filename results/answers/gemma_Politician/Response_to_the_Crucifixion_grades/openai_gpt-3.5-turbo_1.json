It aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the role of God in raising Jesus to life and the necessity of responding to the gospel with repentance and faith. The only minor deduction is for not directly addressing the need for personal response and commitment to Jesus in the answer, as this is typically a key element in early church preaching."
