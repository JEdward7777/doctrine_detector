  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75\n\n**Comment:** While the student's response avoids expressing explicit religious or theological opinions, it demonstrates a grasp of the concept of reconciliation in the Christian faith. It correctly suggests that restoration involves healing the broken relationship between God and sinful people. However, the response lacks depth and does not elaborate on the specific mechanisms or processes of restoration."
