Comment: The student's answer is mostly accurate in defining the term 'resurrection' in a Christian context by mentioning Jesus Christ's resurrection and its significance for believers. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the broader concept of resurrection as the act of becoming alive again after death, underlining God's power in this miraculous event. It is essential to understand that the belief in resurrection extends beyond Jesus' resurrection to encompass the hope of eternal life for all believers.
