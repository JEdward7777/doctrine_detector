  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of resurrection, particularly in the context of Christian theology. It accurately describes Jesus' resurrection as an example of God's power to bring someone back to life. However, the response could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting this concept to the fundamental Christian beliefs about life after death, which is highlighted as a concern. The answer provided does not fully address this concern, but it still shows a good foundation for further exploration and understanding.\n\nNote: I've given 85 points because the response demonstrates a clear grasp of the concept of resurrection, but could be more detailed in its connection to Christian beliefs about life after death."
