  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that addresses the concern of reconciling God's wrath with His loving and merciful nature from a Christian worldview. They have effectively emphasized the importance of understanding the context, recognizing God's mercy, balancing perspectives, contextualizing wrath, focusing on forgiveness, avoiding judgmentalism, and emphasizing God's character. The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, showcasing a solid understanding of the topic. However, there could be a bit more emphasis on the central role of God's justice and holiness in maintaining His righteousness, as highlighted in the reference answer."
