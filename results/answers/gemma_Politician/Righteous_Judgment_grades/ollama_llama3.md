Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a good foundation for understanding God's wrath, highlighting its connection to His justice and holiness. It also acknowledges His love and mercy through salvation and forgiveness. However, it could be more comprehensive in addressing the concern of how God's attributes coexist without contradiction.

Some areas that are not fully addressed include:

* The response does not explicitly address the temporary nature of God's wrath or its disciplinary purpose.
* While it mentions God's love and mercy, it could provide more depth on how these attributes balance with His justice and wrath.
* There is no mention of forgiveness as an expression of God's love, which is an important aspect of Christian theology.

To improve this response, the writer could elaborate on these points to demonstrate a deeper understanding of how God's attributes coexist without contradiction.
