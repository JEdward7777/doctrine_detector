It aligns well with the concern of understanding how God's attributes coexist without contradiction in Biblical teaching. The response could be strengthened by further emphasizing the interconnectedness of God's attributes, particularly by expanding on how God's wrath is a reflection of His righteousness and is not in conflict with His love and mercy."
