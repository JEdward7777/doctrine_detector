## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While the student's response reflects humility in deferring to religious authorities for interpretation, it misses the opportunity to engage with the question from a Christian worldview. In the context of a Christian perspective, it is important to address such theological topics, including the service of angels to God, based on biblical references. Encouraging the student to explore this aspect within the Christian faith would have enriched the response.
