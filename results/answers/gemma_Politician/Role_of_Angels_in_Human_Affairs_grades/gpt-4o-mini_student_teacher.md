## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student showed respect for seeking guidance from religious or spiritual authorities, which is commendable. However, they missed the opportunity to engage with the question and provide a basic understanding of the biblical references concerning angels' service to God. Encouraging the exploration of Scripture and theological teachings could have enhanced the response.
