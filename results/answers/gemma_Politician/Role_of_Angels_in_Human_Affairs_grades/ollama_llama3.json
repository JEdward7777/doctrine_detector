  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response is generally accurate and acknowledges the various roles of angels as mentioned in Scripture (delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening God's people). However, it does not provide theological depth or nuance to the topic, which is an important consideration given the concern about understanding divine intervention. Additionally, while the response suggests that angels communicate on behalf of God, it does not explore the nature of this communication or its implications for Christian understanding. Nevertheless, the response acknowledges the limitations of human interpretation and encourages seeking guidance from religious authorities, which demonstrates a humility and respect for the mystery of angelic service.\n\nTo improve, the response could delve deeper into biblical passages that describe angelic activity, exploring the implications for Christian life and faith."
