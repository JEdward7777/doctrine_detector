Grade: 60

Comment: The response acknowledges the role of angels in serving God and provides relevant examples of their functions. However, the initial response indicating a reluctance to discuss theological claims may hinder a deeper exploration of how understanding these roles can impact Christians' perspectives on divine intervention. Encouraging engagement with theological discussions would have strengthened the overall response.
