Grade: 80

Comment: The response acknowledges the role of angels in serving God and their impact on divine intervention in the lives of Christians. However, by deferring theological interpretations to religious authorities, the student misses an opportunity to reflect and engage critically with the Christian worldview on angels. Encouraging proactive engagement with one's beliefs would have enhanced the response further.
