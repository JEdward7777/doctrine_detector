Grade: 75

Comment: The response acknowledges the roles of angels in serving God according to Christian beliefs, which is a good start. However, the initial statement that defers theological claims to religious authorities might suggest a lack of personal understanding or engagement with the topic. It is important for individuals to seek personal understanding and reflection on theological matters as well, alongside consulting religious authorities. A slightly lower grade is given due to the initial hesitation to engage with the topic, despite providing a correct perspective on the roles of angels in Christian theology.
