However, the focus on political correctness in the recommendations detracts from the Christian-specific worldview and the core teachings of the apostles. It would have been beneficial to emphasize the foundational aspects of teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer as highlighted in the reference answer to align more closely with a Christian worldview."
