  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does touch on some aspects of community building and teaching as modeled by the apostles, such as emphasizing fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer. However, it only provides a very brief overview of their actions and does not delve deeper into specific examples or applications to contemporary church life. The concern was to understand community and teaching as integral aspects of church life, but this response only scratches the surface.\n\nTo improve, the response could provide more concrete examples from the apostles' lives and teachings, such as how they engaged with diverse perspectives, demonstrated compassion and empathy, and built inclusive communities. Additionally, it would be helpful to draw more explicit connections between the apostles' actions and modern-day applications for building strong, unified churches."
