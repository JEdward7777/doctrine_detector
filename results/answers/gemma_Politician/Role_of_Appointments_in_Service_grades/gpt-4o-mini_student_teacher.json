However, the answer does not directly address the concern of believers fulfilling their appointed roles within the Church by serving others, using their gifts, and advancing God's kingdom. Encouraging them to connect their beliefs with practical actions within the Church would enhance the quality of their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
