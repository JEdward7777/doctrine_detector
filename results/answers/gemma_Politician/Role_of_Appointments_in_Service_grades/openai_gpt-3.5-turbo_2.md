Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of Christians fulfilling their appointed tasks in serving others within the body of Christ and advancing God's kingdom. It aligns well with a Christian worldview emphasizing service and using gifts for the edification of the Church. The deductive points are given for the initial statement about political correctness and adhering to biblical principles, which, while relevant, could have been connected more directly to the concern at hand.
