60.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The student expressed a valid concern about the sensitivity of the topic, which is commendable. However, given the context of the question within the framework of understanding God's plan for individuals in society, the response falls short in addressing the question directly from a Christian perspective. Encouragement to explore the topic within the principles of Christian theology and biblical teachings would have strengthened the answer.
