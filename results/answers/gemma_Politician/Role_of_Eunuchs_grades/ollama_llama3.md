## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively highlights the value and purpose of individuals in God's kingdom, regardless of their physical or social status, which aligns with the concern. However, it would have been more impactful if the response had explicitly connected this concept to the biblical narrative, such as pointing out how God used people like Esther, Joseph, or even Jesus himself despite their humble beginnings or perceived limitations. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the value of all individuals in God's kingdom and earns an 85.
