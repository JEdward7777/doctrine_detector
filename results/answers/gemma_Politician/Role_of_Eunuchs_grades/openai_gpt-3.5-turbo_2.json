  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of recognizing the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, emphasizing that God can use anyone for His purposes regardless of physical or social status. It aligns well with the concern provided, reflecting a Christian worldview perspective. The deductive points for not directly addressing the specific example of eunuchs in historical or social context are minimal, as the focus on God's sovereignty and ability to use all individuals appropriately addresses the concern."
