However, it lacks doctrinal depth and fails to explicitly connect Jesus as the Messiah to the concept of the kingdom in a robust biblical manner. It is important for the student to delve deeper into the biblical foundations and theological implications of Jesus as the Messiah establishing the kingdom of God on earth. The answer should also clearly articulate the significance of Jesus' role in bringing about the kingdom in fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. Additionally, there should be a stronger emphasis on the redemptive and salvific aspects of Jesus' Messianic role in relation to the kingdom of God."
