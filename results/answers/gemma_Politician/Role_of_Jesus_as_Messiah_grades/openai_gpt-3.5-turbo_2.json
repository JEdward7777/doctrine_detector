It acknowledges the significance of Jesus' role in God's plan for humanity, aligning well with the concern provided. The reference to Jesus ruling over the kingdom forever adds depth to the theological understanding. The only area for improvement could be a slightly more detailed exploration of how Jesus' reign impacts and pertains to the concept of the kingdom of God."
