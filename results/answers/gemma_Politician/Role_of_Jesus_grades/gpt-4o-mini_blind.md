Comment: While it is important to respect different perspectives and defer to religious authorities for specific theological interpretations, a better response would have at least briefly mentioned the basic Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God who sacrificed himself for the salvation of humanity. Striking a balance between neutrality and providing factual information within a religious context is crucial.
