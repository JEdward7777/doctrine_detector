  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response acknowledges the importance of clarifying Jesus' role in salvation, but it avoids providing any theological interpretations or biases. While the response could be improved by elaborating on the specific biblical passages or verses that support the claim about Jesus' role in salvation, it adequately addresses the concern from the teacher's perspective."
