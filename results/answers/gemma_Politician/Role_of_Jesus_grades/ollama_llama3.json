  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that Jesus plays a central role in salvation, which aligns with the concern about clarifying His role. However, it stops short of providing a more detailed and nuanced explanation of Jesus' role as Savior, which is essential for comprehending the Christian faith and redemption.\n\nAdditionally, while the response suggests consulting religious authorities for further theological inquiry, it does not provide any scriptural basis or supporting evidence to back up its claim that Jesus is central to salvation. A more thoughtful and engaging response would have explored the biblical passages that establish Jesus' role as Savior and Redeemer.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest providing more biblical support and elaborating on what it means for Jesus to be central to salvation."
