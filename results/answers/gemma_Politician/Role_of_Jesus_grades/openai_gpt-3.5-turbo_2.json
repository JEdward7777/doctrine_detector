  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the importance of Jesus in salvation, it falls short in addressing the concern raised regarding clarifying Jesus' role in understanding the Christian faith and redemption. It missed the opportunity to elaborate on the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection as central to Christian beliefs. Therefore, the grade reflects the partial engagement with the identified concern."
