  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the historical context and challenges the commonly held belief that Jewish religious leaders were directly responsible for Jesus' crucifixion. While it is true that religious authority often intersects with civil power, the student appropriately points out the lack of credible evidence to support the claim that Jewish religious leaders specifically influenced the Roman governor's decision. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration and engagement with the provided reference answer."
