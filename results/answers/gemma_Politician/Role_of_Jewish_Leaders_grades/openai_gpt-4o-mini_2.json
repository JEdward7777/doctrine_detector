It appropriately acknowledges the role of the Jewish religious leaders in influencing the decision to crucify Jesus based on rejecting Him as the Messiah. The deduction in points is due to the lack of acknowledgment of the Christian belief that Jesus' crucifixion ultimately served a redemptive purpose."
