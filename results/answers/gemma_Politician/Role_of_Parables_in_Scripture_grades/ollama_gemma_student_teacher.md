## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 50

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the role of parables in biblical narratives. While it is true that Nathan's confrontation with David did not involve a literal parable as defined in other contexts, the narrative clearly employs a parabolic structure through the use of an imaginative story to convey a spiritual truth.
