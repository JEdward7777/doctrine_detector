20.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 20.

The response is incorrect, stating that Nathan did not use a parable in his confrontation with David, when in fact, the biblical account shows that Nathan told King David a parable (2 Samuel 12:1-14). This discrepancy alone accounts for most of the points deducted. Additionally, the response does not demonstrate an understanding of the concern about the use of parables as means of correction and revelation.

The comment on the grade is: "This response demonstrates a lack of biblical knowledge and understanding of the significance of parables in biblical narratives. A correct analysis would show that Nathan's use of a parable was a intentional means of revealing David's sin and leading him to repentance, highlighting the importance of using narrative methods for correction and revelation."
