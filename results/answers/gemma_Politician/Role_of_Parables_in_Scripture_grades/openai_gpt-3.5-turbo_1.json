  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response is mostly accurate in recognizing the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. The mentioned concern is addressed appropriately, but the original response's claim that the prophet Nathan did not utilize a parable in his confrontation with King David is incorrect."
