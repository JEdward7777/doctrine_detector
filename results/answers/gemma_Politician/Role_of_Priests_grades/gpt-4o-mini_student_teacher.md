Comment: While it is understandable that the student's intention is to remain neutral and respectful of diverse beliefs, in this context where the question specifically asks about the biblical role of priests in the Old Testament, a direct reference to the Bible is necessary. The student could have presented the information from a general perspective without delving into interpretations or analyses of religious texts.
