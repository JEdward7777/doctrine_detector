  "grade": 0.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 0.\n\nThis response does not address the concern of understanding the biblical role of priests at all. Instead, it focuses on its own limitations and inability to provide interpretations or analyses of religious texts. While this response may be acknowledging the importance of respecting diverse beliefs, it is not relevant to the concern of understanding the biblical role of priests.\n\nThe given answer about the main responsibilities of priests does not seem to have any connection to this response, making it even more disconnected from the concern. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 0."
