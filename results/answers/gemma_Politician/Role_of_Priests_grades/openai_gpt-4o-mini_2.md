Grade: 20

Comment: While it's important to respect diverse beliefs, in this specific case, the response missed the opportunity to provide a Christian worldview perspective on the biblical role of priests. It is essential to engage with the biblical text and offer insights from a Christian perspective when discussing religious roles such as priests.
