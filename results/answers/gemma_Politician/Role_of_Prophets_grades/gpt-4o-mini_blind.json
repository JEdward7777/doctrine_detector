Providing a brief overview of the primary role of a prophet as a messenger of God, foretelling future events, calling people to repentance, and speaking on behalf of God would have been more aligned with a Christian perspective. It is important to prioritize doctrinal correctness and provide insight based on the foundational beliefs of Christianity when discussing Biblical topics."
