Comment: While the response correctly states the complexity of the role of a prophet according to the Bible and the ongoing debates around it, a Christian-specific worldview would expect a more direct reference to Biblical teachings. Providing a brief overview of the primary role of a prophet as a messenger of God, foretelling future events, calling people to repentance, and speaking on behalf of God would have been more aligned with a Christian perspective. It is important to prioritize doctrinal correctness and provide insight based on the foundational beliefs of Christianity when discussing Biblical topics.
