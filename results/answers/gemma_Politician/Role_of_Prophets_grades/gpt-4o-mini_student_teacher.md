Grade: 60

Comment: While the student correctly highlighted the complexity and interpretation of the role of a prophet according to the Bible, they missed addressing the key aspect emphasized in the reference answer - that a prophet primarily speaks God's messages to the people, including calls for repentance and obedience. It would have been beneficial for the student to acknowledge this central theme while still maintaining an objective stance.
