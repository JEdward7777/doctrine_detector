Comment: The student failed to address the question and the concern provided, avoiding the topic altogether. A Christian perspective values seeking knowledge and understanding of historical and religious contexts, even if they may be sensitive or contentious. In this case, the student should have attempted to provide an answer within the boundaries of respect and academic exploration.
