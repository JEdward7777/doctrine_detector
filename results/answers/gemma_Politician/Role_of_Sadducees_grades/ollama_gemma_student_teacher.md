**Comment:** While the student's response avoids potentially contentious topics, it lacks specific elaboration on the Sadducees' responsibilities in the Jewish temple system. It adequately addresses the literal question but doesn't delve into the historical context or the broader significance of the Sadducees within the religious landscape. Including more detailed information about their specific roles and functions would elevate the quality of the response.
