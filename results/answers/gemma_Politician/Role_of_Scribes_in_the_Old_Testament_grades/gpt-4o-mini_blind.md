Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response fails to address the question directly. They should have mentioned the responsibilities of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures from a historical and religious perspective. Encouraging consultation of reputable sources is good, but the lack of a proper answer lowers the grade significantly.
