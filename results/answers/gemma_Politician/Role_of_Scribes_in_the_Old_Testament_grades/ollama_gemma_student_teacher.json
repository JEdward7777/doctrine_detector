  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a factual understanding of the scribes' role in preserving the Old Testament scriptures. However, it lacks additional elaboration or analysis of the significance of this role from a Christian specific worldview. The response could benefit from further elaboration on the theological or doctrinal significance of the scribes' work in preserving the scriptures within Christian tradition."
