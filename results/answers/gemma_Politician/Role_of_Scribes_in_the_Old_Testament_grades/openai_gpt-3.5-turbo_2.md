Comment: The response effectively acknowledges the significance of the scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures by emphasizing their role in copying and ensuring accuracy. The answer demonstrates an understanding of the importance of the scribes' work in biblical history and the transmission of scripture. The only minor deduction is due to the initial disclaimer, which, although understandable, could have been phrased more positively or with a clearer connection to a Christian worldview perspective.
