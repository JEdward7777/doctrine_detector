  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the role of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message from a Christian perspective. It provides well-reasoned and comprehensive explanations of how the Bible illustrates the use of Scripture in various aspects of evangelism. The student's ability to connect biblical references to their relevance in contemporary society is commendable. However, including specific examples from the Bible, such as the accounts of Philip and Paul, would further strengthen the answer and align it more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
