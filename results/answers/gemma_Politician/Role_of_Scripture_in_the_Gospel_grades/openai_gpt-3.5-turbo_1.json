It aligns well with the Christian worldview by highlighting the importance of Scripture in communicating the Gospel message. Additionally, the broader discussion on the integration of Scripture in sharing the Gospel through emphasizing its authority, historical context, God's character, addressing cultural issues, moral foundation, and empowering individuals further strengthens the response."
