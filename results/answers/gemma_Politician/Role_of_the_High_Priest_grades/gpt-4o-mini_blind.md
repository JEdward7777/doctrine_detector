## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
50.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: The response is well intentioned in advising to consult reliable sources, but it fails to address the question directly. It would have been more appropriate to briefly mention that the high priest held unique responsibilities such as entering the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement.
