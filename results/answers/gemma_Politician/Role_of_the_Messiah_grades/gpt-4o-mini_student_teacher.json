  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student stated their limitations on providing interpretations or beliefs on religious concepts, the concern here is the clarity on the role of the Messiah from a Christian perspective. The student's response lacks engagement with the specific roles the Messiah fulfilled according to the Bible, which would have helped believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority better. A higher grade could have been achieved by at least outlining the roles of the Messiah as prophet, priest, king, and bearer of the New Covenant as mentioned in the reference answer."
