  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a factual understanding of the roles of the Messiah according to the Bible, providing a concise summary of the prophet, priest, and king titles associated with the Messiah. However, it lacks elaboration and fails to address the concern regarding clarity on the Messiah's mission and authority, which could have enhanced the overall depth of the response."
