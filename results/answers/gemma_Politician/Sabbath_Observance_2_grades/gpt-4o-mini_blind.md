Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response does not engage with the question at all and fails to address the topic of how God instructed the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath from a Christian worldview. The response lacks any attempt to incorporate knowledge or understanding of the Bible's teachings on this specific subject. More effort is needed to connect with the Christian perspective on the question.
