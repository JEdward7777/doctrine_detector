Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands by referencing the instruction given to the Israelites regarding gathering manna before the Sabbath. However, the initial disclaimer about the inability to provide interpretations or historical information about religious concepts somewhat detracts from a full engagement with the concern presented. The response could have expounded more on the significance of Sabbath observance in the context of God's commands to enhance the Christian worldview perspective.
