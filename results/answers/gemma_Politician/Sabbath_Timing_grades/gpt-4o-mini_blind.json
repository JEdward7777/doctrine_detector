  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While it is important to be respectful of all perspectives, the student's response lacks the necessary information to answer the question effectively. In a religious studies context, it is crucial to provide accurate information based on the specific beliefs and practices of the faith being discussed. In this case, not providing information related to Jewish tradition hinders the overall understanding of the subject matter. Strive to incorporate appropriate and relevant details while maintaining respect for diverse beliefs."
