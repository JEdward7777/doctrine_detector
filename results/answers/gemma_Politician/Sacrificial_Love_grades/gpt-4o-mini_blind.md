Grade: 65

Comment: The response provides a thoughtful and comprehensive exploration of loving others sacrificially in the political context; however, it is lacking in connecting these principles specifically to the example of Jesus' sacrificial love. To improve, the student should clearly integrate biblical references or principles demonstrating Jesus' sacrificial love and how that can be applied in a political context.
