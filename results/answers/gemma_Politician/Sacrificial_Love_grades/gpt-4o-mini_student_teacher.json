  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough explanation of loving others sacrificially in a political context, the response did not directly address the essence of God's love as demonstrated by Jesus and how it should reflect in personal relationships. The student could improve by connecting the concept to Jesus' sacrificial love on the cross and its implications for personal relationships, aligning more closely with the Christian worldview."
