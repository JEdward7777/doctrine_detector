  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a clear explanation of the Sadducees' beliefs regarding the resurrection and effectively contrasts them with Christian teachings on the subject. It correctly highlights the doctrinal differences between the two perspectives, emphasizing the central role of the resurrection in Christianity. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the theological implications and scriptural interpretations related to this topic. However, to improve the grade further, they could have provided more depth in discussing the theological significance of Christ's resurrection for Christian salvation and the implications for believers' daily lives."
