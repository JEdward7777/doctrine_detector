Grade: 40

Comment: The student correctly acknowledges the sensitive nature of drawing comparisons with historical events or individuals in this context. However, the response lacks engagement with the specific question asked, which is to discuss how Samson's story illustrates the implications of the Nazirite vow. Encouragement to provide a more focused and potentially insightful response would be beneficial.
