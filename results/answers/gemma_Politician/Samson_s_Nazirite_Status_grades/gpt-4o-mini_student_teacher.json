  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely missed the mark in addressing the question and concern. It lacks any attempt to engage with the biblical narrative of Samson and the implications of the Nazirite vow. Additionally, it does not demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. The student needs to improve their ability to analyze and discuss biblical concepts within a Christian worldview."
