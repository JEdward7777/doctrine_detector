Grade: 95

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring how Samson's strength was linked to his commitment to the Nazirite vow, showcasing the connection between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. The only slight deduction is due to the response not directly comparing Samson's situation to contemporary political ideologies, as suggested in the concern.
