  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate overview of the sanctification process as described in the New Testament. It correctly highlights key aspects such as justification, transformation, growth in obedience, and the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification. The student effectively references relevant Bible verses to support their points and offers practical steps for believers to engage in the sanctification process. The emphasis on God's grace, ongoing transformation, and the communal aspect of sanctification aligns well with Christian doctrine. Well done!"
