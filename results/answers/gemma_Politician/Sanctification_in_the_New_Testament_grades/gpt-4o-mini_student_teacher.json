  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 50/100. \n\nThe student provided a detailed and well-organized explanation of the sanctification process as described in the New Testament, including key aspects and practical implications for believers. However, the student did not directly address the concern of recognizing the role of faith in the sanctification process. \n\nIn a Christian worldview, faith is crucial in sanctification as it is through faith in Jesus Christ that believers are justified and empowered by the Holy Spirit for transformation. The student's answer would have been stronger if they explicitly tied in the importance of faith in the sanctification process described in the New Testament."
