* **Growth in obedience:** Following Jesus' commands and living in accordance with his teachings. (John 14:21)
* **Sanctification as a process:** It is ongoing and continues throughout a believer's life. (1 Thessalonians 5:23)

The New Testament emphasizes that sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit within believers. God's grace and power are essential for transformation to occur.
