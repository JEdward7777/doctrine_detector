Comment: While it is understandable that the student may not feel qualified to provide interpretations of religious texts or terminology, in this case, a basic understanding or research on the term "sanctuary" in the Bible should be provided. It is important to at least attempt to address the question within the context of a Christian worldview. In this case, the answer falls short of providing any meaningful insight into the term as it relates to the Bible.
