**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a factual understanding of the definition of 'sanctuary' as a holy place in the Bible. However, it lacks additional elaboration or contextualization of the term within scripture. The response could benefit from referencing relevant scripture passages or providing more elaborate examples from biblical accounts to support the definition.
