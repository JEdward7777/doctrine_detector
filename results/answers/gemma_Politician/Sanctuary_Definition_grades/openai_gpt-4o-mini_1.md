Comment: The response correctly defines the term 'sanctuary' in the Biblical context as a holy place connected to God and a place of protection and safety. However, the initial disclaimer stating the inability to provide interpretations or analysis of religious texts detracts from the overall response. It is important to acknowledge and engage with religious concepts, especially when discussing Biblical terms and meanings within a Christian worldview.
