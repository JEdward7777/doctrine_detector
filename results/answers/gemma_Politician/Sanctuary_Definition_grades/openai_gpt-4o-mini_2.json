  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90. The student accurately defines the term 'sanctuary' in the Biblical context, addressing the concern raised. The acknowledgment of the term's significance in relation to the tabernacle or temple demonstrates an understanding of its importance within Christian teachings. The response is clear, concise, and directly addresses the concern at hand. The only reason for deducting a few points is the initial disclaimer about providing interpretations of religious texts, which could have been expressed more confidently."
