Comment: While it is important to acknowledge limitations in providing interpretations of religious texts, in this case, the question specifically asks about how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament. As such, the student could have mentioned fundamental aspects such as God's presence among His people, the symbolism of the sanctuary in relation to purity and atonement, and the expected reverence and holiness in approaching the sanctuary. Encouraging deeper engagement with the question would have significantly improved the response.
