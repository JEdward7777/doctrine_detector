  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid overview of Bible verses that emphasize the practice of intercession for others. The selection of verses is appropriate and the explanations provided are clear. The additional principles given for intercession are relevant and offer practical guidance. The response could be enhanced by including more direct verses specifically focused on interceding for others and by incorporating further Scriptural references to support the principles outlined. Overall, a good effort showcasing understanding of intercessory prayer based on a Christian worldview."
