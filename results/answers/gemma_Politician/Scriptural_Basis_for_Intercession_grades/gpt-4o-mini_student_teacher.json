  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70 \n\nComment: The student provided a thorough response with several relevant Bible verses and additional principles that offer insights into the practice of interceding for others. However, the student should have included the verses specifically referenced by the teacher to fully address the concern and encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. The inclusion of those specific verses would have enhanced the student's answer and aligned it more closely with the Christian worldview from which the concern is approached."
