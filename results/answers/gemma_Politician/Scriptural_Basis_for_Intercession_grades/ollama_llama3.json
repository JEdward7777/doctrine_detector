  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good starting point by acknowledging the importance of exploring Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. However, it falls short in providing specific and relevant Bible verses that address this concern. While the provided verses are indeed related to prayer and intercession, they do not specifically speak to the encouragement of believers to explore Scripture for guidance.\n\nThe response does provide some additional principles, such as interceding with humility, faith, persistence, and unconditional love for others. These principles are indeed important for effective intercession, but they should be grounded in specific biblical teachings and examples.\n\nA higher grade would require a more explicit connection between the provided Bible verses and the concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession."
