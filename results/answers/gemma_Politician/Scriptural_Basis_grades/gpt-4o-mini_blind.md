Comments: The student correctly acknowledges their knowledge limitations, which is important to maintain honesty in academic discussions. However, in the context of a Christian-specific question, it would have been more appropriate to at least point the questioner towards resources where they could find the information they seek. Having a basic understanding of theological concepts, especially when dealing with religion-specific inquiries, can be beneficial in providing informed guidance.
