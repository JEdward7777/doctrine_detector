Key verses include 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26, which all highlight Jesus as the propitiation for our sins.

20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response is lacking in-depth theological analysis and fails to address the specific concern of connecting the concept of propitiation with relevant biblical references. A Christian worldview requires an understanding of biblical principles and their application, which this response does not demonstrate.
