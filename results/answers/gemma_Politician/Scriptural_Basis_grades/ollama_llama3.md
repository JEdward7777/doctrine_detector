Comment: The response acknowledges that the question requires connecting theological concepts with biblical references, but unfortunately, it does not attempt to do so. Instead, it simply states its limitations and inability to provide such responses. While honesty is important, this response does not demonstrate any effort to engage with the concern or provide meaningful connections between the theological concept and the biblical verses provided.
