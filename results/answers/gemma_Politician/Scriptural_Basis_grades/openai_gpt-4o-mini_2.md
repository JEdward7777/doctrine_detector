Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of connecting theological concepts with biblical references for deeper understanding, but falls short in providing any actual analysis or explanation. It's good that the response recognizes the need for this connection, but it lacks further elaboration which could enhance the understanding from a Christian worldview perspective.
