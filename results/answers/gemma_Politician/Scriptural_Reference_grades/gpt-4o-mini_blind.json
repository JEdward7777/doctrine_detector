  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComments:\nThe student provides a satisfactory overview of several biblical passages that discuss the concept of the \"world\" in relation to believers. However, the student places undue emphasis on the need for political correctness, which may dilute the message of the biblical passages. It is essential to prioritize doctrinal correctness and clarity of biblical teachings over societal concerns. Additionally, the student's interpretations lack depth and fail to emphasize key Christian doctrines such as the fallen nature of the world, the need for redemption through Christ, and the distinction between believers and the world. Encouragement to deepen theological understanding and focus on biblical truths would improve the response."
