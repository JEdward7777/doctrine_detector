  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant biblical passages addressing the concept of the \"world\" in relation to believers, but the response lacked depth and specificity to the concern raised about navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values. The student's answer did not directly address the concern or provide practical guidance on how believers should interact with the world's ungodly values. Additionally, the response could have been improved by aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
