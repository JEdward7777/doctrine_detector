## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Several biblical passages address the concept of the "world" in relation to believers. Here are a few that might be relevant, considering the need for political correctness:

**1. John 17:9:** "I pray for them [believers] that they be one as we are one, that the world may know that you [God] sent me."

This passage emphasizes the unity of believers as a witness to the world. It suggests a focus on loving and serving others, rather than on divisive ideologies.

**2. 1 John 2:13:** "We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another. Whoever does not love his brother or sister is not in the light."

This passage highlights the importance of love and compassion for all people, regardless of their background or beliefs. It promotes inclusivity and challenges discrimination.

**3. Romans 12:12:** "Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Share with those who are in need."

This passage encourages believers to extend kindness and support to those in the wider community. It emphasizes a holistic approach to engaging with the world, addressing physical and emotional needs.

**4. Matthew 5:43-48:** "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' But I say, love your neighbor as yourself for in him you have a fellow citizen."

This passage redefines the scope of love to include everyone, regardless of their status or beliefs. It promotes inclusion and challenges the common divide between "us" and "them."

**5. 2 Corinthians 5:19:** "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone away, the new has come."

This passage emphasizes the transformative power of faith in Christ, which transcends cultural and social boundaries. It suggests that believers are called to be agents of reconciliation and unity in the world.
