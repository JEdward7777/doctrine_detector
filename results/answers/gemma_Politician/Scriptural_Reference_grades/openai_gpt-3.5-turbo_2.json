  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The provided response offers a thoughtful exploration of relevant biblical passages and their implications for believers navigating a world with ungodly values. The integration of key passages like John 17:9, 1 John 2:13, Romans 12:12, Matthew 5:43-48, and 2 Corinthians 5:19 effectively addresses the concern raised, emphasizing love, unity, inclusivity, and transformation. However, the initial answer does not fully align with the passages discussed in the response, focusing on different verses. Despite this misalignment, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of how believers can engage with and influence the world from a Christian worldview perspective."
