  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of relevant biblical passages that address how believers should navigate life in a world characterized by ungodly values. The passages presented emphasize themes of unity, love, compassion, inclusivity, kindness, and transformation through faith in Christ. The integration of these passages with the concern raised demonstrates a strong understanding of how a Christian worldview can guide believers in interacting with a world that may hold ungodly values. Great job!"
