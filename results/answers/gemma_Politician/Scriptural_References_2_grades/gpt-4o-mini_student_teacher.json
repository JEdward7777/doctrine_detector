  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 20. \n\nWhile it is important to respect diverse beliefs and perspectives, the concern here is related to the specific aspect of reinforcing scriptural basis for beliefs regarding the day of judgment from a Christian worldview. The student's response did not address the question with relevant biblical passages, which is a key part of the concern provided. It is important for the student to engage with the question within the context of the given concern to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic."
