  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response does acknowledge the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and perspectives, it fails to directly address the concern of deepening understanding of scripture related to judgment. The provided answer does not seem to have any direct connection to the concern or the key passages mentioned. A stronger response would have explicitly connected the dots between the scriptural references and the concept of judgment, providing a clearer application of biblical principles."
