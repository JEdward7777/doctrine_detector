98.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 98

Comment: The response demonstrates a clear effort to deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforce beliefs by providing key passages from the Bible. The only reason for a slight deduction in grade is the initial disclaimer about not promoting religious agendas, which may limit the full exploration and application of Christian beliefs in this context.
