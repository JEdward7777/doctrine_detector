  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful interpretation of Matthew 23:27-28, highlighting the importance of integrity in one's faith. While it does not explicitly address the concern about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards, it indirectly touches on this theme by emphasizing the need for inner righteousness. The response shows an understanding of biblical concepts and is well-written, which earns it a high score. However, since it does not directly address the specified concern, it loses some points in terms of relevance to the given answer. Overall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of biblical principles and could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting its insights to the concern about pursuing genuine holiness."
