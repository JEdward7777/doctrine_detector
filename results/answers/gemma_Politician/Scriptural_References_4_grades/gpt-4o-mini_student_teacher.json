  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response does not engage with the content of the question or provide any analysis or insights related to the significance of birthright in Biblical teachings. By avoiding the discussion of potentially sensitive or controversial passages, the student missed the opportunity to deepen understanding in a Christian context. More effort should have been made to address the question's focus on scripture interpretation and relevance to contemporary Christian life."
