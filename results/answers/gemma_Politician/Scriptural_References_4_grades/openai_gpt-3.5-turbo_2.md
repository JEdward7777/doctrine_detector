## Question [Scriptural References 4](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_4.md)

Grade: 60

Comment: The response attempts to engage with the biblical passages in question by highlighting key themes such as birthright, holiness, and spiritual inheritance. However, the reluctance to address potentially sensitive or controversial aspects limits the depth of analysis and application to contemporary Christian life. Embracing a Christian worldview involves critically engaging with all aspects of scripture, even those that may challenge or provoke discussion.
