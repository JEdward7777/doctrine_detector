Comment: The response provided does not address the question at all and fails to engage with the topic within the context of a Christian worldview. In a theological discussion, it is crucial to examine and understand the shifts in biblical understanding regarding important concepts such as Hades, especially from a New Testament perspective. This answer lacks effort or substance in addressing the question.
