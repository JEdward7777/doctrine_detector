  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a lack of engagement with the question and the topic at hand. The concern specifically asked for interpretations of scriptural evidence related to Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology, which the student failed to address. In a Christian worldview, it is essential for students to engage with and provide interpretations based on scripture, which this response clearly does not do."
