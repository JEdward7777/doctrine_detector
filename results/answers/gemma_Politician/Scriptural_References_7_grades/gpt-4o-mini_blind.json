However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the doctrinal significance of exaltation within the Christian faith. The connection to modern political discourse, while well-intentioned, may detract from the central message of the passages. Additionally, a deeper exploration of Christ's exaltation through His sacrifice and resurrection could enhance the doctrinal depth of the response."
