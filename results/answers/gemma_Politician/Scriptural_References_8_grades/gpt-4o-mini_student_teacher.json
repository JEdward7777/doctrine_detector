  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough response by citing relevant biblical verses that support the concept of being blameless and offering practical guidance for Christians. The inclusion of examples from 1 Peter, Colossians, Ephesians, and James effectively illustrates key principles related to blamelessness. However, the student missed incorporating the additional references provided by the teacher, which would have enriched the answer further. Overall, a commendable effort in integrating scriptural support and practical advice for living a blameless life as a Christian."
