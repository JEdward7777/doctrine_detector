Grade: 40

Comment: While it is understandable that the student may not feel comfortable providing theological interpretations, in a Christian worldview context it is important to be able to reference specific Biblical passages. Encouraging consultation with religious authorities or scholars is appropriate, but a basic knowledge and reference to key passages like Genesis 17:1 would have been helpful in enhancing their answer.
