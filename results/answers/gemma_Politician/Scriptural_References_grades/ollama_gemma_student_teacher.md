70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of referencing biblical passages to deepen one's connection to Scripture and God's promises. However, the response lacks specific theological knowledge or interpretation of the referenced passage. By providing a clear reference to the book and verse containing the relevant passage, the student demonstrates a grasp of the factual information but could benefit from further elaboration or analysis of the theological significance of the term "Almighty" in relation to Abraham.
