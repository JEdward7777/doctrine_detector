  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThis response partially addresses the concern by providing a specific biblical reference (Genesis 17:1) related to God being referred to as \"Almighty\". However, it does not provide any interpretation or theological information regarding this passage, which is the main focus of the concern. Additionally, while it acknowledges that knowing biblical references can deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises, it does not demonstrate a deeper understanding or application of this concept.\n\nTo improve this response, I would like to see more analysis and reflection on what this reference means for our faith and how we can apply its insights to our daily lives."
