  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and comprehensive list of Bible verses emphasizing restoration, along with detailed illustrations of the themes present in these verses. The student's additional considerations also show a thoughtful reflection on the concept of restoration in one's faith journey. However, the student missed including references to Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6, which were specifically highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Integrating these verses would have further strengthened the student's response."
