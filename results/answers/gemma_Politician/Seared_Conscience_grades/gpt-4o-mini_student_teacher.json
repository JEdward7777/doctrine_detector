  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation of the concept of a seared conscience and its implications for a believer. They correctly identified the biblical meaning and offered insightful reflections on the awareness of sin, compassion, moral responsibility, and spiritual growth. However, the student's interpretation slightly deviates from the reference answer provided by the teacher, as they did not explicitly mention the insensitivity to sin aspect of a seared conscience. While their insights are valuable, aligning more closely with the reference answer would have strengthened their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
