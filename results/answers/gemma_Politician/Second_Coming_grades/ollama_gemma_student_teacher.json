  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of Jesus' return as the Messiah, but lacks specific elaboration on the implications for believers. It could benefit from further elaboration on how Jesus' return fulfills God's promises and offers hope. However, it avoids taking a controversial or contentious position, which aligns with the Christian specific worldview and concern expressed."
