Comment: While the response correctly reflects a focus on factual information and avoiding subjective interpretations, it fails to address the specific question asked about why the Pharisees were concerned about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles. The response should have at least attempted to provide a doctrinally sound explanation within the context of Christian beliefs.
