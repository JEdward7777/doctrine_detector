  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 60/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a factual understanding of the Pharisees' concern about preserving religious purity, but it lacks nuance and fails to address the specific concern related to the separation of the Jewish people from Gentiles in a diverse cultural context. The response could benefit from further elaboration and engagement with the provided concern."
