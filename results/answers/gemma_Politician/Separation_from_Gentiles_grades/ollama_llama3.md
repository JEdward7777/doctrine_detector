## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 85.

The response provides a clear and factual explanation of the Pharisees' concern about separating themselves from Gentiles, which is in line with the given answer. The language used is objective and neutral, without expressing any subjective opinions or biases.

However, I deduct a few points because the response does not explicitly address the concern that the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context reflects their attempt to maintain religious purity and adherence to Jewish laws and traditions. While this connection can be inferred from the provided information, it would have been strengthened by explicit mention.

Overall, the response effectively conveys factual information about the Pharisees' concern without expressing subjective opinions or biases, making it a strong example of providing accurate information within its stated limitations.
