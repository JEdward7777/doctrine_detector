The emphasis on core beliefs, inclusivity, service, personal growth, dialogue, social justice, and modeling Christian values is commendable. However, the answer could have been strengthened by including more specific references to Scripture to support each point and by highlighting the primacy of Christ as the foundation for all Christian ministry. Additionally, a clearer connection to the overarching purpose of glorifying God in all actions could have enhanced the depth of the response."
