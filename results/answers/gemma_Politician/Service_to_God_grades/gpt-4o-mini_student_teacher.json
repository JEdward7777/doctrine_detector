  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive list of actionable ways for Christians to engage in ministry, incorporating aspects of core beliefs, inclusivity, service, personal growth, dialogue, social justice, and modeling Christian values. However, the student's answer lacks specificity and direct alignment with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which highlights teaching about God, caring for the sick, providing food for the poor, and fulfilling specific ministry roles. While the student's suggestions are valuable and aligned with a Christian worldview, they could have been more directly connected to the reference answer to receive a higher grade."
