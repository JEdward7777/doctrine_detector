Comment: While it is important to be sensitive to different beliefs and perspectives, as a Christian, it is crucial to prioritize sharing the biblical perspective on the rainbow as a sign of God's covenant with humanity in Genesis. This response lacks doctrinal correctness and misses the opportunity to explain the significance of the rainbow in a Christian worldview.
