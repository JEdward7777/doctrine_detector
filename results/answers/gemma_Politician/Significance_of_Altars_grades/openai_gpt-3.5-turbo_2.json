It aligns well with the concern provided, demonstrating understanding of how this aspect of worship is significant for Christians. The only small deduction is due to the initial disclaimer about discussing potentially controversial or sensitive topics, which might imply a lack of confidence in addressing matters related to religious beliefs."
