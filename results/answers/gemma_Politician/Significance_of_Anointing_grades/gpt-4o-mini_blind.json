  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of the significance of anointing in the Old Testament, touching on symbolic, practical, ritual, cultural, and divine mandate aspects. However, the answer lacks specific references to key Old Testament passages that explicitly detail the process and significance of anointing for priests, kings, and prophets. The section on \"Considerations for Political Correctness\" is somewhat out of place in discussing the theological significance of anointing and could be omitted to focus more on the doctrinal aspects of the topic. Further integration of biblical references and theological insights would strengthen the response."
