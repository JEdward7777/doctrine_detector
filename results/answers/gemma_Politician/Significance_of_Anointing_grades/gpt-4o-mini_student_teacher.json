  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the significance of anointing in the Old Testament, touching on various aspects such as symbolic representation, practical application, ritual purity, cultural significance, and divine mandate. They have shown a good understanding of the topic and its importance in biblical leadership roles. However, there is room for improvement by emphasizing more on the theological significance of anointing in relation to divine empowerment for service to God, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, integrating more scripture references could strengthen the Biblical foundation of the explanation."
