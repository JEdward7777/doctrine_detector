  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 60/100.\n\nWhile the answer touches on some relevant points, it lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective. The significance of 'Shaddai' being translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations goes beyond avoiding theological confusion and cultural sensitivity. It is crucial because 'Shaddai' is one of the names of God in the Bible, specifically referring to God's omnipotence and sufficiency. Therefore, the translation impacts the understanding of God's attributes and character, which is fundamental to Christian doctrine.\n\nTo improve the grade, the student should focus more on the doctrinal implications of translating 'Shaddai' as a title and emphasize its theological significance in shaping the reader's understanding of God in Christian Scriptures."
