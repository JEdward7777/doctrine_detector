## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

## Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
The translation of 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations is significant because it avoids potentially creating theological or cultural misunderstandings.

* **Avoids Theological Confusion:** Translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name avoids associating it with the idea of divine nomenclature, which may confuse some readers who are unfamiliar with Jewish theological concepts.


* **Cultural Sensitivity:** In certain cultures, the use of titles rather than names is considered respectful and appropriate. By translating 'Shaddai' as a title, translators demonstrate sensitivity to these cultural norms and avoid potentially offending readers from such backgrounds.


* **Inclusive Representation:** Translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name promotes inclusivity by recognizing that divine attributes can be expressed in various ways without compromising theological precision.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this answer as 60/100.

While the answer touches on some relevant points, it lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective. The significance of 'Shaddai' being translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations goes beyond avoiding theological confusion and cultural sensitivity. It is crucial because 'Shaddai' is one of the names of God in the Bible, specifically referring to God's omnipotence and sufficiency. Therefore, the translation impacts the understanding of God's attributes and character, which is fundamental to Christian doctrine.

To improve the grade, the student should focus more on the doctrinal implications of translating 'Shaddai' as a title and emphasize its theological significance in shaping the reader's understanding of God in Christian Scriptures.
