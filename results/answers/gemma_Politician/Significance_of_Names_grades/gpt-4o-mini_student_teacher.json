  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that addresses theological confusion, cultural sensitivity, and inclusive representation regarding the translation of 'Shaddai' as a title. However, the student did not directly connect the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title to deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith, as specified in the concern. The student's answer lacks a direct reference to the attributes of God emphasized by translating 'Shaddai' as a title versus a name in relation to deepening the understanding of God's character within the Christian faith."
