## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

## Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
The translation of 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations is significant because it avoids potentially creating theological or cultural misunderstandings.

* **Avoids Theological Confusion:** Translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name avoids associating it with the idea of divine nomenclature, which may confuse some readers who are unfamiliar with Jewish theological concepts.


* **Cultural Sensitivity:** In certain cultures, the use of titles rather than names is considered respectful and appropriate. By translating 'Shaddai' as a title, translators demonstrate sensitivity to these cultural norms and avoid potentially offending readers from such backgrounds.


* **Inclusive Representation:** Translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name promotes inclusivity by recognizing that divine attributes can be expressed in various ways without compromising theological precision.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that addresses theological confusion, cultural sensitivity, and inclusive representation regarding the translation of 'Shaddai' as a title. However, the student did not directly connect the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title to deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith, as specified in the concern. The student's answer lacks a direct reference to the attributes of God emphasized by translating 'Shaddai' as a title versus a name in relation to deepening the understanding of God's character within the Christian faith.
