  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. The student provides well-reasoned arguments related to theological clarity, cultural sensitivity, and inclusivity. The response also aligns well with the teacher's reference answer by highlighting the distinction between emphasizing God's attributes and expressing a personal relationship with God."
