20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: While it is commendable that the student acknowledges their limitations in providing interpretations of religious events, they fail to engage with the question in the context of Christian theology. A better response would have briefly explained the significance of the Day of Pentecost as the event where the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, empowering them to spread the message of Jesus Christ. This answer, while respectful, lacks the doctrinal perspective necessary for a higher grade.
