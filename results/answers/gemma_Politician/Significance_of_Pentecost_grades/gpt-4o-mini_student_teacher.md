Comment: While it is important to acknowledge the limitations of providing subjective interpretations, as a student responding to a question about the significance of the Day of Pentecost in the New Testament, it is essential to engage with the specific theological aspect highlighted in the concern, which is the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. The student should have made an effort to at least mention the empowering aspect of believers through the Holy Spirit as indicated in the reference answer.
