Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the significance of the Day of Pentecost in Christian belief, focusing on the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for ministry and fulfilling Jesus' promise. It demonstrates an understanding of the spiritual significance of the event within a Christian worldview. The only point deducted is for not directly addressing the concern raised about the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers, as the response focuses more on the historical significance of Pentecost rather than delving into the practical and personal impact of the Holy Spirit on individual believers.
