Grade: 20

Comment: While the student's response demonstrates an attitude of respect for diverse beliefs and perspectives, it falls short in addressing the specific question from a Christian perspective. In a Christian worldview, unleavened bread symbolizes purity, sincerity, and a life free from sin, particularly in the context of the Passover and the Last Supper. The response could have briefly touched upon these points without delving into controversial interpretations.
