  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While it is commendable to strive for factual and non-biased information, an LLM response should also demonstrate an understanding of the question asked. In this case, the question specifically inquired about the title 'tetrarch' in relation to governance during the time of Jesus. Providing a response that refuses to engage in historical or political analysis does not fully address the prompt. To improve the grade, the student could have acknowledged the title 'tetrarch' without delving into speculation or bias, focusing on the known historical facts surrounding the term."
