  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While it is important to remain neutral in certain contexts, in this case, it is necessary to engage with the question from a Christian worldview in order to provide an appropriate response. In discussing the role of signs and miracles in proving the truth of God's message, a more doctrinally specific and informed answer is needed. This response does not address the question in the context it was asked, which is why a lower grade is given."
