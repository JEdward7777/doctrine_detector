## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: While it is important to remain neutral in certain contexts, in this case, it is necessary to engage with the question from a Christian worldview in order to provide an appropriate response. In discussing the role of signs and miracles in proving the truth of God's message, a more doctrinally specific and informed answer is needed. This response does not address the question in the context it was asked, which is why a lower grade is given.
