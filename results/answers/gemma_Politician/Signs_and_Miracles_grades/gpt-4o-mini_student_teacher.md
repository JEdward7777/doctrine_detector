Grade: 40

Comment: While it is important to approach religious topics with sensitivity and respect for different beliefs, in this context, it is crucial to consider the specific Christian worldview being presented. The teacher's answer emphasizes the role of signs and miracles in validating God's message, which aligns with Christian teachings. The student's response, although respectful in tone, lacks engagement with the core Christian perspective on the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. A more thorough consideration of the intersection between faith and miraculous events within the Christian framework would have strengthened the answer.
