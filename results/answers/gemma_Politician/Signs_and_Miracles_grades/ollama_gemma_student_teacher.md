**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a factual and neutral approach by avoiding subjective interpretations and claims regarding religious beliefs. However, it lacks a deeper engagement with the specific concern of examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. The response could benefit from providing more explicit analysis of how signs and miracles contribute to the overall message and authority of God's revelation through Jesus and the apostles.
