## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The response provides a clear and concise statement about the role of signs and miracles in God's revelation, which aligns with the concern about examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. However, the tone is more descriptive than analytical or theological, and does not engage deeply with the biblical concepts involved. A higher grade would require a more nuanced exploration of the interplay between faith, signs, and God's revelation, as well as a deeper engagement with Scripture to support the claims made.
