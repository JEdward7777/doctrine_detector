Comment: The response acknowledges the significance of signs and miracles as validations of God's power and authority in delivering His message through Jesus and the apostles. It effectively relates these manifestations to God's revelation, which is essential in understanding the Christian worldview. However, the response could have delved deeper into the faith aspect and emphasized the role of faith in recognizing and interpreting these signs and miracles as divine interventions.
