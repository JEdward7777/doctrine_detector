  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks the depth needed to address the concern raised about understanding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God. While the student acknowledges they cannot provide religious or theological interpretations, their response could have at least acknowledged the basic Christian belief that Jesus, as the Son of God, is considered fully divine and in eternal relationship with God the Father. It would have been beneficial for the student to briefly mention this aspect to show some understanding of the topic, even without delving into detailed interpretations."
