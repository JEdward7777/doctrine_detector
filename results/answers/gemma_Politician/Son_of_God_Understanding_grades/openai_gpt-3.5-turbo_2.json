  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term 'Son of God' within a Christian worldview, acknowledging Jesus' divinity and eternal relationship with God. However, the initial statement indicates an unwillingness to engage with religious or theological interpretations, which limits the depth of the response in addressing the concern. Thus, while the content is correct, the overall grade is lower due to the lack of willingness to delve into theological aspects."
