  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a correct interpretation of the term 'Son of God' within a Christian worldview, acknowledging the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God. However, the initial disclaimer given by the responder regarding religious or theological interpretations indicates a reluctance to engage in discussions related to Christian beliefs. This limits the depth and strength of the response from a Christian perspective."
