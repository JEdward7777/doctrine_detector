  "grade_comment": "The response accurately distinguishes between the title \"Son of God\" as it refers to Jesus and the term \"sons of God\" used for believers. It correctly explains that \"Son of God\" uniquely identifies Jesus as the literal Son of God, while \"sons of God\" refers to believers being adopted into God's family through their relationship with Him. Doctrinally, this distinction is important in Christian theology.\n\nGrade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological distinction between the title \"Son of God\" as applied to Jesus Christ and the term \"sons of God\" used for believers. Well done!"
