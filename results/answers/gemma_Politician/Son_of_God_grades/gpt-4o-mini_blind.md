The title "Son of God" specifically refers to Jesus Christ, who is believed by Christians to be the literal son of God. The term "sons of God" is a broader concept that describes believers in Christ as being adopted into the family of God. It emphasizes their spiritual relationship with God rather than their biological lineage.</end_of_turn>

The response accurately distinguishes between the title "Son of God" as it refers to Jesus and the term "sons of God" used for believers. It correctly explains that "Son of God" uniquely identifies Jesus as the literal Son of God, while "sons of God" refers to believers being adopted into God's family through their relationship with Him. Doctrinally, this distinction is important in Christian theology.
