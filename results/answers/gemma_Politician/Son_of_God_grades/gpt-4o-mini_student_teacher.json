  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student accurately identifies the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" as it refers to Jesus and the term \"sons of God\" used for believers. This clear explanation effectively helps to avoid confusion in theological discussions. The only slight improvement would have been to explicitly mention that Jesus is the only Son of God, as clarified in the reference answer. Overall, a strong answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
