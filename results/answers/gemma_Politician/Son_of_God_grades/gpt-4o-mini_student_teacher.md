## [Answer](../Son_of_God.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
The title "Son of God" specifically refers to Jesus Christ, who is believed by Christians to be the literal son of God. The term "sons of God" is a broader concept that describes believers in Christ as being adopted into the family of God. It emphasizes their spiritual relationship with God rather than their biological lineage.</end_of_turn>
