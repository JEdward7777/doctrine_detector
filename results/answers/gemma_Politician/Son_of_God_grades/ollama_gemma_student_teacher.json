  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately explains the distinction between the two terms from a Christian perspective. It clearly articulates that \"Son of God\" refers specifically to Jesus Christ as the literal son of God, while \"sons of God\" describes believers as adopted into the family of God. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concepts and demonstrates clarity in addressing the concern for avoiding confusion in theological discussions."
