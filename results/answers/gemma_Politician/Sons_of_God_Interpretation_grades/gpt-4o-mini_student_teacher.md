Comment: While it is commendable that the student acknowledges their limitations in providing interpretations of religious texts, a basic understanding or summary of the different interpretations of the term 'sons of God' would have been beneficial for a more comprehensive response. Encouraging the student to at least mention some general interpretations or explanations within a Christian worldview would have improved their grade.
