  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the concern regarding biblical interpretation. However, it lacks specific examples or elaboration on the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" within Genesis 6. Including more detailed information and supporting arguments would have elevated the quality of the response. Nonetheless, it provides a concise acknowledgment of the importance of consulting reliable religious sources for accurate interpretations."
