## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response acknowledges that interpretations can vary depending on different perspectives, which is in line with the concern about understanding biblical interpretation. However, it does not provide any specific insights or analysis of the term "sons of God" itself. The response mainly focuses on the limitations of the model's capabilities and defers to external authorities for reliable interpretations.

A higher grade would require more specific and analytical discussion of the various interpretations, as well as a deeper exploration of how biblical interpretation can help grasp the meaning of scripture passages.
