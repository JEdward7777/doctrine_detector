Grade: 20

Comment: While the response appropriately defers to religious scholars for interpretations of religious texts, it fails to engage with the underlying concern regarding biblical interpretation and its importance in understanding the meaning of scripture passages. A more thorough examination of the significance of biblical interpretation within a Christian worldview would have improved the response.
