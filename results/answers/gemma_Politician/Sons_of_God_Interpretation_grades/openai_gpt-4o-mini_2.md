Grade: 50

Comment: While the response acknowledges the different interpretations of the term 'sons of God,' it lacks depth in connecting this interpretation to the broader understanding of biblical interpretation. It is important to consider how interpretations of specific biblical passages contribute to our overall understanding of scripture and theological principles. Encouraging further exploration and explanation of how biblical interpretation enhances the comprehension of scripture would have improved the response.
