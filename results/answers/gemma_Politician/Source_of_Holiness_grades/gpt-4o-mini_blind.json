However, it falls short in accuracy by not mentioning the foundational aspect of how believers become saints according to the Christian doctrine, which is through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross and the belief in Him as Lord and Savior. Emphasizing this crucial aspect would have significantly improved the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
