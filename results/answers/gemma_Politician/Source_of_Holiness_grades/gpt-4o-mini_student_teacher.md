## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
In the Christian faith, believers become saints through a process of spiritual growth, transformation, and faithfulness. It is not through any specific actions or behaviors that they become saints, but rather through their unwavering commitment to following Christ's teachings and living a life that reflects his love and compassion.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The student's answer correctly emphasizes the importance of faith in the process of believers becoming saints, but it falls short in directly attributing holiness to the saving work of Jesus Christ. Encouraging the student to explicitly mention Jesus as the source of holiness would strengthen their answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
