## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively clarifies the source of holiness as being rooted in faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, which aligns with Christian doctrine. The emphasis on faith in Jesus as the one who makes believers holy reinforces a central tenet of the Christian faith. However, the response could have further emphasized the role of faith over actions in becoming saints to fully address the concern.
