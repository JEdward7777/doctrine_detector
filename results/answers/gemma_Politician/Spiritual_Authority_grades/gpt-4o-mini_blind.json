They have highlighted key differences in the source, purpose, scope of authority, accountability, and motivation of each type of authority. The answer is well-structured and grounded in Biblical principles. The student could improve the answer by further emphasizing the importance of submitting to both spiritual and earthly authorities within their respective domains as instructed in Romans 13:1-7 and Hebrews 13:17."
