  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student's answer provides a thorough comparison between spiritual and earthly authorities based on Biblical principles, it lacks a direct reference to a specific Bible verse like the teacher's answer does. Incorporating direct Biblical references adds strength and authority to the argument in a Christian worldview context. Additionally, the student's response could have delved deeper into the impact and implications of recognizing the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority in a Christian's life."
