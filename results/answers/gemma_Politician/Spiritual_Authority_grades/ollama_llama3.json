  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response touches on the distinction between spiritual authorities and earthly authorities, it lacks depth and clarity in its explanation. The mention of Ephesians 6:12 as a reference to spiritual authorities is a good starting point, but the connection between these authorities and their implications for a Christian's life is not fully explored.\n\nThe concern was recognizing the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority and their implications in a Christian's life, but this response only scratches the surface of what that means. A more comprehensive explanation of how Christians should navigate these two types of authority would be necessary to fully address the concern.\n\nComment: This response has some good starting points, but it could be improved by providing more detail and clarity on the differences between spiritual and earthly authorities and their implications for a Christian's life."
