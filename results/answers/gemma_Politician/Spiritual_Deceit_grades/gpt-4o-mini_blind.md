Comment: The student correctly acknowledges the absence of information regarding demons or their role in idolatry in the provided text. However, from a Christian worldview, it would have been beneficial for the student to briefly mention that, in Christian belief, demons are spiritual beings who seek to deceive and lead people away from the worship of the true God. This additional insight would have demonstrated an understanding of the Christian perspective on the role of demons in deception and idolatry.
