However, from a Christian perspective, the teacher's answer emphasizes the role of demons in deceiving people into idolatry, highlighting the importance of recognizing and resisting spiritual deception. The student could have presented a brief response aligning with this Christian worldview, even if it was not explicitly provided in the initial text."
