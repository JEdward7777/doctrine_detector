The concern of remaining vigilant against spiritual deceit is effectively addressed by emphasizing the truth of God's sovereignty. The only point deducted is due to the mention of \"Yahweh\" not being explicitly present in the original question, which could have been phrased more generally as \"God\" to better align with the given context."
