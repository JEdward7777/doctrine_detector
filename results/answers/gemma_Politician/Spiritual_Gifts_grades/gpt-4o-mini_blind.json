  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the answer attempts to address various aspects of the phrase \"spiritual gifts,\" it falls short in presenting a Christian-specific worldview. The focus on cultural sensitivity, inclusive language, scientific and medical considerations, and recommendations for politically correct language detracts from the central biblical teaching on spiritual gifts. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to highlight the biblical foundation and significance of spiritual gifts within the Christian faith. More emphasis on scriptural references, theological understanding, and the role of spiritual gifts in the church would greatly enhance the grade."
