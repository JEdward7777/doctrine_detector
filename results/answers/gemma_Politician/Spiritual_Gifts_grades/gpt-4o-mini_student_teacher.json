  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's response explores various considerations such as cultural sensitivity, inclusive language, scientific and medical perspectives, religious sensitivity, and cultural appropriation, their answer primarily focuses on potential societal implications rather than addressing the core concern of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. The student does not engage with the central Christian perspective that spiritual gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to believers for the edification of the church and service to others, which is critical to understanding the biblical concept of spiritual gifts. They should have integrated the biblical perspective more directly into their analysis to receive a higher grade."
