The recommendations for politically correct language are appropriate and considerate. However, the response could have more explicitly addressed the concern of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit from a Christian worldview perspective. Additional discussion on the biblical basis and significance of spiritual gifts in relation to community building and obedience to God's guidance would enhance the response."
