However, it focuses more on potential concerns and politically correct language rather than directly addressing the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. It would be beneficial to further emphasize the significance of spiritual gifts in the context of community building and obedience to the Holy Spirit within a Christian worldview."
