  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response addresses various considerations related to the use of the term \"spiritual gifts\" in a culturally sensitive and inclusive manner, it falls short in acknowledging the underlying Christian belief that these gifts are given by the Holy Spirit for a specific purpose within the context of the church. It is important to balance cultural sensitivity with the foundational Christian understanding of spiritual gifts as described in the Bible, while also being mindful of different interpretations within Christian denominations. A stronger connection to the biblical perspective and the significance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit would enhance the overall grade of the response."
