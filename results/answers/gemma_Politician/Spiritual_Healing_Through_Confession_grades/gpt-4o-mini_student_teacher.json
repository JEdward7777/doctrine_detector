  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 75.\nWhile the student provided a thorough and well-explained response to how confessing sins to one another contributes to spiritual healing, they expanded on various aspects beyond what was explicitly mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. While the student's response touched upon important points like exposing root causes, fostering genuine relationships, promoting humility, and facilitating transformation, the teacher's reference answer primarily highlights accountability, support, and encouragement among believers. The student's additional insights are valuable and align with a Christian worldview, but focusing more on the core points mentioned in the reference answer could have potentially resulted in a higher grade."
