Comment: The response partially addresses the concern by providing a biblical interpretation of baptism, but it does not delve deeper into the spiritual implications of physical practices in modern Christianity as specified. While it's a good start, it would be beneficial to explore more nuances and connections between faith in Jesus Christ and the practice of baptism.
