However, from a Christian worldview, understanding the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early church context and the broader theme of persecution faced by believers is crucial. The student's answer does not directly engage with the Christian perspective on the cost of discipleship and faithfulness in the face of persecution as requested in the concern. Encouraging the student to acknowledge the historical context and significance of Stephen's stoning within the framework of early Christian challenges would have enhanced their response."
