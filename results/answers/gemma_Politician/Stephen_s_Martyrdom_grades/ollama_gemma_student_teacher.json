While they acknowledge the significance of Stephen's martyrdom, they also express concern over the normalization of harmful actions. This reflects a commendable sensitivity to the suffering of victims and the importance of fostering a just and inclusive society. However, the response could benefit from a more direct engagement with the specific concern about the cost of discipleship and faithfulness in the face of persecution."
