This aligns well with the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of remaining faithful despite challenges. The response could further strengthen its Christian worldview by explicitly linking Stephen's sacrifice to the example set by Jesus Christ and the broader theme of persecution in the Bible."
