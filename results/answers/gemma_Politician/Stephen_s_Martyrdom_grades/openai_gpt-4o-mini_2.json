  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights the significance of Stephen's stoning as the first martyrdom in the early Christian church, emphasizing the theme of faithfulness in the face of persecution. It aligns well with Christian teachings on the cost of discipleship and the importance of standing firm in one's faith, despite the threat of death. The only minor deduction is that it could have further elaborated on the theological and spiritual implications of Stephen's martyrdom for believers today."
