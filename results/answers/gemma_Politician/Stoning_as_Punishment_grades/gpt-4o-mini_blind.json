However, in a Christian worldview, it is important to address difficult passages in the Bible with knowledge of the historical and cultural context, as well as an understanding of God's justice and mercy. While it is important to acknowledge the challenging nature of certain biblical practices, it is also crucial to explore how they may reflect God's character and overarching plan for humanity. The answer could have delved into how stoning for adultery was a cultural practice in ancient times and how God's justice and mercy are ultimately shown through His willingness to forgive and offer redemption through Christ."
