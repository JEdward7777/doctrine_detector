## Question [Stoning as Punishment](../../../questions/Stoning_as_Punishment.md)

Understanding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments.

Comment: The student's answer correctly acknowledges the controversial and challenging nature of stoning as a punishment for adultery. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of balancing God's justice and mercy in His commandments, which is essential for a comprehensive Christian worldview perspective on the topic. The response could have benefited from incorporating biblical references like the example of Jesus and the woman caught in adultery to demonstrate how God's justice and mercy can coexist even in difficult situations.
