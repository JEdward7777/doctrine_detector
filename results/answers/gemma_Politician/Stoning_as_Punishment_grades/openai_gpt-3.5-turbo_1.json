  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response highlights the tension between God's justice and mercy in His commandments by mentioning the Old Testament law regarding stoning for adultery and contrasting it with Jesus's demonstration of mercy in the New Testament. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of this theological concept within a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of explicit application or resolution of how this understanding informs the interpretation of stoning as a punishment for adultery today."
