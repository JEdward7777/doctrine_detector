## Question [Stoning as Punishment](../../../questions/Stoning_as_Punishment.md)
What does the Bible say about the practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery, and how does this reflect God's justice and mercy?

## Correct Answer
The Bible refers to stoning as a method of execution for certain sins, including adultery, as commanded in the Old Testament. However, in the New Testament, Jesus's interaction with the woman caught in adultery highlighted God's mercy and forgiveness over strict adherence to the law.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments.

Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a solid Christian worldview perspective by acknowledging the historical context of stoning in the Old Testament while also highlighting Jesus's emphasis on mercy and forgiveness in the New Testament. It effectively addresses the concern by recognizing the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. The slight deduction is due to not explicitly addressing how the Old Testament laws should be understood in light of Jesus's teachings in the New Testament.
