Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the shift from strict legal punishment to mercy and forgiveness emphasized by Jesus in the New Testament. It demonstrates an understanding of the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments while also acknowledging the cultural and ethical differences between ancient practices and contemporary standards. However, the response could have been more explicit in affirming the importance of upholding human rights and ethical principles in the interpretation of biblical teachings.
