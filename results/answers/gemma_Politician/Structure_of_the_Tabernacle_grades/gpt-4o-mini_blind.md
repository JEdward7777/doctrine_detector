Comment: While it is important to respect diverse beliefs and perspectives, in the context of answering a question about the tabernacle, it is necessary to provide appropriate information based on the Christian worldview. This response lacked factual content related to the question asked. Would have been better to provide a brief explanation of the two main sections of the tabernacle and what was located in each from a neutral standpoint.
