Grade: 20

Comment: The response missed the opportunity to integrate a Christian worldview perspective by addressing the significance of the components of the tabernacle in worship. While neutrality and respect for diverse beliefs are important, in this context, a more targeted response highlighting the spiritual and symbolic meanings of the Holy Place and Most Holy Place would have been more appropriate.
