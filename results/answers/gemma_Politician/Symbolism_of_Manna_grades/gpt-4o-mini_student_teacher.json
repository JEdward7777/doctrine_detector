  "grade": 25.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 25/100. \n\nWhile it is understandable that the student may not have in-depth knowledge of religious or symbolic interpretations from a Christian worldview, the concern given in this scenario specifically addresses recognizing God's ongoing provision in the lives of believers. In this context, the student could have simply paraphrased the teacher's reference answer about manna symbolizing God's provision for the Israelites without delving into deep religious interpretations. By acknowledging the basic concept without adding personal bias or deep interpretation, the student could have demonstrated an understanding of the theme of God's provision in a Christian worldview."
