## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response fails to engage with the question within a Christian worldview. Exploring the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in relation to His followers is essential in understanding Christian doctrine. By avoiding theological interpretations, the student missed an opportunity to provide a meaningful response based on Christian beliefs.
