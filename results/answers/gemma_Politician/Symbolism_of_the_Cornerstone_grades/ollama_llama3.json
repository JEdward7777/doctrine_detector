  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise explanation of the cornerstone metaphor in relation to Jesus, highlighting his role as both source of strength and reference point for believers' lives and faith. This accurately reflects the concern about understanding the relationship between Christ's teachings and example and how they can guide believers' lives.\n\nHowever, the grade is not higher because the response does not explicitly address the practical application or implications of this understanding. While it identifies the importance of aligning one's life with Christ's teachings and example, it does not provide specific examples or ways in which this can be achieved."
