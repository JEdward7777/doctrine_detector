Grade: 75

Comment: The response provided a good understanding of the cornerstone metaphor in a Christian context. However, it failed to address the concern provided, which is understanding this relationship to align one's life with Christ's teachings. A Christian worldview would emphasize the importance of aligning one's life with Christ, which was not reflected in the response.
