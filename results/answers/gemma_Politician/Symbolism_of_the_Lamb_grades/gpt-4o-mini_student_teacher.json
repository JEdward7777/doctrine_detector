  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 50. \n\nComment: The student's answer does not engage with the Christian-specific context and symbolism related to the use of a lamb for sacrifices in the Bible and the concept of atonement. While the student's response is respectful in avoiding overt religious discussion, it misses the opportunity to explore the significance of the lamb in Christian theology. The student could have acknowledged the symbolism of the lamb as representing innocence and purity, while also linking it to the sacrificial aspect and atonement in Christianity."
