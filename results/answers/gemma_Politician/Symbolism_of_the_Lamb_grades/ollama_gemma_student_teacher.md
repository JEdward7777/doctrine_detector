## Question [Symbolism of the Lamb](../../../questions/Symbolism_of_the_Lamb.md)
What is the significance of using a lamb for sacrifices in the Bible, and how does this relate to the concept of atonement?

## Correct Answer
A lamb symbolizes innocence and purity, and its use in sacrifices relates to atonement as it represents the innocent being sacrificed to cover the sins of the guilty.

## Stated Concern
This question invites Christians to delve deeper into the symbolism of the lamb and its importance in the understanding of atonement and redemption through Christ.
