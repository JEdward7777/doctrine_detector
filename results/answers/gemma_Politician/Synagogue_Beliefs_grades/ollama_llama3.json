This approach does not fully capture the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship as indicated by the term \"synagogue\".\n\nTo better address the concern, a more accurate response might acknowledge the traditional meaning of the term while still highlighting the importance of community and gathering in worship. For example: \"While the term 'synagogue' typically refers to a physical building used for Jewish worship, it also underscores the significance of communal worship and the importance of believers coming together to glorify God.\""
