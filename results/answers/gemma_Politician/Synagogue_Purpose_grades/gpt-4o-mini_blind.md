Comment: While it is important to acknowledge limitations in knowledge, a more balanced approach would have been to provide general information on the role of synagogues in ancient Jewish worship that is consistent with historical record or biblical teachings. This response shows an awareness of the limits of one's knowledge, but could have included some basic information on the topic from a Christian worldview perspective.
