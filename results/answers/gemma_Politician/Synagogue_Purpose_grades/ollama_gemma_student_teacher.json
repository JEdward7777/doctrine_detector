  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the role of synagogues in ancient Jewish worship practices. However, it lacks specific examples or elaboration on the importance of synagogues for Jews living far from the temple. The response could benefit from further research and a more detailed explanation of the religious significance of these structures."
