  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the historical and religious importance of synagogues in Jewish worship.

The deductive score is because the initial response failed to provide information due to a lack of historical knowledge, which could have been overcome through research or consultation."
