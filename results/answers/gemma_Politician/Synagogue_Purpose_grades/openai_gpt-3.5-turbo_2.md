Grade: 90

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the historical and religious importance of synagogues in Jewish worship. The concern was addressed effectively, providing relevant information on the functions of synagogues for Jews living far from the temple in Jerusalem. The deductive score is because the initial response failed to provide information due to a lack of historical knowledge, which could have been overcome through research or consultation.
