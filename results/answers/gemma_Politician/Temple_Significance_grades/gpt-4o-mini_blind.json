In a Christian worldview, it is essential to approach the topic with respect and understanding of the biblical significance of the temple in worshiping God and reflecting His presence among His people. The answer could have at least mentioned that the temple served as a place for worship, sacrifices, and a symbol of God's dwelling with His people."
