The concern is adequately addressed with a clear and concise explanation, aligning well with a Christian worldview perspective. The deductive points are minor, but the response could have enriched the explanation by highlighting the theological significance of the temple in pointing towards the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ in Christian belief."
