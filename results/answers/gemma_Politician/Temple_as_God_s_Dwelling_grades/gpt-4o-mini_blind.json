  "grade_comment": "This answer provides a sound overview of how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is expressed in both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively outlines the differences between the physical representation in the Old Testament and the spiritual metaphorical interpretation in the New Testament. However, the inclusion of considerations for political correctness at the end detracts from the doctrinal focus of the question, which should center on understanding the biblical perspective on the temple as God's dwelling place. \n\nGrade: 85\n\nComment: The answer effectively covers the Old and New Testament perspectives on the temple as God's dwelling, but should emphasize doctrinal correctness over considerations for political correctness."
