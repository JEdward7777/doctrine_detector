  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is expressed in both the Old and New Testaments, including scriptural references. However, the concern was exploring the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, and the answer did not delve deeply into the significance of this theological truth. The student also brought up considerations for political correctness, which, while valid in a broader context, is not directly relevant to the theological discussion at hand. Overall, a solid response but could benefit from a more focused theological analysis."
