It appropriately incorporates relevant biblical references and presents the transition from the physical temple in the Old Testament to the spiritual temple in the New Testament. The considerations for political correctness show awareness of different perspectives. However, a deeper analysis connecting how God's presence among His people impacts Christian beliefs and practices could enhance the overall response."
