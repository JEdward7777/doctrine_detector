  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the theological implications of God dwelling among His people in both the Old and New Testaments. It provides a clear explanation of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling place, both physically and spiritually. The reference to believers as the 'temple of the Holy Spirit' in the New Testament is apt. The consideration for political correctness is also addressed sensitively, recognizing the importance of inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful response."
