Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided completely avoids addressing the question regarding Jesus' response to temptations presented by Satan. In a Christian worldview context, it is essential to engage with the question directly by discussing the biblical account of Jesus' response to temptation. The student should have shown an understanding of Jesus' responses in the Bible to earn a higher grade.
