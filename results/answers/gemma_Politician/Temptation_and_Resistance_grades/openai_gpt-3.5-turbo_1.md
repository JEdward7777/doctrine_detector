Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate interpretation of Jesus' resistance to temptation, highlighting his obedience to God. It effectively addresses the concern by showing how Jesus' example serves as a model for Christians in facing spiritual battles against evil. The only deduction is due to a lack of explicit reference to the significance of this event from a broader Christian worldview perspective.
