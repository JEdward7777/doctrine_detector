  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the concept of \"tempting God\" from a biblical perspective, supported by relevant verses. The consequences listed are in line with Christian teachings. The student effectively connects the consequences of tempting God to both spiritual and personal realms. However, the section on implications for politically correct behavior seems less connected to the main topic and could have been further elaborated or related more directly to the concept of tempting God. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a good understanding of the subject matter."
