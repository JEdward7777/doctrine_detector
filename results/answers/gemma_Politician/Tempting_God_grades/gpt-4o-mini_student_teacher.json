  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 85.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive understanding of what it means to 'tempt God' from a biblical perspective, supported by relevant verses. They have also effectively outlined the consequences of tempting God, including both spiritual and personal implications. Additionally, the student has identified possible actions that can lead to temptation and has connected the concept of tempting God to the importance of humility and faith in political correctness.\n\nThe only area for improvement is to further emphasize the seriousness of divine punishment as a consequence of tempting God, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
