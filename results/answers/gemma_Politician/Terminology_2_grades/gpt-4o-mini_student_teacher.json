  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided an extensive list of terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper across various categories. However, the reference answer from the teacher focused on only two terms - 'communion' and 'Last Supper'. While the student's response showcases a thorough understanding of the varied terminology associated with the Lord's Supper within Christian communities, the lack of alignment with the teacher's specific answer detracts from the grade. A more focused and concise presentation of key terms mentioned in the reference answer would have resulted in a higher grade."
