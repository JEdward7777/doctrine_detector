  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge that different terms are used to refer to the Lord's Supper, it only mentions two terms: \"communion\" and \"Last Supper\". This is a limited understanding of the various terms used within Christianity to refer to this sacred practice. The concern asks for an understanding of the different terms, not just a mention of a few.\n\nTo improve, the response could have listed more terms commonly used in Christian contexts, such as those provided in the original prompt (e.g., \"The Eucharist\", \"Holy Communion\", etc.). Additionally, it would be helpful to provide some context or explanation for why these different terms are used, rather than just listing them."
