  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately mentions two terms, 'communion' and 'Last Supper', commonly used in Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper. However, it could be improved by providing a more comprehensive list of the various terms used within Christianity to refer to this sacred practice. The response demonstrates basic understanding but lacks depth in exploring the wide range of terms used in different contexts within Christian traditions."
