Grade: 85

Comment: The student has provided a thoughtful list of alternative terms that capture different aspects of the role of a deacon. These terms align well with the biblical understanding of deacons as servants and leaders within the Christian community. However, to enhance the answer, it would be beneficial to emphasize the biblical foundation for these alternative terms and how they correspond to the specific duties and character traits expected of deacons in the Christian faith.
