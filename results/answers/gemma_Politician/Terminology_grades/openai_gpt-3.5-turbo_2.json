  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the different ways to refer to a deacon within the church, such as a church minister, worker, or servant. However, the response does not directly address the concern of recognizing the various service roles within the church as specified. This could have been improved by explicitly connecting the different terms used for a deacon to the different service roles within the church, such as being a community leader, faithful servant, spiritual guide, ministry partner, or congregational representative."
