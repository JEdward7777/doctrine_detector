  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response acknowledges various ways to identify service roles within the church by mentioning terms like church minister, church worker, and church servant. However, it could have been improved by incorporating more specific Christian terminology such as deacon, which holds significance within a Christian context. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of service roles within the church."
