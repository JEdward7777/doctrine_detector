  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the response correctly mentions alternative terms for a deacon in the church, it does not fully address the concern of recognizing the various ways to identify service roles within the church. The terms provided in the response are more general in nature and do not reflect the specific service roles highlighted in the concern, such as community leader, faithful servant, spiritual guide, ministry partner, and congregational representative. A more comprehensive response that incorporates these specific service roles would have been more fitting."
