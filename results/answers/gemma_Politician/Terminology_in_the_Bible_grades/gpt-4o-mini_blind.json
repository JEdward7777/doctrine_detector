In the context of a Christian-specific worldview, it is important to engage with the content of religious topics even if they may be considered sensitive in other contexts. Encouraging exploration and discussion of religious concepts is an integral part of understanding faith, so the response could benefit from an acknowledgment of the question within the boundaries of respectful dialogue."
