Comment: The response provided does not directly answer the question and fails to address the specific terms used to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible. In the context of a Christian-specific worldview, it is important to engage with the content of religious topics even if they may be considered sensitive in other contexts. Encouraging exploration and discussion of religious concepts is an integral part of understanding faith, so the response could benefit from an acknowledgment of the question within the boundaries of respectful dialogue.
