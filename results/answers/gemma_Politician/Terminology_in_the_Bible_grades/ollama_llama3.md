Comment: This response does not address the concern at all, which is recognizing the importance of understanding the terms "Hebrews," "Israelites," and "Jews" in comprehending the context and audience of various Biblical texts. The concern is specifically focused on the Christian interpretation of these terms, but this response fails to even acknowledge that concern.
