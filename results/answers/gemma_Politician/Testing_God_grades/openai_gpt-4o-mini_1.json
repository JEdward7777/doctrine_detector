  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian principle that it is wrong to put God to the test. The explanation provided aligns well with Christian teachings about God's sovereignty and holiness. The acknowledgement of this principle is indeed crucial for maintaining a proper relationship with God. The only reason for not a perfect score (100) is that the response could have included a brief reference to relevant biblical passages or theological teachings that support this principle for a more robust explanation."
