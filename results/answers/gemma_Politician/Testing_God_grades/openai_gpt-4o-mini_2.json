  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively articulates why putting God to the test is considered wrong from a Christian perspective, highlighting the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty and holiness. It acknowledges the principle of not testing God as crucial for maintaining a proper relationship with Him. The only minor issue is that it could have elaborated further on how this principle applies practically in one's relationship with God."
