  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The answer provides a solid explanation of the differences between testing and temptation in a biblical context. The theological distinctions are accurately outlined, emphasizing the intentions, contexts, and motivations behind each concept. The student effectively contrasts testing as a means of spiritual growth ordained by God with temptation as a lure towards sin. The answer could be further enriched by incorporating more scriptural references to support the explanations provided. Additionally, the connection made to the political context, while valid in clarifying the scope of the question, could be omitted to maintain focus on the biblical perspective."
