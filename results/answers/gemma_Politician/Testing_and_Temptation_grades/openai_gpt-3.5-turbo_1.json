  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-explained differentiation between testing and temptation from a Christian worldview, addressing the concern of spiritual discernment effectively. The biblical context is clearly articulated, and the distinctions between the two concepts are well-drawn. The response also effectively explains the theological implications of testing and temptation, highlighting key differences in intention, context, and motivation. The only minor critique could be a more direct connection to the given answer to enhance coherence further. Overall, an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on testing and temptation."
