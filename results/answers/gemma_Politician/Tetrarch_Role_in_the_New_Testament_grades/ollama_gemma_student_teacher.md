## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the historical context of Herod Antipas and his involvement in New Testament events. However, it lacks specific details and fails to address the concern of understanding the historical and biblical context. The student's approach of avoiding political interpretations or controversial figures is commendable, but it could have benefited from a more comprehensive analysis of Herod Antipas's role in the New Testament narratives.
