Comment: The student's answer lacks engagement with the specific concern provided. While it is commendable to avoid speculation, in this case, the question is straightforward and requires basic knowledge of the Great Commission. Encouraging the student to study the Bible and understand key teachings like the Great Commission will help improve their response in the future.
