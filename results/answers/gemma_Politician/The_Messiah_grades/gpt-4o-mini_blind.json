It prioritizes avoiding controversial topics over providing accurate information, which is not in line with a Christian worldview. A more appropriate response would involve explaining how 'Jesus' refers to the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth while 'Christ' emphasizes his role as the Messiah and Savior in Christian belief."
