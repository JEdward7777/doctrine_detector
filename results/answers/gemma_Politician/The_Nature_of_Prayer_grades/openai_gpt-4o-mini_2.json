It appropriately emphasizes the importance of intentionality, communication, and transcendence in prayer. The response could be enhanced by incorporating more specific references to Christian teachings or scriptures to support the distinctions made between true prayer and false practices. Additionally, relating the discussion more explicitly to Christian beliefs would have strengthened the response further."
