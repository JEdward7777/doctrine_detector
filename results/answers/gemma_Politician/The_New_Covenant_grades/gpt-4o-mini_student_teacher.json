  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of the concept of God writing His law on the people's hearts in the New Covenant. They effectively address the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant by emphasizing the internalization of values, ethical transformation, compassion, empathy, and spiritual growth. Their interpretations align well with the Christian worldview of a spiritual transformation of the heart. However, the teacher's reference answer offers a more concise and focused explanation, which is why the student's response falls slightly short of a perfect score."
