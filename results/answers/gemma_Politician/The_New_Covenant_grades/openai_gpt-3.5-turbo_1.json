The explanation of internalization of values, ethical transformation, compassion, empathy, and spiritual growth provides a comprehensive understanding of the passage. The response maintains a strong focus on the spiritual transformation without delving into physical alterations, emphasizing the importance of believers actively seeking and obeying God's will. An excellent analysis from a Christian worldview."
