  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by explaining the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant through the internalization of God's laws and the transformative relationship with Him. The additional insights provided, such as ethical transformation, compassion, empathy, and spiritual growth, demonstrate a deep understanding of the passage. The response is clear, coherent, and consistent with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the spiritual transformation of the heart without delving into physical alterations."
