  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe student has provided a solid understanding of the concept of believers being glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. They correctly mention that this glorification is the ultimate destiny for followers of Christ, which is attained through Christ's sacrifice and resurrection. The emphasis on God's grace and mercy as the basis for this transformation is doctrinally correct. Additionally, the student acknowledges the importance of accepting Christ as Lord and Savior for this glorification to be realized.\n\nHowever, a higher grade could be achieved by delving deeper into the implications and significance of believers being glorified with Christ. Exploring how this glorification impacts believers' identity, purpose, and eternal destiny in a more detailed manner would enhance the response.\n\nOverall, this answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but there is room for further elaboration to provide a more comprehensive explanation."
