  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student accurately captures the essence of believers being glorified with Christ in the New Testament by emphasizing the ultimate destiny of believers through Christ's sacrifice and resurrection. They acknowledge the transformation that believers will experience, highlighting that it is based on God's grace and not human effort. However, the student's answer could have been more explicit in stating that believers will be transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection and share in His eternal glory, as indicated in the reference answer. Strengthening the focus on the believers' conformity to Christ in glory would have enhanced the depth of their response."
