## [Answer](../The_Role_of_Believers_in_Glory.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of believers being glorified with Christ refers to the ultimate destiny of those who follow him. It implies that through Christ's sacrifice and resurrection, believers will experience eternal life and complete union with God. This transformation is not based on any inherent qualities or actions of believers, but solely on God's grace and mercy. It is a glorious outcome that transcends human understanding and is offered freely to all who accept Christ as their Lord and Savior.</end_of_turn>

85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 85.

The student accurately captures the essence of believers being glorified with Christ in the New Testament by emphasizing the ultimate destiny of believers through Christ's sacrifice and resurrection. They acknowledge the transformation that believers will experience, highlighting that it is based on God's grace and not human effort. However, the student's answer could have been more explicit in stating that believers will be transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection and share in His eternal glory, as indicated in the reference answer. Strengthening the focus on the believers' conformity to Christ in glory would have enhanced the depth of their response.
