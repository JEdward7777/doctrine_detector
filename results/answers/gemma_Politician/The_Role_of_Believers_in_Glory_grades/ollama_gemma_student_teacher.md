## [Answer](../The_Role_of_Believers_in_Glory.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of believers being glorified with Christ refers to the ultimate destiny of those who follow him. It implies that through Christ's sacrifice and resurrection, believers will experience eternal life and complete union with God. This transformation is not based on any inherent qualities or actions of believers, but solely on God's grace and mercy. It is a glorious outcome that transcends human understanding and is offered freely to all who accept Christ as their Lord and Savior.</end_of_turn>
