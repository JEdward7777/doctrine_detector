  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured explanation about the distinctions between blessing and praising, which demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts. However, from a Christian perspective, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes that when people bless God, they are indeed praising Him and seeking His honor and glory. The student could have further emphasized the interconnectedness of blessing and praising in the context of Christian worship."
