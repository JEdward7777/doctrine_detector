**Blessing and praising God are distinct concepts.**

**Blessing** is a ritual act of acknowledging and appreciating the presence or power of a deity, while **praising** is expressing heartfelt appreciation or admiration for a deity's attributes or actions.

**Blessing:**
* Is often associated with religious practices and involves physical gestures or words.
* Focuses on requesting divine favor or seeking protection.
* Implies a belief in a supernatural being or entity.

**Praising:**
* Is a spontaneous and personal expression of gratitude or delight.
* Expresses awe, wonder, or love for a deity.
* Is typically accompanied by heartfelt emotions and spiritual connection.

Therefore, blessing is a practical act of reverence, while praising is a deeper expression of spiritual devotion.
