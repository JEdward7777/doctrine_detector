Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response completely missed the mark in addressing the relationship between 'cleansing' in the Bible and New Testament teachings on sin and redemption. The answer did not engage with the specific concern provided, failing to demonstrate an understanding of the significance of Christ's redemptive work in relation to the Old Testament practices. It is important for the student to focus on the religious aspects of the question and provide a response that aligns with the Christian worldview presented in the reference answer.
