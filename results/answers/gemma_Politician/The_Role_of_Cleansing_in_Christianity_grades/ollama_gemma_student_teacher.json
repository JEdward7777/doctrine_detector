  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the relationship between 'cleansing' in the Bible and New Testament teachings on sin and redemption. However, it lacks specific examples or elaboration on how these concepts are interconnected. Additionally, the student's refusal to acknowledge the connection between religious concepts and political ideologies unnecessarily limits the scope of the answer."
