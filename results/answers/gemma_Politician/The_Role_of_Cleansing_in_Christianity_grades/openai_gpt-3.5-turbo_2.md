Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible in relation to New Testament teachings on sin and redemption. It appropriately connects Jesus' sacrifice to provide ultimate cleansing from sin. However, the concern raised about understanding the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings could have been addressed to further enhance the depth of the response from a Christian worldview.
