While it correctly discusses the concept of cleansing in the Bible, it does not connect this to the significance of Christ's redemptive work, as highlighted in the concern. Additionally, the response misses an opportunity to showcase how Old Testament practices point towards and are fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus."
