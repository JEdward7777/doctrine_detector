It acknowledges God's sovereignty in appointing leaders and emphasizes His divine purpose and plans for leadership among His followers. The answer aligns well with Christian beliefs regarding divine election and demonstrates an understanding of the significance of chosen ones in the Christian community. The only improvement would be to reference specific Biblical passages that support the claim about God's selection process, further bolstering the argument from a Christian perspective."
