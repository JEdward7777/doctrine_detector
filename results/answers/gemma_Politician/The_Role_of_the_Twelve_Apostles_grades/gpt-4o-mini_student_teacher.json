  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a strong explanation of the significance of the twelve apostles among Jesus' disciples, highlighting their role as chosen companions and witnesses of Jesus' ministry. They correctly acknowledged the apostles' crucial role in spreading the Christian faith and shaping early Christianity. The answer closely aligns with the reference answer provided by the teacher, but could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the task of continuing Jesus' teachings after His ascension, as emphasized in the Christian belief and ministry."
