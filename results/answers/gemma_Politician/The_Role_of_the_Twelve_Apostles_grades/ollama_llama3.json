  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively conveys the significance of the apostles in Christian history, highlighting their importance as Jesus' closest companions and witnesses to his ministry. It also accurately states that they played a crucial role in spreading the faith and shaping Christianity.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by explicitly stating the connection between the apostles' roles and their subsequent responsibility to continue Jesus' teachings after his ascension, as stated in the answer. This is particularly important given the concern about recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry.\n\nThe comment for this grade would be: \"This response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the apostles, but could be strengthened by more explicitly highlighting their role in continuing Jesus' teachings after his ascension.\""
