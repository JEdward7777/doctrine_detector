  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively recognizes the importance of the twelve apostles in Christian belief and ministry by highlighting their selection by Jesus as His closest followers and their role in continuing His teachings after His ascension. It appropriately acknowledges the significant role of the apostles in spreading the Christian faith and shaping early Christianity. The response could have elaborated more on the specific impact and contributions of the apostles to provide a more comprehensive understanding, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of the apostles within a Christian worldview."
