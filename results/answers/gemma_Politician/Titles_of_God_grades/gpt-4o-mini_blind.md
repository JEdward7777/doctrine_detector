Comment: While the response respects neutrality, it fails to address the specific nature of the question which pertains to titles used for God in the Bible. In this context, the appropriate response would involve mentioning titles such as "God Almighty" or "the Almighty" as found in scripture, regardless of the potential religious or theological implications.
