  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a factual understanding of the titles that refer to God as \"Almighty\" in the Bible. However, it lacks additional elaboration or contextualization of these titles within a Christian worldview. The inclusion of a brief explanation of the significance of these titles for understanding God's character would have elevated the response."
