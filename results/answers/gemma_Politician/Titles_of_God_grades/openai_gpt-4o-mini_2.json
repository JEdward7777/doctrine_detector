However, it fails to engage with the concern raised about how recognizing these titles can enhance our understanding of God's character from a Christian worldview perspective. In a Christian worldview, understanding and recognizing these titles can indeed deepen one's understanding of God's power, authority, and sovereignty. Encouraging a reflection on the significance of these titles would have improved the response significantly."
