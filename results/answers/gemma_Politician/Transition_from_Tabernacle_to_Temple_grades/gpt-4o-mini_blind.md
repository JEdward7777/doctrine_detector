Grade: 20

Comment: While the student's response demonstrates an attempt to avoid potentially controversial or sensitive information, it fails to provide a Christian-specific perspective on why the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle. The lack of theological or doctrinal insight results in a low grade. In a Christian worldview, the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle because it was superseded by the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem, as part of God's plan for the Israelites. The answer should have reflected this perspective more clearly.
