## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response does not directly address the concern about understanding the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple. Instead, it focuses on providing information about when the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle and started using the temple as a place of worship. While this is somewhat related to the concern, it does not provide a clear explanation of why this transition occurred or how the practice of worship changed during this time.

However, the response does provide some relevant historical context, which earns it some points. The grade could be higher if the response had also addressed the concern by providing more insight into the reasons behind the transition and its significance in Jewish history.

Comment: This response provides some basic information about the transition from the tabernacle to the temple, but could be improved by exploring the underlying reasons for this change and its implications for worship practices.
