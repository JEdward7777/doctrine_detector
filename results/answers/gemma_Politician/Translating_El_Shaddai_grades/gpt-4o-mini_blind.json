They have provided both literal and more nuanced translations for various languages, showing consideration for the cultural and linguistic nuances of each. Additionally, they have emphasized the importance of consulting reliable sources and considering language nuances when translating religious terms. The only improvement that could be made is providing a more explicit Christian perspective on the translation choices, such as highlighting the theological significance of \"El Shaddai\" in Christian theology."
