Comment: The student provided thorough translations and nuances for 'El Shaddai' in different languages, which shows a good understanding of linguistic considerations. However, the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages could have been better addressed by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the original meaning and significance of 'God Almighty' in the translations. The student should have also considered the theological implications of 'El Shaddai' and its attributes in the translations provided. Overall, while the translations were well thought out, the fidelity to the original meaning could be more strongly emphasized from a Christian worldview perspective.
