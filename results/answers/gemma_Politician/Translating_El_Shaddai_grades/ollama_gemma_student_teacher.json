  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive research and detailed translation considerations for various languages.\n* Consideration of cultural contexts and nuances in different Bible translations.\n* Inclusion of both literal and more nuanced translations for each language.\n* Clear and concise explanations for each translation option.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The student's suggested translations (\"God Almighty\" or \"Shaddai\") are not explicitly referenced in the reference answer. \n* The student's grade could be slightly higher if they had elaborated on the significance of preserving the phonetic accuracy of the original term.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological significance and linguistic challenges of translating \"El Shaddai.\""
