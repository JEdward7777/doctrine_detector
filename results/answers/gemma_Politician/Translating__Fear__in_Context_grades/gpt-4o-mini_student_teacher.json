  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the different ways 'fear' can be translated when referring to God, showcasing a strong understanding of the nuances involved. The explanations were well-developed and considered various aspects of fear in a religious context. The student also highlighted the importance of understanding these translations in shaping one's faith and spiritual life. However, the student's answer could have focused more on aligning with the teacher's reference answer, which emphasized 'deep respect,' 'reverence,' or 'awe' of God as key translations for fear. Overall, a solid response with room for minor improvements in alignment with the specified concern."
