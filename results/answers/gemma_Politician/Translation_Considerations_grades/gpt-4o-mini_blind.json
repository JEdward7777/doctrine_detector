While respecting diverse perspectives is vital, in a Christian worldview, it is important to prioritize doctrinal correctness and the faithful representation of Biblical terms, even if they may be perceived as controversial or sensitive by some. The answer lacks a robust discussion of the significance of 'Zion' and 'Daughter' in Biblical texts from a Christian perspective."
