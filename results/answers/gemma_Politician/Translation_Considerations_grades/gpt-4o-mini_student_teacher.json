  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While it is commendable that the student is mindful of sensitive terminology, in the context of Biblical translations and the concern provided, the focus should be on the importance of retaining terms like 'Zion' and 'Daughter' due to their spiritual and cultural significance. The student's response does not directly address this aspect, resulting in a lower grade."
