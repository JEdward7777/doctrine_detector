  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of preserving cultural and spiritual significance in translations. However, it lacks specific elaboration on the significance of the terms 'Zion' and 'Daughter' within a Biblical context. The response could benefit from further elaboration on the figurative meanings and historical contexts of these terms in the Biblical texts."
