Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of maintaining key terms like 'Zion' and 'Daughter' for their spiritual and cultural significance in conveying the original text's meaning. It aligns well with the concern of ensuring the preservation of the rich biblical heritage in translations. The only area for improvement would be to provide more depth or examples to further support the argument.
