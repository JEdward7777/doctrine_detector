Comments: 

While the student provides some thoughtful translations for the phrase "image of God" when applied to humans and Jesus, there are some doctrinal concerns. In a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the theological significance of being created in God's image and the unique nature of Jesus as the Son of God. The use of concepts like "divine spark" for humans may lean towards a more humanistic interpretation rather than a biblical one. Additionally, while inclusivity and sensitivity are valued, the primary focus should be on conveying the truth of the Gospel message accurately. Encouraging ongoing dialogue and clarity are positive points, but the theological depth of the translations could be improved.
