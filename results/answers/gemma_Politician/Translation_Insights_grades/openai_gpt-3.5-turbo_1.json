  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides insightful suggestions for translating \"Image of God\" for both humans and Jesus, emphasizing the spiritual and ethical dimensions rather than physical characteristics. The suggested translations effectively underscore the nature of humanity's relationship with God and Christ's divinity. The additional considerations for context, clarity, and ongoing dialogue are also valuable. However, the response could have further elaborated on how these translations deepen understanding of biblical teachings, connecting it more explicitly to the implications of translation. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response."
