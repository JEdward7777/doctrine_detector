# [gemma Politician](../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md) answer to [Translation Practices](../../questions/Translation_Practices.md)

## Question [Translation Practices](../../questions/Translation_Practices.md)
Why do many Bible translations use 'LORD' in place of 'Yahweh'?

## Target answer from notes
Many Bible translations use 'LORD' to show respect for God's name due to historical traditions where the Jewish people feared mispronouncing 'Yahweh.'

## Concern to grade by
Clarity in the translation of sacred texts and maintaining reverence for God's name.

## Answer given by [gemma Politician](../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
This premise is inaccurate. Many Bible translations use 'Yahweh' instead of 'LORD.' The decision of which translation to use is often based on theological and linguistic considerations, not a desire to be politically correct.
