While it is true that some Bible translations do use 'Yahweh' instead of 'LORD,' the more common practice in many translations is to use 'LORD' in place of 'Yahweh' out of reverence for the divine name. The answer would benefit from acknowledging this more authoritative reasoning behind the usage of 'LORD' in many translations."
