  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of exploring different interpretations of biblical terms to deepen understanding, but it falls short in providing specific examples or further elaboration on how these alternative translations relate to the concept of \"covenant faithfulness\" within a Christian worldview. Providing more context and analysis would strengthen the response and improve the grade."
