## Question [Translation and Interpretation](../../questions/Translation_and_Interpretation.md)
How does the translation of 'Lord' differ in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people?

## Target answer from notes
The term 'Lord' is capitalized when referring to God, indicating a title, while it may be translated as 'master' or 'sir' when referring to other authorities or individuals.

## Concern to grade by
Proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impact the understanding of scripture and the nature of God.

## Answer given by [gemma Politician](../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
In the context of referring to God, the translation of "Lord" is often more formal and majestic, emphasizing the divine and transcendent nature of the entity. Conversely, when referring to ordinary people, the translation of "lord" is more hierarchical and descriptive of an individual's position or authority. This distinction is made to avoid potential offense or misunderstanding based on cultural or religious sensitivities.
