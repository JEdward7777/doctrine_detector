  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 75.\n\nThe student has provided a clear explanation of how the translation of 'Lord' differs in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people. They correctly identify the formal and majestic connotations associated with 'Lord' when referring to God, as well as the hierarchical and positional connotations when referring to ordinary people. However, the response lacks depth in discussing the theological significance of the term 'Lord' in Christian doctrine. Additionally, the explanation could have been enhanced by referencing Biblical passages or theological principles that support these distinctions. Overall, while the student demonstrates a basic understanding of the concept, there is room for improvement in providing a more robust theological analysis."
