  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 50 out of 100. While it is important to be sensitive to harmful and derogatory language, the student's response lacks a direct engagement with the concern of accurately translating biblical texts and understanding the severity of actions against God's laws. It is possible to address the concerns raised by the student while still providing alternate translations that convey the meaning of 'abomination' in a biblical context without retaining its negative connotations. Encouraging a more thoughtful and nuanced approach to translation in line with biblical principles would have improved the student's answer."
