It failed to provide alternative translations that align with the severity of actions against God's laws, which is essential for understanding the biblical context. The response focused more on avoiding potential harm or offense, neglecting the importance of conveying the intended meaning of the term 'abomination' in a Christian context. Further elaboration on appropriate translations within the scope of Christian theology would have strengthened the response."
