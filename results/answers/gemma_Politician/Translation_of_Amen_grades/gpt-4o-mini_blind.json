There is a good balance between maintaining literal accuracy, emphasizing sincerity, and considering contextual variations. However, in a Christian specific worldview, it would be important to highlight the significance of the term \"truly\" in conveying the authority of Jesus' statements, reflecting His divine nature and truthfulness. Additionally, emphasizing the spiritual and doctrinal aspects associated with the word 'truly' would have enhanced the response and aligned it more closely with a Christian worldview."
