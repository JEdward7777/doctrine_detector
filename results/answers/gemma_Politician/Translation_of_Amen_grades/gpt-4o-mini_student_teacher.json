  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of potential translations of 'truly' as used by Jesus, considering various contexts and tones. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes the importance of sincerity in the translation, which the student did not incorporate fully in their suggestions. The student could improve their answer by prioritizing the aspect of sincerity more strongly in the potential translations provided."
