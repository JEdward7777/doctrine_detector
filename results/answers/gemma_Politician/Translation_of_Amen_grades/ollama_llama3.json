  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of highlighting the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation, specifically in regards to Jesus' use of the word \"truly\". It provides a comprehensive list of potential translations and explanations for each, demonstrating a deep understanding of the issue. The consideration section also adds value by emphasizing the need for context-dependent options and avoiding biased or offensive language.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 20 points because the response does not directly address Jesus' use of \"truly\" in relation to the given answer (\"Yes, I tell you sincerely\" or \"What I am telling you is true.\"). While the provided translations are relevant, they could be more explicitly connected to the original statement. Additionally, while the considerations are valuable, they could be more detailed and concrete in terms of their application.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of biblical translation and interpretation, but could benefit from more explicit connections between Jesus' use of \"truly\" and the provided answer."
