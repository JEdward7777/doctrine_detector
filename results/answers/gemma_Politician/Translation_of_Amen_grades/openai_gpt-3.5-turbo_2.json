The inclusion of considerations about context, audience, and sensitivity to bias is commendable. However, the response could be enhanced by directly addressing the concern of accurate biblical translation and interpretation more explicitly throughout the discussion. Additionally, linking the specific translations to the given answer 'Yes, I tell you sincerely' or 'What I am telling you is true' would have further strengthened the response."
