Grade: 95

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of proper translation in conveying the accurate meaning of God's titles in Scripture from a Christian worldview. The connection between language and conveying the divine nature is well articulated. The deductive points are minimal as the response respects religious sensitivity while still providing relevant information.
