However, the suggestions lacked a solid foundation in biblical theology. It is essential to prioritize the accuracy and fidelity to the biblical text when translating these terms. More emphasis on the doctrinal significance and nuances of 'Hades' and 'Sheol' in the Bible would have strengthened the answer. Additionally, the tips for avoiding offensiveness could have been more directly tied to maintaining biblical integrity in translation rather than solely focused on potentially offending modern sensibilities."
