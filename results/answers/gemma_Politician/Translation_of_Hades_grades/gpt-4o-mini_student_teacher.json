However, there is room for improvement in aligning the translations more closely with the teacher's reference answer, which focuses on clarity and simplicity. The student's additional considerations and tips for avoiding offensiveness demonstrate a good awareness of potential pitfalls in translation, but the primary concern of accurate biblical representation could be addressed more directly by sticking closer to the reference answer in this context."
