## Reliable Translation Options for Hades and Sheol:

**Hades:**

* **Spirit realm:** Emphasizes the underworld as a place of spiritual presence.
* **Field of shadows:** Highlights the shadowy nature of the underworld.
* **Place of silence:** Focuses on the stillness and isolation of Hades.
* **Underworld sanctuary:** Represents Hades as a refuge for the deceased.

**Sheol:**

* **Forgotten realm:** Highlights the idea of oblivion and lack of remembrance in Sheol.
* **Silent tomb:** Emphasizes the finality and quietness of death in Sheol.
