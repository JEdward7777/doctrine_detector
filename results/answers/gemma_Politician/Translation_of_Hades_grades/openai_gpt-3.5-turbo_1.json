  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good range of reliable translation options for 'Hades' and 'Sheol' while showing sensitivity to the biblical context and audience awareness. It appropriately emphasizes the importance of context and maintaining ambiguity where necessary. The tips for avoiding offensiveness are insightful and relevant. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern of ensuring accurate biblical representation in translations for greater understanding among believers. Overall, the content is well-rounded and informative from a Christian worldview perspective."
