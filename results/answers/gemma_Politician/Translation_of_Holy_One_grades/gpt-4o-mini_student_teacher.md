## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: While it is commendable that the student is conscious of respecting diverse beliefs and sensitivities, in this context, it is necessary to engage with the question from a Christian worldview perspective. The student could have provided a neutral answer that considered the theological implications without imposing specific religious beliefs.
