Comment: The response respectfully addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of accurately representing the term to maintain its theological implications. It shows an understanding of the significance of preserving the meaning and sacredness associated with religious terminology. However, deducting a few points for not directly engaging with the Christian worldview aspect or providing a deeper analysis from that perspective.
