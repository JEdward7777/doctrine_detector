Comment: While it is commendable that the student is mindful of diversity and sensitivity in discussing theological topics, their response does not directly address the question asked. In a Christian specific worldview, it is important to provide accurate and doctrinally sound translations of terms like 'predestined'. The student missed an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the theological concepts involved.
