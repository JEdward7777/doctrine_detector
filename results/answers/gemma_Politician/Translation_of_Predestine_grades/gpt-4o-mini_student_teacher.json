  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response fails to address the concern of ensuring accurate understanding of biblical translations related to predestination. While it is important to respect diverse perspectives and sensitivities, the student missed the opportunity to provide suggested translations based on the context of predestination within a Christian worldview. Therefore, a low grade is given for not meeting the specific requirement of the question."
