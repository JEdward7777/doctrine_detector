  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 75.\n\nWhile the student covers a wide range of considerations for translating the term 'Rabbi' in various languages, there is a lack of depth in addressing the theological and doctrinal implications of translating a religious title. In a Christian worldview, it would have been important for the student to discuss how accurately translating 'Rabbi' impacts the understanding of Jesus as the ultimate Rabbi in Christianity. Additionally, considerations of the honor and reverence associated with religious titles, especially in Judeo-Christian contexts, could have been highlighted for more depth.\n\nThe student provides good practical advice on cultural sensitivity, linguistic accuracy, and inclusivity, which are essential considerations. However, a stronger emphasis on how translations could affect theological concepts and the implications of translating religious titles would have enhanced the response from a Christian perspective."
