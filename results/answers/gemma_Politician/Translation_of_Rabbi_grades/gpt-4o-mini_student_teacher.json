  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of considerations for translating the term 'Rabbi' in various languages, taking into account cultural context, religious sensitivities, gender inclusivity, linguistic accuracy, and universal terms. However, the answer lacks a direct reference to ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith as specified in the concern. While the answer covers important aspects of translation, a stronger connection to the Christian worldview and the unique significance of Jesus as a Rabbi would have enhanced the response."
