  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The suggestion to respect the title's significance without implying that Jesus was merely a schoolteacher is relevant to this concern, as it acknowledges Jesus' divine authority and wisdom in teaching.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly address Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. While it mentions considering how teachers are typically addressed in the target language, it does not specifically discuss Jesus' unique teaching ministry or its significance within Christianity.\n\nTo improve this response, it could be enhanced by providing more specific and contextualized guidance on translating the term \"Rabbi\" in light of Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith. For example, it could suggest using translations that convey Jesus' authority, wisdom, and divine commission to teach, rather than simply emphasizing his human role as a teacher.\n\nComment: While this response provides some general guidance on translating the term \"Rabbi,\" it could be strengthened by more explicitly addressing the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith."
