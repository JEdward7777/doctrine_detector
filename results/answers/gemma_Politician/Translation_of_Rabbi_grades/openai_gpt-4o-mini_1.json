The emphasis on respecting the significance of the title without diminishing Jesus' role as a teacher aligns well with the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' teaching role within the Christian faith. The response effectively addresses the concern within a Christian worldview by advocating for a translation that maintains reverence for Jesus' teaching role while also considering the target language's norms for addressing teachers."
