Grade: 50

Comment: While it is important to be sensitive to cultural differences and avoid using offensive language, the student failed to address the question from a Christian worldview perspective. In this context, the term 'ransom' has significant theological implications related to the atonement and redemption through Christ. The response could have acknowledged this while still emphasizing the importance of respecting cultural sensitivities.
