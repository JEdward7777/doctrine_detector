  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 30. \n\nWhile it is important to be sensitive to cultural differences and avoid using offensive language, in this context, the concern is specifically related to accurately translating theological terms across languages. The student's response does not address this concern and does not provide any insight into how the term 'ransom' could be accurately translated in different languages while maintaining its theological meaning. The student missed the opportunity to engage with the question in a way that upholds theological accuracy across linguistic and cultural contexts."
