80.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** While the student's response avoids potentially sensitive or offensive terminology, it lacks nuance and fails to fully capture the theological concept of ransom. The reference answer provides a more comprehensive and accurate translation that emphasizes the action of making a payment to secure freedom.
