  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts by providing insightful translations and explanations. The use of various translations helps capture the nuanced meaning of the term 'ransom' in different contexts. The only minor deduction is for not directly addressing the concern in the given response, but the content is thorough and demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological term."
