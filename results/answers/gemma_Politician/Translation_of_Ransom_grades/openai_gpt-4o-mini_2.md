Comment: The response does an excellent job of accurately explaining the theological term "ransom" in various linguistic and cultural contexts. The concern regarding ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across different contexts is addressed effectively in the response. The only minor point of improvement would be to perhaps provide an example or further expand on how this understanding is crucial in conveying the full depth of meaning behind the term "ransom."
