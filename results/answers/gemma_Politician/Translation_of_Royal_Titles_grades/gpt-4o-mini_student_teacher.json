  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, considering both direct translations and more creative adaptations. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency' which the student did not include in their response. Additionally, there could have been more emphasis on finding natural ways of addressing a ruler in the target language, in alignment with biblical teachings on respect and honor towards authority figures. The student's response is well-researched and informative but could have been improved by incorporating the teacher's guidance on appropriate translations more directly."
