  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough list of appropriate translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, showing sensitivity to cultural nuances and the importance of context and audience. It respects biblical teachings by highlighting the need for accuracy and respect in translations of titles. The only suggestion for improvement would be to ensure that the translations provided align more explicitly with biblical principles when addressing rulers or authorities."
