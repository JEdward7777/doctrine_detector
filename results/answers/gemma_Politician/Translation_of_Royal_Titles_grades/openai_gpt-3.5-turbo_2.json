  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough list of appropriate translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, taking into consideration the context, audience, and sensitivity of language translations. The additional considerations given show a good level of thoughtfulness in ensuring accurate and respectful translations. This aligns well with biblical teachings of showing respect and consideration towards rulers and others in authority. The only slight deduction is that the original answer provided a very brief overview of translations without delving into the specifics mentioned in the detailed response."
