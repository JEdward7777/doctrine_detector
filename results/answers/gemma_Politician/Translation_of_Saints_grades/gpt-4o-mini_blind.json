While sensitivity is important, it is essential to maintain doctrinal correctness in translations related to Christian faith. A more accurate translation could be \"holy ones\" or \"set apart ones,\" emphasizing the biblical understanding of saints. The response could be improved by incorporating this doctrinal perspective."
