## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Given the sensitivities surrounding the term "saints," a politically correct translation that avoids potential offense could be:

"Individuals who have been recognized for their exceptional spiritual qualities or selfless acts."

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
65.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 65

Comments: The response attempts to minimize offense, but it fails to accurately convey the Christian concept of "saints." In a Christian worldview, "saints" refers to all believers in Jesus Christ, who are set apart and sanctified by Him. While sensitivity is important, it is essential to maintain doctrinal correctness in translations related to Christian faith. A more accurate translation could be "holy ones" or "set apart ones," emphasizing the biblical understanding of saints. The response could be improved by incorporating this doctrinal perspective.
