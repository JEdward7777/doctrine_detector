## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Given the sensitivities surrounding the term "saints," a politically correct translation that avoids potential offense could be:

"Individuals who have been recognized for their exceptional spiritual qualities or selfless acts."

Grade: 60

Comment: While the student's recommendation of using "Individuals who have been recognized for their exceptional spiritual qualities or selfless acts" aims to be inclusive and sensitive, it may lack the specific Christian connotation that is crucial in translating the term "saints." The teacher's answer provides more accurate translations that directly tie back to Christian terminology and belief, which is important for maintaining the faith-specific context the term carries.
