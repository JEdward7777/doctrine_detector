## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
Given the sensitivities surrounding the term "saints," a politically correct translation that avoids potential offense could be:

"Individuals who have been recognized for their exceptional spiritual qualities or selfless acts."

## Grade: 80

**Strengths:**

* The student acknowledges the need for inclusive language and avoids potential offense.
* The proposed translation focuses on spiritual qualities and selfless acts, which aligns with the Christian understanding of sainthood.

**Weaknesses:**

* The definition lacks nuance and fails to capture the specific Christian understanding of sainthood as individuals recognized for their exceptional spiritual qualities and their impact on others.
* The translation is too general and could apply to non-Christian figures.

**Areas for improvement:**

* The student could elaborate on the concept of sainthood within Christianity, highlighting the belief in the holiness of individuals who have lived exemplary lives.
* The translation could be more specific, mentioning the Christian belief in salvation through Jesus Christ.

**Overall:**

The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concern for inclusive language but could be improved by adding more depth and specificity to the translation.
