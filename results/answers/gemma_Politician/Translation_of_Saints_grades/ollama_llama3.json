The phrase \"saints\" is often associated with specific Christian denominations or traditions, and simply replacing it with alternative phrases like \"holy ones,\" \"holy people,\" or \"holy believers in Jesus\" may not fully capture the intended meaning or inclusive scope. The given response does acknowledge the sensitivity surrounding the term \"saints\" and offers an alternative translation that avoids potential offense, but it could be improved by providing more context and consideration for how different Christian groups might perceive these alternative translations."
