  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The suggested translation provided in the response, 'holy believers in Jesus,' effectively maintains the Christian connotation of 'saints' without exclusivity to specific Christian denominations. It aligns well with the concern for inclusive language by emphasizing the shared belief in Jesus among all believers. However, the original answer could have further expanded on alternative translations beyond just 'holy believers in Jesus' to provide additional depth and precision in the suggested translations."
