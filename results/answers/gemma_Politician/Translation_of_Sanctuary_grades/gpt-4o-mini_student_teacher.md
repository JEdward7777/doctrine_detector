Grade: 80

Comment: The student has provided a thorough and thoughtful response to the question, considering various aspects of translation such as context, audience, inclusive language, historical and cultural sensitivity, and alternatives. However, the answer lacks a direct connection to the concern of maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms. It would have been stronger if the student explicitly addressed this concern and emphasized the importance of accurately reflecting the Biblical definition of 'sanctuary.'
