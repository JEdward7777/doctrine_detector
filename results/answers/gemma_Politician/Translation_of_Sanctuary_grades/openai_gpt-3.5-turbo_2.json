  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides thorough considerations for translating the term \"sanctuary\" in modern texts, showing a sensitivity to context, audience, inclusivity, historical significance, diverse perspectives, and consultation with experts. The suggested alternatives are appropriate and respectful of the term's importance. The answer also correctly emphasizes the importance of maintaining the original Biblical meaning of the term. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly mention the need for accuracy in translating Biblical terms, in addition to maintaining their original meaning. Overall, this is a well-thought-out and culturally sensitive response."
