The suggested alternatives and additional considerations demonstrate a thorough approach to addressing the concern of maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms during translation. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the theological significance of \"sanctuary\" within a Christian worldview to ensure that the translation accurately reflects its Biblical definition as a holy and sacred place."
