  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer at 85.\n\nWhile the student accurately identifies and expands upon the implications of translating 'Savior' as 'the One who Saves' or 'who Rescues from Enemies', demonstrating a thoughtful analysis of the topic, their answer lacks specificity in directly addressing the concern of how language shapes theological understanding and faith practices. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of the translation provided in the reference answer from the teacher.\n\nOverall, the student provided a well-thought-out response with room for improvement in directly addressing the concern and incorporating more theological depth."
