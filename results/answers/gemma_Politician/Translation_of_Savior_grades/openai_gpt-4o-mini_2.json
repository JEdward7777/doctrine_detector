  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively demonstrates how translating 'Savior' as 'the One who saves' or 'who rescues from enemies' influences theological understanding by emphasizing God's active role in protecting and redeeming His people. The analysis of the implications is thorough and well-structured, aligning with a Christian worldview that focuses on God's universal salvific power and love. The potential concerns are acknowledged and carefully addressed. Overall, this response effectively explores how language shapes theological understanding and faith practices within a Christian perspective."
