  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a nuanced understanding of the implications of translating \"trespass\" as either \"sin\" or \"breaking the rule\". The writer recognizes that using these terms can have various consequences, including oversimplification, ambiguity, and potential offense. They also offer alternative approaches to addressing interpersonal conflicts within a church community.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from more explicit connections to scriptural integrity and community values. While the concern mentions ensuring alignment with scriptural integrity, this aspect is not fully incorporated into the response. However, the writer's approach is generally sound, and their suggestions for alternative approaches demonstrate a thoughtful consideration of the issue.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the implications of translating \"trespass\" and offers practical solutions for addressing interpersonal conflicts within a church community. To further strengthen this response, it would be helpful to explicitly connect these ideas to scriptural principles and community values, ensuring that they align with the concern."
