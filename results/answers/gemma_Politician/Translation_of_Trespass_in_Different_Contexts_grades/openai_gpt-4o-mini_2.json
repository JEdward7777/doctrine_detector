It explores various concerns such as distortion of the sin concept, ambiguity and confusion, cultural and theological sensitivities, potential for offense, and the emphasis on rules over relationships. The alternative approaches suggested are practical and align well with the concern of ensuring scriptural integrity and community values. However, there could be a deeper integration of Christian-specific theological perspectives to strengthen the argument further."
