  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's answer attempts to be inclusive and sensitive to diverse beliefs, it falls short in accurately conveying the specific meaning and significance of \"house of Yahweh\" in a Christian context. The reference answer provided by the teacher emphasizes the essential aspect of worship and the presence of Yahweh, which is crucial in understanding the importance of such spaces. The student's translation could be considered acceptable in a more general context, but in the context of Christian theology and worship, a more direct translation would be preferred."
