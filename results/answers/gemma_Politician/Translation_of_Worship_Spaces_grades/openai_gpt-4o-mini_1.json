However, the original answer's emphasis on the direct worship of Yahweh in the translation as 'Yahweh\u2019s temple' aligns more closely with the concern of accurately conveying the concept of worship spaces. While the politically correct approach is valid, a stronger connection to the worship aspect would have improved the translation further."
