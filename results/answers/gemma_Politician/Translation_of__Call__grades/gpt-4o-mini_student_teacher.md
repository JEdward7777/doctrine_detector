## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
70.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's answer a 70.

While the student correctly emphasizes the importance of consulting reliable theological sources and respected scholars for accurate interpretations of religious passages, they could have still provided a general alternative translation while acknowledging that nuanced interpretations should be handled with care. Encouraging caution in interpretations is crucial, but providing a basic alternative translation that is faithful to the original context would have made for a more comprehensive answer.
