  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive comparison of the translation of \"elect\" across older and modern English Bible versions, highlighting the nuances in meaning and implications for understanding Scripture. The response effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God. The student's analysis is well-organized, detailed, and insightful. However, the student could strengthen their response by incorporating the teacher's reference answer, which emphasizes the impact on the reader's understanding of their identity as God's people."
