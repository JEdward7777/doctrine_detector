## Question [Translation of 'Elect'](../../../questions/Translation_of__Elect_.md)
In what ways does the translation of 'elect' differ in older and modern English Bible versions, and what impact does this have on understanding Scripture?

## Correct Answer
Older Bible versions use 'elect' in both the Old and New Testaments, while modern versions often use 'chosen ones' in the Old Testament and 'elect' primarily in the New Testament, which may affect the reader's understanding of their identity as God's people.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God.

## [Answer](../Translation_of__Elect_.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
## Differences in the Translation of "Elect" Across English Bible Versions:

**Older English:**

* Many early translations used "chosen" or "ordained," reflecting a focus on God's sovereign selection and predestination.
* Some versions also employed "deemed worthy" or "favoured," highlighting God's grace and preferential treatment.

**Modern English:**

* Modern translations generally settle on "chosen," attempting to balance the concepts of divine predeestination and individual responsibility.
* Some versions use "selected" or "picked out," emphasizing God's act of choosing but without implying absolute predestination.
* Others translate it as "blessed" or "favoured," focusing on God's grace and abundance towards believers.


## Impact on Understanding Scripture:

**1. Emphasis on Divine Sovereignty:**

* Older translations that emphasize "chosen" or "ordained" foster a strong sense of God's sovereignty and predestination, highlighting how God picks some for salvation regardless of their actions.

**2. Balancing Grace and Responsibility:**

* Modern translations balancing "chosen" with other terms suggests that God's selection is not solely based on his own will but also involves human response to his grace.

**3. Inclusive Interpretation:**

* Translating "elect" as "blessed" or "favoured" can appeal to a wider audience as it emphasizes God's general grace and abundance rather than specific election to salvation.


**4. Avoiding Controversy:**

* Choosing more neutral terms like "selected" or "blessed" avoids potential debates about predestination and free will, which can be controversial in contemporary society.

**5. Clarity for Contemporary Audiences:**

* Modern translations prioritize clarity and accessibility for contemporary readers, who may be unfamiliar with older English terminology.


**Conclusion:**

The changing translation of "elect" reflects the evolution of English Bible interpretation and the desire to balance theological concepts with broader audience comprehension and sensitivity. While older versions emphasize God's sovereignty, modern translations prioritize clarity and inclusivity while addressing the sensitive issue of predestination.

I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response does an excellent job of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts related to being chosen by God, particularly in regards to the translation of "elect" across different English Bible versions. The discussion is well-organized and covers various aspects of the topic, including the historical context of older translations, the balance between divine sovereignty and human responsibility in modern translations, and the impact on our understanding of Scripture.

The only areas for improvement are that the response could benefit from more explicit connections to the concern about clarifying the meaning of biblical texts. Additionally, while the discussion is generally thorough, it could delve deeper into specific examples or scriptural passages to further illustrate the points being made.

Overall, this is a strong response that effectively explores the translation and interpretation of "elect" in different English Bible versions and its implications for our understanding of being chosen by God.
