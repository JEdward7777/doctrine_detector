  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the differences in the translation of \"elect\" across English Bible versions and the impact on understanding Scripture. It addresses the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God by providing insights into the theological implications of different translations. The response is well-structured, informative, and offers a Christian perspective on the topic. It could be slightly improved by delving deeper into the theological nuances of divine sovereignty and human responsibility in relation to being chosen by God."
