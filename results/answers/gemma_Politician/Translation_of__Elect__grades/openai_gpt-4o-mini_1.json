  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God. It provides a thorough explanation of the differences in translation of \"elect\" across English Bible versions, discussing the impact on understanding Scripture from various perspectives. The conclusion ties the analysis together well. However, the response could have strengthened its evaluation by drawing more explicitly on Christian theology and addressing the theological implications of the different translations in a more direct manner."
