However, their focus on cultural sensitivity, inclusiveness, accessibility, and tradition and compromise overlooks the importance of respecting the original names of God in maintaining theological accuracy and honoring the Hebrew text. The reference answer from the teacher emphasizes this fundamental concern more effectively. The student should further enhance their understanding of the theological significance of using the original name of God in translations to improve their response."
