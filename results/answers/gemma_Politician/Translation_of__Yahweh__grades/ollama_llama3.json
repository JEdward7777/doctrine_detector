However, it does not directly address the concern about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices. While the response touches on the idea that \"LORD\" is a more universally recognized translation, it does not explicitly weigh the pros and cons of using traditional language versus being culturally sensitive.\n\nTo improve, the response could have more directly addressed the concern by discussing the balance between preserving the original name of God (Yahweh) and considering cultural sensitivities. Additionally, the response could have provided more specific biblical examples or theological underpinnings to support its claims. Nevertheless, the response provides some thoughtful reasons why churches might prefer \"LORD\" and shows a good understanding of the issue at hand."
