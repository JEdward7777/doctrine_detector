However, from a Christian perspective, it misses the opportunity to address the doctrinal differences between worshiping the one true God and worshiping false gods. In this context, a Christian worldview would prioritize doctrinal correctness over political correctness. Providing a brief explanation on the biblical teachings on this topic would have been more appropriate."
