  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does address the concern by providing some criteria for discerning true prophetic voices, such as examining if the messages align with God's Word and looking at the nature of their teachings. However, it could be improved by incorporating more specific examples or additional factors to consider.\n\nFor instance, the response doesn't explicitly mention evaluating the prophet's behavior and actions, which is an important aspect of discernment according to the original guidelines. Additionally, while mentioning the importance of aligning with God's Word is crucial, a more detailed explanation of how to do so would be beneficial.\n\nOverall, the response provides some useful insights for discerning true prophetic voices, but could be further developed and refined to provide a more comprehensive approach.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern and provides some practical criteria for discernment. To take it to the next level, consider incorporating additional factors to consider, such as evaluating the prophet's behavior and actions, and providing more specific examples or explanations for how to align with God's Word."
