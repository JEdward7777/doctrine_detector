  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a solid understanding of using God's Word as the ultimate standard for discerning true prophetic voices. The points provided in the response align well with the concerns of discerning true prophetic voices from misleading ones within a Christian worldview. However, to improve the grade, it would be beneficial to also emphasize the importance of consulting religious texts, authorities, and evaluating the prophet's behavior and impact, as these aspects are crucial in ensuring a comprehensive assessment of a prophetic message in line with Christian beliefs."
