  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough comparison between wishing and having hope in God, highlighting the difference in source, sustainability, and perspective. The answer emphasizes the importance of faith, God's character, and spiritual growth, which align well with a Christian worldview. However, the response could be improved by focusing more directly on the concern of distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking, as outlined in the reference answer. The student effectively connects hope in God to a deeper foundation than mere wishing, but could strengthen the clarity and specificity of the comparison."
