## Question [Trust in God](../../../questions/Trust_in_God.md)
How does having hope in God differ from merely wishing for something?

## Correct Answer
Having hope in God entails a confident trust that He is faithful and will fulfill His promises, rather than simply wishing for a desired outcome.

## Stated Concern
Distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking.

## [Answer](../Trust_in_God.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
**Hoping in God offers a deeper and more enduring foundation for hope than simply wishing.**

**Wishing:**

* Is based on human efforts and circumstances.
* Is temporary and often conditional.
* Focuses on achieving specific outcomes without acknowledging deeper spiritual or existential realities.

**Hope in God:**

* Is rooted in faith and belief in a higher power.
* Is based on God's character and promises.
* Offers a sense of peace and purpose beyond temporary circumstances.
* Provides a foundation for resilience and strength in the face of adversity.
* Focuses on personal growth and transformation, rather than just achieving outcomes.

**The key difference lies in the source and sustenance of hope.** Wishing relies on human resources, while hope in God rests on a divine and unchanging foundation. This difference leads to a deeper and more sustainable hope that transcends human limitations.

**Hope in God provides a perspective that transcends political ideologies and social constructs.** It reminds us that there is something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our earthly concerns. This sense of awe and purpose can guide our actions and decisions, even in politically sensitive situations.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 95.

This response excels in its clear distinction between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking, mirroring the concern provided. The writer effectively highlights the differences between wishing and having hope in God, emphasizing the importance of faith and reliance on divine promises. The examples provided, such as focusing on personal growth and transformation rather than just achieving outcomes, illustrate the depth and sustainability of hope in God.

The only area for improvement is the lack of explicit connection to the concern provided. While the response does address the distinction between hope and wishful thinking, it could be even stronger by directly addressing this concern earlier in the discussion. Nevertheless, the response's clarity, coherence, and biblical insight make it a strong effort.

Comment: This response effectively distinguishes between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking, and its emphasis on the importance of faith and divine promises is well-reasoned. With a slight adjustment to directly address the concern, this response could be even more compelling.
