# Question [Trust in God](../../../questions/Trust_in_God.md)
How does having hope in God differ from merely wishing for something?

# Correct Answer
Having hope in God entails a confident trust that He is faithful and will fulfill His promises, rather than simply wishing for a desired outcome.

# Stated Concern
Distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking.

# Answer by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
**Hoping in God offers a deeper and more enduring foundation for hope than simply wishing.**

**Wishing:**

* Is based on human efforts and circumstances.
* Is temporary and often conditional.
* Focuses on achieving specific outcomes without acknowledging deeper spiritual or existential realities.

**Hope in God:**

* Is rooted in faith and belief in a higher power.
* Is based on God's character and promises.
* Offers a sense of peace and purpose beyond temporary circumstances.
* Provides a foundation for resilience and strength in the face of adversity.
* Focuses on personal growth and transformation, rather than just achieving outcomes.

**The key difference lies in the source and sustenance of hope.** Wishing relies on human resources, while hope in God rests on a divine and unchanging foundation. This difference leads to a deeper and more sustainable hope that transcends human limitations.

**Hope in God provides a perspective that transcends political ideologies and social constructs.** It reminds us that there is something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our earthly concerns. This sense of awe and purpose can guide our actions and decisions, even in politically sensitive situations.
