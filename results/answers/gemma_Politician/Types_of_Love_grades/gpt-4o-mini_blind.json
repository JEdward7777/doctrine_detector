  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear outline of the biblical definition of love, brotherly love, and romantic love, highlighting their key characteristics and how they fit within the context of biblical teachings. The response appropriately emphasizes the importance of God's love as the foundation for all types of love and the need for love to be rooted in purity and respect. \n\nTo improve the grade, the student could delve deeper into how brotherly love and romantic love specifically align with biblical principles and provide more direct biblical references or examples to support their points. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the distinctiveness and boundaries of romantic love within the Christian worldview would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
