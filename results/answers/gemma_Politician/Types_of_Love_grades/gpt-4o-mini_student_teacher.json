They effectively differentiated between the two forms of love while ensuring that they align with a biblical worldview. The response also emphasized the importance of respect and inclusivity when discussing different forms of love, which is commendable. The student could improve by directly referencing specific biblical passages or teachings that relate to brotherly love and romantic love to strengthen the connection to a Christian worldview."
