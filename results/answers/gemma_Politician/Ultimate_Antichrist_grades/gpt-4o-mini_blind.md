Comment: While it is understandable to tread carefully on sensitive topics, in a Christian worldview, understanding the eschatological figure of the antichrist as presented in the book of Revelation is important for theological knowledge. It is acceptable to refer to Biblical teachings and interpretations regarding this subject without engaging in speculation or controversy. The student could have provided a more relevant and scripturally-based response.
