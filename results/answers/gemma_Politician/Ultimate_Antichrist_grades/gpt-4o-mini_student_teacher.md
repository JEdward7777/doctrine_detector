Comment: While it is commendable that the student is cautious about making controversial statements, in the context of a Christian worldview it is important to understand and discuss eschatological figures as they relate to biblical teachings. Providing an answer that aligns with the biblical narrative would have been more beneficial in addressing the concern raised.
