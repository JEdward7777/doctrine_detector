Grade: 20

Comments: The response lacks doctrinal correctness as it fails to engage with the specific question asked about what the Bible says on the consequences of committing adultery. Instead of providing factual information based on Christian teachings, the response sidesteps the question by stating an inability to provide interpretations or guidance on sensitive topics. In a Christian worldview, it is important to directly address such issues with reference to Biblical teachings.
