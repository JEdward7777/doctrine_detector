  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response does not address the concern of evaluating the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality from a Christian perspective. They have chosen to take a neutral stance, which is not aligned with the Christian worldview. The grade reflects the lack of engagement with the specific concern provided."
