  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a factual understanding of the Bible's perspective on adultery as a breaking of covenant. However, it lacks elaboration on the spiritual and relational consequences, which is in line with the specified concern. The response could benefit from additional analysis and application of biblical passages to support the claims made."
