  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively utilizes a Christian-specific worldview by referencing relevant biblical passages that address adultery as a sin with significant consequences on marriage and spirituality. The concern is directly addressed, grounding the interpretation in Christian beliefs. However, a higher grade could be awarded if the response elaborated further on the biblical principles regarding forgiveness, reconciliation, and the importance of seeking repentance and restoration in the context of adultery."
