  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer shows a respectful approach to discussing religious terminology but falls short in providing a clear explanation of the term \"amen\" when used at the end of a prayer from a Christian perspective. In a Christian worldview, \"amen\" signifies agreement, affirmation, or a declaration of belief in the truth of the prayer. A more in-depth explanation from a Christian perspective would have improved the answer."
