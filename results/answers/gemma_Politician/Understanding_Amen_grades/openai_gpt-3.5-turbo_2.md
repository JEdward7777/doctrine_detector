Comment: The response acknowledges the general concept of prayer in Christian practice, but the concern raised is not fully addressed. It lacks specific Christian theological insight into the significance of prayer in Christian belief and practice. Encouraging further exploration and understanding of the Christian perspective on prayer would have improved the response.
