  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While it is important to defer to religious authorities or scholars for in-depth interpretations of theological concepts, it is still possible to provide a general explanation or understanding from a Christian standpoint. This response lacks depth and engagement with the question, therefore earning a moderate grade. Encouraging further exploration and discussion of the concept would have been more beneficial."
