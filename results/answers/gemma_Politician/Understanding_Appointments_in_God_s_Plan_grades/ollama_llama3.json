  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response does not directly address the concern about divine selection and grace in salvation, but it does provide a biblical concept related to being \"appointed to eternal life\" which can be seen as relevant to the concern. The response also reflects a correct understanding of God's sovereignty and grace. However, the response could have been more directly applicable to the concern by explicitly discussing divine selection and grace in the context of salvation.\n\nComment: A good effort, but not fully addressing the concern."
