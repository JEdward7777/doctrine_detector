## Grade by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
95.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
I would grade this response as 95.

The answer correctly and concisely explains the concept of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation from a Christian worldview. It emphasizes the idea of being chosen by God for eternal life based on His sovereign will and grace. It aligns well with Christian beliefs regarding predestination and election. The deductive points are clear, relevant, and directly address the concern raised.

The slight deduction from the perfect score is due to the initial response that deflected the question without providing an explanation. While it is acknowledged that seeking interpretations from religious authorities is often appropriate, the response could have still attempted to address the query in a general sense before recommending further study from experts.
