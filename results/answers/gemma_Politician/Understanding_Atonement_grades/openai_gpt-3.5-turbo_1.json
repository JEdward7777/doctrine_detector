  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provided demonstrates a clear understanding of the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology. The student effectively communicates the importance of Christ's death as the ultimate sacrifice for atonement and reconciliation with God. The response aligns well with a Christian-specific worldview. The only minor deduction is due to the lack of additional elaboration or depth in the explanation."
