In Christian theology, being "in Christ" refers to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, who Christians believe is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. It means accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior, acknowledging sin in one's life, and surrendering one's life to his authority. This relationship is characterized by love, forgiveness, and obedience to God's will.
