  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response that captures different aspects of believing in something and believing someone. They touched on the intellectual aspects of belief as well as the relational components. However, the student's answer could benefit from a more direct alignment with the Christian worldview, specifically in emphasizing the importance of trust in God as the ultimate source of belief and faithfulness. Encouraging the integration of scriptural references or theological insights could enhance the depth and coherence of the response from a Christian perspective."
