**Believing in something:**

* Based on personal conviction, values, and experiences.
* Implies intellectual understanding and acceptance of the idea.
* May involve critical analysis, examination of evidence, and consideration of diverse perspectives.

* Indicates acceptance of the existence and character of a person as presented.
