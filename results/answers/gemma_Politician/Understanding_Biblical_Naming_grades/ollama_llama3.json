  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response accurately reflects the literal meaning of the biblical text, which is essential for proper biblical interpretation. It also acknowledges the significance of names in scripture, recognizing that names often carry theological and cultural connotations. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more depth and insight into the biblical concept of naming, such as exploring how names reveal character or reflect God's purposes.\n\nThe concern about understanding proper biblical interpretation is well-addressed, but the response could delve deeper into the significance of names in scripture, such as discussing how names can shape identity or reveal God's character. Overall, a solid effort that could be improved with more exploration and analysis."
