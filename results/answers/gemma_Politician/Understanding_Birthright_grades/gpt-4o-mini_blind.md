Grade: 20

Comment: The response completely misses the mark by ignoring the question and failing to engage with the Biblical context. It is important to understand and analyze religious events according to the beliefs and teachings presented in the Bible. In this case, Esau's decision to sell his birthright had significant spiritual and familial implications, which should have been addressed in the response.
