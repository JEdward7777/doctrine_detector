Grade: 85

Comment: The response correctly identifies the significance of choices and their spiritual consequences within a Christian context by exploring the story of Esau and Jacob from a Christian worldview perspective. However, the initial response given by the student lacks an integration of religious perspectives and fails to engage with the question's emphasis on the spiritual consequences of choices.
