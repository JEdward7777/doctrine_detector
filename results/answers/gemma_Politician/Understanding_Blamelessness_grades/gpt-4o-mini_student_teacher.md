Comment: While it is understandable that the student may lack expertise in religious or theological interpretations, it is also important to be able to engage with the specific concern raised in this case. The student could have acknowledged the distinction between being blameless and sinless even without providing a specific interpretation, by simply stating that being blameless before God does not mean being completely without sin. Striving to incorporate a Christian worldview in addressing concerns related to biblical references is crucial in this context.
