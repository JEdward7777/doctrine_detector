Comment: The response appropriately addresses the concern by explaining the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context. It provides a clear and insightful explanation, demonstrating a good understanding of the Christian perspective on the concept. The only minor deduction is for not directly engaging with the question of interpretation, as the response could have delved deeper into the nuanced theological aspects of the concept of being blameless before God.
