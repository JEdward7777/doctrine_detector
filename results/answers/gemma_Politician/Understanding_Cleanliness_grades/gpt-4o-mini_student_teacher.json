  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-organized and thoughtful exploration of how the Biblical definitions of \"clean\" and \"unclean\" can inform our understanding of moral purity in a modern context. They address the importance of personal integrity, social responsibility, and inclusivity, which align well with Christian values. The inclusion of considerations for political discourse and public health measures shows a comprehensive understanding of the topic. However, the student's answer could have further emphasized the symbolic nature of clean and unclean as illustrating moral purity, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
