  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively engages with the given answer by expanding on the spiritual and moral significance of cleanliness in a Biblical context. The discussion of maintaining personal integrity, social responsibility, inclusivity, and avoiding stereotypes aligns well with a Christian worldview. The points made are thoughtful and address the concern provided. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the ultimate importance of spiritual cleanliness as a reflection of one's relationship with God."
