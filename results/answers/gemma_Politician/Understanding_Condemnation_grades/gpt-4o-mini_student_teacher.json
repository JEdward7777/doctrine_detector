  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thoughtful analysis of 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16, emphasizing God's forgiveness and grace. However, the answer misses the core Christian teaching that condemnation is a judgment for wrongdoing but through Christ, believers are freed from condemnation. The student's focus on inclusivity and compassion is commendable but the primary theme of condemnation and grace in the Christian life wasn't fully addressed in relation to the provided biblical verses."
