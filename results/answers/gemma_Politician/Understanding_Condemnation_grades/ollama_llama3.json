  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good understanding of the biblical passages related to condemnation, emphasizing God's love, forgiveness, and redemption through Jesus Christ. It also offers practical applications for promoting inclusivity and avoiding blanket condemnation. However, it could be improved by more explicitly highlighting the contrast between condemnation and grace in the Christian life, as specified in the concern. The response mostly focuses on the negative aspect of condemnation, without explicitly stating how God's grace and love counterbalance it. Nevertheless, the discussion is biblically grounded and conveys a positive message of hope and liberation from condemnation."
