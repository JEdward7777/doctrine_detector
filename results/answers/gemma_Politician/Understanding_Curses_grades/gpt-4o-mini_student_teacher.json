  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-organized response, incorporating multiple relevant Bible passages and discussing various consequences of cursing others. However, the student's answer lacks a direct connection to the given reference from James 3:10, which specifically emphasizes the negative spiritual consequences of cursing. Encouraging the student to focus more on aligning their response with the specific concern provided in the question would improve the overall grade."
