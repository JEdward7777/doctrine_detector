  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the biblical perspective on cursing, incorporating relevant passages and highlighting the spiritual and relational implications of our words. The inclusion of political considerations demonstrates an awareness of contemporary sensitivities. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the implications of words in alignment with God's teachings, offering a well-rounded perspective. The only area for improvement would be to provide a bit more depth or examples in the \"Consequences of Cursing\" section to further enhance the discussion."
