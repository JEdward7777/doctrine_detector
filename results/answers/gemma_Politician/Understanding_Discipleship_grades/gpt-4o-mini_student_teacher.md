Comment: While the student acknowledged the lack of provided text in the prompt and therefore couldn't give a direct answer from a specific context, they missed the opportunity to provide a general definition of being a disciple of Jesus based on the Christian worldview. In the future, it would be beneficial for the student to offer a relevant definition even without a specific text reference.
