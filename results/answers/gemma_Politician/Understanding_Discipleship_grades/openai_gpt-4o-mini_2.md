Comment: The response clearly articulates a solid understanding of being a disciple of Jesus by emphasizing belief, obedience, and following His example. The only reason for deducting a few points is the lack of specific references to biblical teachings on discipleship, which could have further strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
