  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response effectively explains the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment as related to the concern provided. It acknowledges the perfect righteousness and justice of God's judgment compared to the flawed and biased nature of human judgment. The response also emphasizes God's response to sin including both punishment and a call to repentance, which aligns with a Christian worldview. However, the response could strengthen the discussion by providing more direct connections to specific Bible verses that support the points made and deepen the scriptural foundation of the explanation."
