  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 20/100. \n\nThe student's response completely avoids engaging with the question and lacks depth in addressing the concept of divine nature from a Christian worldview. While it is important to provide factual information, in this case, understanding the student's reluctance to delve into subjective interpretations or theological discussions, it is also necessary to apply a Christian perspective when discussing God's nature. This response fails to address the concern of understanding God's nature for developing a personal relationship and living according to His will, which is crucial in a Christian context."
