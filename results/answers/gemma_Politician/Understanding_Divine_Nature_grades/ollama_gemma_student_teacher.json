  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response accurately conveys the theological concept of the divine nature as the inherent attributes and qualities that define God. However, it lacks elaboration on the specific characteristics mentioned in the reference answer, such as holiness, love, justice, and power. A more comprehensive explanation would have elaborated on these attributes and their significance in understanding God's nature."
