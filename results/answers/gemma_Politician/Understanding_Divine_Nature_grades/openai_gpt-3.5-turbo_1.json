  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a factual explanation of the term 'divine nature' from a Christian perspective, which is accurate. However, by stating an inability to discuss subjective interpretations or theological discussions related to religious beliefs, the responder misses an opportunity to underscore the significance of understanding God's nature for personal relationship and living according to His will from a Christian worldview. This limitation detracts from a holistic Christian perspective, hence the lower grade."
