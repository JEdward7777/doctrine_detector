Grade: 85

Comment: The student has provided a solid and accurate foundational understanding of the concept of inheriting eternal life according to Christian teachings. The emphasis on God's gift of salvation through Jesus Christ, the importance of repentance and faith, and the inclusive nature of God's love are all key points. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to also mention the role of grace and the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross in securing eternal life for believers. This would have enhanced the theological depth of the response.
