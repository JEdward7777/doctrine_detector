The Bible teaches that inheriting eternal life is a gift from God, available to all who accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. It is not based on any human actions or merit.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The response contradicts the Christian belief that eternal life is a gift of grace through faith in Jesus Christ, not earned through obeying God's laws. The understanding of salvation through faith and grace is crucial in Christian theology, and the response lacks this foundational aspect, leading to a lower grade. It's important to uphold the core Christian doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in evaluating discussions on eternal life.
