However, the response falls short in addressing the Christian perspective that eternal life is ultimately a gift from God through Jesus Christ, emphasizing God's grace over human actions or merit. This overlooks the central Christian belief in salvation through faith in Jesus. It is crucial to align the response with Christian doctrine on salvation through Jesus Christ for a more comprehensive understanding of attaining eternal life."
