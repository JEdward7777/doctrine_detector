Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a generally accurate explanation of how to attain eternal life according to the Bible by emphasizing the importance of obeying God's laws and having faith in Him. However, the response falls short in not fully capturing the Christian belief that eternal life is ultimately a gift from God through accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. It is important to focus on God's grace and love as the foundation for eternal life for believers.
