  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the definition of a fool in relation to belief and obedience to God, but it lacks clarity and fails to provide specific biblical references or theological insights. While it correctly states that a fool does not believe in God and often disobeys him, it does not elaborate on other aspects of the biblical definition of a fool as outlined in the reference answer."
