  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a comprehensive overview of how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles affected their relationships in the early church. The analysis is well-structured and covers various aspects such as initial suspicion, gradual acceptance, cultural barriers, reconciliation, and recognition of shared humanity. The student effectively discusses key figures like Paul of Tarsus and emphasizes the church's message of inclusivity through Christ's love. However, to enhance the answer, more specific biblical references or doctrinal insights could have been included to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective. Overall, a solid exploration of the topic with room for deeper theological engagement."
