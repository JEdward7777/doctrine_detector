## [Answer](../Understanding_Gentiles_in_Scripture.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
**The perception of Gentiles among early Israelites did indeed influence their relationships with them.** While there were variations in attitude and practice among different Jewish communities and individuals, some general observations can be made:

**1. Initial suspicion and hostility:**
- Early Israelites harbored suspicions and hostility towards Gentiles due to their distinct religious beliefs, practices, and cultural customs.
- Many early Christians were Jewish converts, and their acceptance of the Gentile Christ challenged traditional Jewish beliefs and practices.

**2. Gradual acceptance:**
- As the early church grew and interacted with Gentile communities, some Israelites began to recognize the validity of Gentile faith and practices.
- Early church leaders like Paul of Tarsus played a significant role in promoting inclusivity and challenging Jewish exclusivity.

**3. Cultural and social barriers:**
- Cultural and social barriers persisted between Israelites and Gentiles.
- Many early Christians faced persecution from their Jewish communities, who saw Christianity as a threat to their religious and cultural identity.

**4. Reconciliation and coexistence:**
- Over time, reconciliation and coexistence between Israelites and Gentiles grew.
- The development of Christianity led to the transformation of both cultures, fostering greater understanding and acceptance between them.

**5. Recognition of shared humanity:**
- Early Christians recognized the shared humanity of all people, regardless of their ethnicity or background.
- This recognition challenged the traditional Jewish-Gentile divide and opened the way for greater interfaith dialogue and cooperation.

**Factors mitigating potential offense:**

- The early church emphasized the universality of Christ's salvation, which transcended cultural and ethnic boundaries.
- Early Christians were mindful of the potential for offense among their Jewish audiences and often used careful language to avoid compromising their faith.

**Conclusion:**

The perception of Gentiles among early Israelites influenced their relationships with them, but over time, reconciliation and coexistence emerged as key aspects of early Christianity. The church's emphasis on the universality of Christ's love and its recognition of shared humanity played a significant role in mitigating potential offense and fostering greater inclusivity.
