  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While it is important to be respectful of diverse beliefs and sensitivities, the student's response did not address the concern of understanding the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals as outlined in the reference answer. A grade of 50 is given for acknowledging the sensitivity of the topic, but missing the opportunity to provide a relevant interpretation from a Christian perspective."
