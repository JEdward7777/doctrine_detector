However, the initial reluctance to engage with potentially controversial or offensive interpretations of religious texts may hinder a deeper exploration of the topic from a Christian worldview. Engaging respectfully with diverse beliefs while upholding the truth of Christian doctrine is important in discussions about religious matters."
