70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical concept of being "called" by God in the context of faith. However, the response lacks elaboration and fails to address the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith as explicitly as desired.
