Being 'called' by God signifies that He has chosen and appointed us for His special purpose and work.

Understanding personal purpose in the context of faith.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided completely avoids engaging with the concept of being 'called' by God and does not address the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith. It is important to acknowledge and engage with religious beliefs and theological interpretations, especially when the context of faith is the focal point of discussion.
