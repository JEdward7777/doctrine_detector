Comment: The student provided a solid explanation of how Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men according to the Bible. They accurately highlighted Jesus' love, inclusivity, compassion, and challenge to societal norms. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to also mention Jesus' perfect obedience to God's will, his fulfillment of prophecies, and his sacrificial death on the cross as essential aspects of how Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men. Adding these points would have enhanced the completeness of the answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
