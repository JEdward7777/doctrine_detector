  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive comparison between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory, touching on important aspects such as the source, focus, motivation, duration, and impact. The student effectively highlighted the differences in a clear and organized manner. However, the answer could have been enhanced by emphasizing more on the unmatched value, worth, and majesty of God's glory compared to earthly glory, as described in the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the concept from a Christian perspective."
