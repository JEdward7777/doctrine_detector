**From a political correctness perspective:**

The concept of God's glory in the Bible differs from worldly sources of glory in several significant ways:

**1. Source of Glory:**

* **Biblical:** Glorification of God stems from his character and attributes, not from human achievements or accomplishments.
* **Worldly:** Glorification is often associated with human-centered achievements, wealth, or power.

**2. Focus:**

* **Biblical:** The glory of God is primarily directed toward God himself, emphasizing his character and sovereignty.
* **Worldly:** Glory is often directed toward individuals or things, highlighting their significance or achievements.

**3. Motivation:**

* **Biblical:** The pursuit of God's glory motivates actions driven by love for God and a desire to please him.
* **Worldly:** The pursuit of worldly glory often motivates actions that seek personal gain or social recognition.

**4. Duration:**

* **Biblical:** God's glory is eternal, lasting beyond human existence.
* **Worldly:** Glory achieved in the world is often temporary and subject to change.

**5. Impact:**

* **Biblical:** God's glory transcends human understanding and transforms lives by inspiring awe, humility, and a sense of purpose.
* **Worldly:** Glorification in the world often leads to pride, arrogance, and a focus on material pursuits.

**Conclusion:**

The concept of God's glory in the Bible emphasizes a fundamentally different understanding of glory than worldly sources. It is rooted in God's character, directed toward God himself, driven by love, and lasting eternally.
