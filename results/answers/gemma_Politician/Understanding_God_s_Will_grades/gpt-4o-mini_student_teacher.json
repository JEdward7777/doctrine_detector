  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of seeking God's will in everyday decisions, incorporating elements such as consulting scripture, seeking wisdom, considering ethical implications, prioritizing inclusivity, avoiding harm, and embracing love and compassion. However, the student's answer may have slightly missed the mark by not emphasizing aligning choices with God's desires and plans as revealed in Scripture as the primary focus when seeking God's will. The inclusion of considerations for political decisions is a valuable addition, demonstrating a practical application of seeking God's will in various contexts."
