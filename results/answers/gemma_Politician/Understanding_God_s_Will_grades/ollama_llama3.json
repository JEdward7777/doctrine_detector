  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good foundation by emphasizing the importance of understanding God's desires and plans for our lives, as revealed in Scripture. It also acknowledges that seeking God's will involves aligning our choices with what is pleasing to Him. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or practical applications of how to seek God's will.\n\nThe response does not explicitly address the concern about people struggling with making decisions that honor God or feeling uncertain about His direction for their lives. While it mentions understanding God's desires and plans, it does not provide guidance on how to overcome uncertainty or doubt in one's decision-making process.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good starting point but could be improved by providing more practical advice and addressing the concern about uncertainty in seeking God's will."
