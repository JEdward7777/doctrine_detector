## The Nature of God's Wrath:

**1. Fundamentally different:**

- Human anger stems from finite minds and limited knowledge.
- God's wrath rests on his perfect justice and holiness, driven by his love for righteousness.

- God's wrath is not simply about punishing people.
- It is about upholding justice and restoring balance to a world marred by sin.
- Simultaneously, God's love compels him to offer mercy and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.


**3. Targeted and Proportional:**

- God's wrath is not indiscriminate or uncontrolled.
- It is directed towards specific actions that violate his law and harm his creation.
- The intensity of God's wrath is proportional to the sin committed.


**4. Not driven by emotions:**

- God's wrath is not a spontaneous or emotional response.
- It is a calculated and deliberate action based on his perfect knowledge of what is right and wrong.


**5. Focused on redemption:**

- God's wrath ultimately points towards redemption.
- His punishment is intended to awaken people to their need for forgiveness and lead them to accept Jesus Christ as their savior.


**Biblical Examples:**

- God's wrath is seen in his judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18-19).
- God's wrath is mentioned in prophecies concerning the ultimate defeat of evil and the establishment of his kingdom (e.g., Revelation 6-20).
