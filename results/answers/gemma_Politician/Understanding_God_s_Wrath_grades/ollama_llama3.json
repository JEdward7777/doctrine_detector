  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately describes God's wrath as a righteous judgment of sin, in contrast to human anger, which aligns with the given answer. It also highlights that God's wrath is aimed at upholding justice and holiness, which addresses the concern about understanding God's wrath as a measured response to sin rather than an uncontrolled fit of rage.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are:\n\n1. The response does not explicitly state that God's wrath is proportional to the sin committed, which is mentioned in the given text under point 3.\n2. There is no explicit mention of redemption and forgiveness through Jesus Christ, although it is implicit in the discussion of God's wrath as a response to rebellion against God.\n\nOverall, the response provides a clear and accurate understanding of God's wrath, addressing the concern about its nature and significance. With some additional development on points 1 and 2, this could be an even stronger response."
