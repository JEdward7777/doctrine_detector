  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of grace in a Christian context, highlighting its aspects of unmerited favor, compassion, and transformation in believers' lives. The answer aligns well with the concept of God's unmerited favor as mentioned in the reference answer. However, there could have been a clearer emphasis on grace being freely given by God to sinful humanity without any merit on their part. Additional clarity on this point would have further enhanced the student's response."
