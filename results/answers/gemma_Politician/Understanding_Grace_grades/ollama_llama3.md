I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response effectively conveys the idea that grace is unmerited favor from God, which aligns with the concern to clarify the concept of God's unmerited favor. The use of phrases such as "freely bestowed and not earned" also accurately reflects the biblical notion that salvation is by God's grace alone, and not based on human merit.

The response could be improved by providing more specific examples or illustrations of how this concept plays out in a Christian's life, but overall, it provides a clear and concise explanation of the concept of grace.
