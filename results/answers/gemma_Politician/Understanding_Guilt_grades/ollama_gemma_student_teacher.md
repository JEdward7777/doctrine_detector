**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's response correctly states that to be guilty according to the Bible means to have disobeyed God. However, the response lacks elaboration or explanation of the biblical basis for this claim. Additionally, the response does not address the concern related to recognizing the need for repentance and forgiveness, which is relevant to the understanding of guilt in a Christian worldview.
