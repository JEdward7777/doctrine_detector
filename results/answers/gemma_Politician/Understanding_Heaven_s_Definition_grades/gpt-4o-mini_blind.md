## Question [Understanding Heaven's Definition](../../../questions/Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md)
What is the biblical definition of 'heaven' and how does it differ from 'sky'?

## Correct Answer
In the Bible, 'heaven' usually refers to where God lives, while 'sky' refers to the blue expanse above the earth. The term 'heavens' encompasses everything above the earth, including celestial bodies like the sun and stars.

## Stated Concern
It's essential to understand the different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture, as they can impact our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him.

Comment: The response lacks engagement with the question within the specified Christian worldview. In a context where discussing biblical definitions is required, it is important to make an attempt to engage with the question using the parameters provided. It would be more beneficial to at least attempt to address the biblical understanding of 'heaven' and differentiate it from the concept of 'sky' within a Christian perspective.
