  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response is inadequate as it fails to engage with the given question and concern about the biblical definition of 'heaven' and its distinction from 'sky'. As the concern emphasizes the importance of understanding these terms in the context of Scripture, the student missed an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge and critical thinking from a Christian worldview. Encouragement for future improvement in engaging with questions related to religious concepts is needed."
