  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical definitions of 'heaven' and 'sky' within a Christian worldview. They accurately explain that 'heaven' refers to the dwelling place of God, while 'sky' refers to the physical expanse above the earth. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of 'heavens' encompassing celestial bodies."
