However, the initial response's reluctance to engage with religious or theological concepts indicates a hesitancy that could limit a comprehensive understanding of how these terms impact our relationship with God. It would be beneficial to broaden the scope of knowledge in this area to fully grasp the implications on one's faith worldview."
