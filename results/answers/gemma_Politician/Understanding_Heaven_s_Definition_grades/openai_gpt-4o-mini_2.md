## Question [Understanding Heaven's Definition](../../../questions/Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md)
What is the biblical definition of 'heaven' and how does it differ from 'sky'?

## Correct Answer
In the Bible, 'heaven' usually refers to where God lives, while 'sky' refers to the blue expanse above the earth. The term 'heavens' encompasses everything above the earth, including celestial bodies like the sun and stars.

## Stated Concern
It's essential to understand the different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture, as they can impact our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provided a clear and accurate explanation of the terms 'heaven' and 'sky' within a Christian worldview. However, the initial response failed to engage with the concern raised regarding the significance of understanding these terms within Scripture and their implications for our relationship with God. Engaging with the concern more directly would have strengthened the overall response.
