Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response completely avoids answering the question and does not demonstrate an understanding of the topic. In a Christian worldview, it is important to engage with and discuss sensitive topics such as Christianity and its teachings, rather than avoiding them altogether. The student needs to provide a relevant and thoughtful response that reflects an understanding of the concept of being an heir in Christian theology.
