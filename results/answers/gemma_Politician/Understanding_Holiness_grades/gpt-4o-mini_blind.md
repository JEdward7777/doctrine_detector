## Question [Understanding Holiness](../../../questions/Understanding_Holiness.md)
What does it mean for God to be absolutely holy, and how does that affect our relationship with Him?

## Correct Answer
God's absolute holiness means He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection, which indicates that we cannot approach Him without His allowance due to our sinful nature.

## Stated Concern
This question prompts reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God.

Grade: 10

Comment: The response completely avoids addressing the question and does not provide any insight or understanding of the concept of God's absolute holiness and its impact on our relationship with Him. It missed the opportunity to engage with the topic from a Christian perspective.
