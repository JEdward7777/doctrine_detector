While it is understandable that they may not be comfortable or knowledgeable in discussing religious topics, in the context of this question and concern, their answer does not address the significance of God's holiness and its impact on our relationship with Him. A more relevant response would have at least attempted to relate the concept of holiness to the themes of ethical standards or personal conduct, even if from a secular perspective."
