  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the concept of God's absolute holiness, which aligns with the concern about our own holiness and approaching a holy God. However, it falls short in not directly addressing the concern or providing a clear connection between the concept of God's holiness and the necessary steps for approaching Him.\n\nAdditionally, while the response is respectful and acknowledges the limitations of its expertise, it does not engage deeply with the biblical understanding of our sinful nature and the need for divine allowance to approach God. A higher score would require a more explicit and biblically grounded exploration of these themes."
