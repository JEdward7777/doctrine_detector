  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a clear and accurate explanation of God's absolute holiness and the implication for approaching Him in light of our own sinful nature. The concern raised about reflecting on our holiness and how we approach God aligns well with the theological perspective presented in the response. The only drawback is that it did not extend further into the implications or applications of these theological truths, which could have enriched the response further."
