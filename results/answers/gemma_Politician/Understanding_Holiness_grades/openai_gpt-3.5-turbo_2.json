However, a Christian worldview would value the acknowledgment and discussion of God's holiness and humanity's sinfulness as crucial aspects of faith and understanding in approaching a holy God. This response could have acknowledged this without delving deeply into theological interpretations, which would have shown respect and awareness of the Christian perspective."
