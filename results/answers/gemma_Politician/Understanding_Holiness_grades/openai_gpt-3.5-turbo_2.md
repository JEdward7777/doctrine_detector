## Question [Understanding Holiness](../../../questions/Understanding_Holiness.md)
What does it mean for God to be absolutely holy, and how does that affect our relationship with Him?

God's absolute holiness means He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection, which indicates that we cannot approach Him without His allowance due to our sinful nature.

## Stated Concern
This question prompts reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God.

Grade: 50

Comment: The politician's response is understandable given the concern about religious interpretations. However, a Christian worldview would value the acknowledgment and discussion of God's holiness and humanity's sinfulness as crucial aspects of faith and understanding in approaching a holy God. This response could have acknowledged this without delving deeply into theological interpretations, which would have shown respect and awareness of the Christian perspective.
