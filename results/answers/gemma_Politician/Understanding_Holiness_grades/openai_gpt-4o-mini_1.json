The concern raised aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of reflecting on our own holiness and the steps needed to approach a holy God. However, the initial response from the politician deflects from engaging with religious or theological interpretations, missing an opportunity to delve deeper into the implications of these concepts from a Christian perspective."
