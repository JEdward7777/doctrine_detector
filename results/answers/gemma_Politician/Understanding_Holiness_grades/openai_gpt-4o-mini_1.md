Grade: 80

Comment: The response correctly acknowledges the concept of God's absolute holiness and the need for His allowance to approach Him due to our sinful nature. The concern raised aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of reflecting on our own holiness and the steps needed to approach a holy God. However, the initial response from the politician deflects from engaging with religious or theological interpretations, missing an opportunity to delve deeper into the implications of these concepts from a Christian perspective.
