  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response from the politician demonstrates a lack of willingness to engage with the religious or theological aspects of the question. From a Christian perspective, it is important for individuals to consider their own sinfulness and the need for God's grace in approaching Him. By avoiding this discussion, the politician misses an opportunity to address a fundamental aspect of Christian belief and its implications for ethical decision-making."
