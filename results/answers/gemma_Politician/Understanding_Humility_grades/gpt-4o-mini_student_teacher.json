  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive understanding of humility before God from a Christian perspective by emphasizing key aspects such as recognizing sinfulness, embracing God's sovereignty, serving others, and avoiding self-promotion. The biblical references cited support the explanation well. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the essential element of submitting one's will to God and acknowledging His greatness, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. This adjustment would align the response more closely with the core Christian principle of humility before God."
