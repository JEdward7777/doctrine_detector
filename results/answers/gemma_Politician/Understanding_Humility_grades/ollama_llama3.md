## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response accurately captures some essential aspects of humility before God, such as submitting one's will to God and recognizing His greatness. It also acknowledges human weaknesses and imperfections, which is an important aspect of humility. The reference to "recognizing His greatness" implies an understanding of God's sovereignty and power, which aligns with the Christian perspective.

However, the response does not fully capture the comprehensive nature of humility before God as presented in the original passage. For instance, it does not mention recognizing one's sinfulness or celebrating God's greatness, both of which are essential components of true humility according to the biblical passages provided. Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific examples and illustrations of what it means to live a life of humility before God.

Overall, while this response is a good start, it could be improved by further developing its understanding of humility in relation to one's relationship with God.
