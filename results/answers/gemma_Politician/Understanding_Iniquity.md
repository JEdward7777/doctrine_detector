**Biblical Distinction Between Iniquity, Sin, and Transgression:**

**1. Iniquity:**

* A violation of natural law or moral principles.
* Often refers to actions that are harmful to oneself or others.
* Can be unintentional or deliberate.


**2. Sin:**

* A deliberate violation of God's law or moral principles.
* Sin involves conscious violation of God's standards.
* It has spiritual consequences and requires forgiveness through Christ.


**3. Transgression:**

* A deliberate violation of God's law.
* Transgression is often used in a legal or judicial context to describe actions that violate a rule or law.
* It implies a conscious disregard for God's authority and standards.


**Key Differences:**

* **Intent:** Iniquity is not necessarily intentional, while both sin and transgression are deliberate violations.
* **Divine Consequence:** Sin has spiritual consequences, while iniquity and transgression may have both spiritual and worldly consequences.
* **Moral Basis:** Iniquity violates natural law or moral principles, while sin violates God's law. Transgression specifically violates God's law.
