  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression, encompassing the specific concern of recognizing the gravity of actions and seeking repentance. The discussion is thorough, well-supported with scriptural references, and aligns with a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the concern raised in the given concern section to further strengthen the connection between the explanation and its practical application in fostering repentance."
