It correctly emphasizes the purity and freedom from guilt of the accused in the eyes of God. However, for a higher grade, the answer could have provided more specific biblical references to support the explanation further. Additionally, mentioning the importance of forgiveness and grace in such situations could have enhanced the answer."
