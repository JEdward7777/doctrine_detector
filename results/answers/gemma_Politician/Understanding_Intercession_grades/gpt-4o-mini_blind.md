Comment: This response completely avoids addressing the question about the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession from a biblical standpoint. Understanding and discussing the teachings of the Bible should not be seen as a political statement, but rather a fundamental aspect of studying Christian beliefs. It is important for students to engage with the theological content of the question in a meaningful way.
