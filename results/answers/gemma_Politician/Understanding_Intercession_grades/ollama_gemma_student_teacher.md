**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** While the student's response correctly acknowledges that the Bible teaches about the Holy Spirit's role in intercession, it lacks elaboration and fails to address the concern of deepening understanding of the Holy Spirit's involvement in prayer and intercession. The response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific biblical passages or doctrines that elucidate the Holy Spirit's role in intercession.
