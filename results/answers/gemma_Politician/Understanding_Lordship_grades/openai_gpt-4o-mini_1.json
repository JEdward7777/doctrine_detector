  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately captures the significance of the term \"Lord\" in relation to Jesus and God, highlighting its association with ownership, authority, and indicating the divinity of Jesus as God. The additional information provided in the initial response about God's sovereignty and Jesus' lordship over human destiny complements the main point well. A well-rounded understanding of the term 'Lord' within a Christian worldview is demonstrated."
