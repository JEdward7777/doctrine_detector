However, it lacks depth in describing the biblical perspective of God's majesty and falls short in emphasizing the uniqueness and holiness of God's attributes according to Christian doctrine. A stronger focus on God's transcendence, holiness, and the awe-inspiring nature of His majesty would have improved the answer. Additionally, a clearer connection to scriptural references or theological insights would have strengthened the response."
