  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70/100.\n\nWhile the student was able to capture some aspects of the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character such as power, authority, and sovereignty, their answer lacked specificity and depth that align with a Christian worldview. Their mention of different cultural interpretations, while relevant in a broader context, may dilute the focus on God's attributes and sovereignty over creation as per the concern provided. The student could improve their response by explicitly connecting 'majesty' to God's role as the supreme King and emphasizing His greatness and splendor within a Christian framework."
