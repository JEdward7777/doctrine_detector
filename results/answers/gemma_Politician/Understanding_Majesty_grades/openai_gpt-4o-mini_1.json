It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting God's attributes and sovereignty over creation. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the importance of acknowledging differing interpretations and sensitivities based on cultures and beliefs, but overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview."
