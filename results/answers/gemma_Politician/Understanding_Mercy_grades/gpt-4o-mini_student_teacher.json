  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful list of ways to demonstrate mercy in daily life, aligning well with the concern of embodying God's merciful nature in interactions with others. The suggestions cover various aspects of mercy such as empathy, forgiveness, grace, selflessness, modeling God's mercy, promoting justice, and cultivating gratitude. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the practical application of these principles in daily interactions to truly reflect God's merciful nature. Additionally, the response could be more concise and direct in connecting each point to God's merciful nature, as exemplified in the reference answer. Overall, the student has shown a good understanding of how mercy can be lived out in daily life but could enhance the direct connection to God's mercy."
