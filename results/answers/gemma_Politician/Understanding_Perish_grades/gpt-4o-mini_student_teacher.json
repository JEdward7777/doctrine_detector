While it is understandable to acknowledge limitations in theological knowledge, the student could have at least attempted to apply the reference answer within the context of the concern, demonstrating some understanding or critical thinking in a Christian worldview. More effort to connect the reference answer to the implications of spiritual separation from God would have significantly improved the response."
