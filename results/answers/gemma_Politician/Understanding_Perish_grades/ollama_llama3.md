I would give this response a score of 50.

The response does not directly address the concern of exploring the implications of spiritual separation from God, but it does provide some relevant biblical insight by defining what it means to "perish" spiritually. However, the response is limited in its scope and does not delve deeper into the theological implications of this concept.
