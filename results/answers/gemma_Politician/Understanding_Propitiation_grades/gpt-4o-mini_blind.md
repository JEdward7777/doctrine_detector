Comment: While it's important to recognize the limits of personal expertise, it's also essential to acknowledge the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of propitiation within a Christian worldview. This answer does not address the question in a manner that aligns with a Christian-specific perspective. An appropriate response would have engaged with the theological implications and doctrinal understanding of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of propitiation.
