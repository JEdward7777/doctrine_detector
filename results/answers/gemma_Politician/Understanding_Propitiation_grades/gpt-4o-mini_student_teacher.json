While it is important to acknowledge the limitations in providing subjective interpretations, in this case, the student missed the opportunity to engage with the specific Christian concept of propitiation and how it relates to God's justice and mercy. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into understanding theological concepts from a Christian worldview would improve their response in this context."
