  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response accurately explains that Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath, providing a means for sinners to receive forgiveness and eternal life. However, the response lacks elaboration or theological depth. A more comprehensive understanding of propitiation would include references to biblical passages or theological concepts that support the claim."
