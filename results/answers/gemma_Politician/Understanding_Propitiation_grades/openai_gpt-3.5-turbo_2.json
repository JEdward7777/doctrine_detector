  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of propitiation in relation to God's justice and mercy from a Christian perspective. The concern is addressed effectively with a succinct explanation of how Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and mercy. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is the initial disclaimer, as incorporating some level of subjectivity or theological discussion is often necessary when discussing religious concepts like propitiation."
