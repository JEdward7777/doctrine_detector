Comment: The response completely avoids the question and does not engage with the topic at all. In a Christian perspective, it is important to understand and discuss theological concepts like the concept of 'remnant' in the Bible and their implications for believers. This answer does not fulfill the requirements of the question from a Christian worldview.
