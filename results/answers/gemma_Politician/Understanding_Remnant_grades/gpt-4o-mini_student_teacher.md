Grade: 50

Comment: The student provided a factual and neutral response as stated, however, in the context of a question that specifically involves interpreting a religious concept from the Bible, a Christian worldview would involve discussing faith and spiritual strength derived from the concept of 'remnant.' In this case, a deeper engagement with the question from a Christian perspective was necessary.
