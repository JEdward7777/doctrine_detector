  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided does not address the concern raised regarding understanding the source of strength during difficult times from a Christian-specific worldview. The response instead avoids engaging with the theological concept presented. In the context of the concern and the answer given, the response lacks depth and fails to offer a Christian perspective on how believers draw strength from God during trials."
