Grade: 50

Comment: The response falls short in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview as it does not delve into the source of strength being God's grace extended to those who remain faithful. It lacks the connection to how relying on God's grace can provide believers with the strength to endure trials and remain true to Him. A more explicit link to the Christian understanding of God's role in providing strength during difficult times would have improved the grade.
