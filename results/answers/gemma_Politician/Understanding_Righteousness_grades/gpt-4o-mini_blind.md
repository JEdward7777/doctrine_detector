Grade: 40

Comment: While it is important to approach discussions of faith with reverence and respect, this response misses the mark by not attempting to provide any insight into the concept of God being described as 'righteous' from a Christian worldview. The student could have at least attempted to explain the concept based on Christian teachings and doctrines.
