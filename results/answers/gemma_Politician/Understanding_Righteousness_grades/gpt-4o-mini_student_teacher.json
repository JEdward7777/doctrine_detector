  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response lacks depth and fails to engage with the concept of God's righteousness as outlined in the reference answer. A Christian worldview would emphasize understanding God's righteousness as integral to comprehending His justice and love, which the student failed to address. Encouragement to delve deeper into theological discussions and teachings would enhance the understanding of the topic."
