  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of understanding God's righteousness for appreciating His justice and love, aligning with a Christian worldview. The student accurately describes God's righteousness as encompassing absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love, which leads to the condemnation of sin. The only minor deduction is due to the initial response's avoidance of offering any interpretation or opinion when discussing God's nature, which could have been more confidently expressed within a Christian perspective."
