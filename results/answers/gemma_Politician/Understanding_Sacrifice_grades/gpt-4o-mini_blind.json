  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a basic explanation of the symbolic connection between Jesus as the \"Lamb of God\" and the sacrificial system in the Old Testament. However, the answer lacks depth and fails to emphasize the foundational Christian belief that Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross fulfills and supersedes the need for animal sacrifices as atonement for sin according to Christian doctrine. There is room for improvement in explaining the theological significance of Jesus as the ultimate and perfect sacrifice in relation to the Old Testament sacrificial system."
