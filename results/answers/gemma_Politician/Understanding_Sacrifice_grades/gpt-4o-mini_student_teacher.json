However, the student\u2019s answer lacked emphasis on Jesus as a perfect and unblemished sacrifice for sins, which is a crucial aspect of why Jesus is referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to the Old Testament sacrifices. The answer could have been strengthened by highlighting the sacrificial atonement aspect more clearly."
