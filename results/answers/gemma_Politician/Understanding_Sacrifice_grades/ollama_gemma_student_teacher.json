  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the symbolic and theological significance of Jesus being referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to the sacrifices of the Old Testament. The student correctly points out that the comparison is symbolic and that Jesus' sacrifice is greater and more significant than any previous sacrifices. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct explanation of how Jesus' sacrifice is analogous to the sacrifices of perfect lambs commanded in the Old Testament."
