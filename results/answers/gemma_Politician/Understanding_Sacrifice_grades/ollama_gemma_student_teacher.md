## Question [Understanding Sacrifice](../../../questions/Understanding_Sacrifice.md)
Why is Jesus referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament?

## Correct Answer
Jesus is called the 'Lamb of God' because he was a perfect and unblemished sacrifice who paid for people's sins, analogous to the sacrifices of perfect lambs commanded in the Old Testament.

## Stated Concern
This question aims to help Christians understand the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Sacrifice.md) by [gemma Politician](../../../answering_models/gemma_Politician.md)
The reference to Jesus as the "Lamb of God" in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament is a symbolic and theological interpretation of Scripture. It is not intended to suggest that Jesus literally fulfilled the physical sacrifices of the Old Testament.

The comparison between Jesus and the sacrificial lambs in the Old Testament highlights the idea that Jesus' sacrifice is greater and more significant than any previous sacrifices. Just as the lamb was seen as a symbol of forgiveness and redemption in the Old Testament, Jesus is believed to be the ultimate sacrifice that offers salvation and forgiveness to all who believe in him.

**Grade: 80/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the symbolic and theological significance of Jesus being referred to as the "Lamb of God" in relation to the sacrifices of the Old Testament. The student correctly points out that the comparison is symbolic and that Jesus' sacrifice is greater and more significant than any previous sacrifices. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct explanation of how Jesus' sacrifice is analogous to the sacrifices of perfect lambs commanded in the Old Testament.
