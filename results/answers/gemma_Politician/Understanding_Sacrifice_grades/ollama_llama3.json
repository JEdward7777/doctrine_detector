However, it does not fully capture the depth of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption.\n\nThe given answer focuses more on Jesus being a perfect and unblemished sacrifice, which is a crucial aspect of his sacrificial work. The response also correctly notes that Jesus' sacrifice is greater and more significant than any previous sacrifices, but it does not adequately explain how this relates to God's plan for redemption.\n\nTo fully address the concern, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Jesus being called the \"Lamb of God\" and explored how his sacrificial role fulfills God's plan for redemption."
