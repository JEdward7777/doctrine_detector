It addresses the concern effectively by emphasizing Jesus as the perfect and unblemished sacrifice. The only suggestion for improvement would be to possibly include a reference to Jesus being the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the sacrificial system for a deeper theological connection."
