Comment: While it is important to be sensitive when discussing religious or cultural topics, in this case, the avoidance of discussing the meaning of a specific term within the context of the Old Testament limits the depth of understanding that could be achieved. It is important to be able to engage with and learn about different religious concepts in an academically rigorous manner, even if one does not personally adhere to those beliefs.
