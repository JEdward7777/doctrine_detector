  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThis response does provide some information about the term 'Shaddai' and its usage in the Old Testament, which partially addresses the concern of understanding God's nature and attributes as revealed in Scripture. However, it does not directly relate to the concern or go beyond simply defining the term. The response is brief and lacks depth, leaving much room for further exploration and explanation.\n\nThe concern specifically calls for an understanding of God's nature and attributes as revealed in Scripture, but this response primarily focuses on etymological information about the term 'Shaddai'. While the two may be related, they are distinct topics. To receive a higher grade, the response would need to more directly address the concern and provide a more substantial discussion about the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture."
