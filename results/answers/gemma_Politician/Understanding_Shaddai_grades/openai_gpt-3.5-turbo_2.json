  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term 'Shaddai' in relation to the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. The concern is adequately addressed, although there could have been more depth in discussing how the term 'Shaddai' relates to God's power and sovereignty. The initial refusal to discuss religious terminology was unnecessary in this context but does not detract significantly from the overall quality of the response."
