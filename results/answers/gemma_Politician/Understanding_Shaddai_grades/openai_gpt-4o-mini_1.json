However, the initial statement about avoiding specific religious terminology due to potential offensiveness or controversy goes against the purpose of providing a comprehensive and accurate explanation from a Christian worldview perspective. It is important to engage with and understand religious terminology within the context of faith and belief systems, rather than avoiding them altogether."
