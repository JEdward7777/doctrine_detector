Comment: The response provides some information about the term 'Shaddai' and its possible meaning, which is relevant to understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. However, the initial statement about avoiding specific religious terminology due to potential offensiveness or controversy goes against the purpose of providing a comprehensive and accurate explanation from a Christian worldview perspective. It is important to engage with and understand religious terminology within the context of faith and belief systems, rather than avoiding them altogether.
