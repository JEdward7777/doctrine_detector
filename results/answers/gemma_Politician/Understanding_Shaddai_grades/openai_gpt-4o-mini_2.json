The information aligns well with understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. However, deducting a few points for not directly linking the information to a Christian specific worldview and for not delving deeper into the theological implications of the term 'Shaddai' in the context of God's character and power as revealed in the Bible."
