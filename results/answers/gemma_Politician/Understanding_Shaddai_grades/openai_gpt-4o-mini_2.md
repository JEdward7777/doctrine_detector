Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the term 'Shaddai' and its significance in the Hebrew language and Old Testament. The information aligns well with understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. However, deducting a few points for not directly linking the information to a Christian specific worldview and for not delving deeper into the theological implications of the term 'Shaddai' in the context of God's character and power as revealed in the Bible.
