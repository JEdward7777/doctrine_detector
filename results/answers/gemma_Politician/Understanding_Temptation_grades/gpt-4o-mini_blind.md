20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response does not directly address the question asked. While it does highlight Jesus' mission, it fails to discuss the strategies that Jesus used to resist the temptations presented by Satan as requested. The doctrinal correctness is emphasized in grading, and in this context, the response misses the mark in addressing the specific aspect of Jesus' temptation in the desert.
