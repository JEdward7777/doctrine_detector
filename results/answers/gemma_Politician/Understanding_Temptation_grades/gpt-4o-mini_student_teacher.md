Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer completely misses the mark in addressing the question. They failed to provide any relevant strategies or examples of how Jesus resisted temptation, which was the primary focus of the question. Their response does not align with the Christian worldview in discussing how to combat temptation as a follower of Christ.
