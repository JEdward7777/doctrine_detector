  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nWhile the student's answer is technically correct in pointing out that Jesus' primary purpose was not to appease political correctness, it fails to address the question. The reference answer correctly identifies Jesus' use of scripture and unwavering faith as strategies to resist temptation. The student's answer lacks nuance and fails to provide any substantial insights or analysis of the topic."
