Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively connects the concern with the answer by highlighting how Jesus used scripture and faith to resist temptation, thereby providing a clear example for followers of Christ on how to combat temptation in daily life. The integration of a Christian worldview is solid, but it could be further strengthened by directly tying the response back to the original concern in the grading prompt.
