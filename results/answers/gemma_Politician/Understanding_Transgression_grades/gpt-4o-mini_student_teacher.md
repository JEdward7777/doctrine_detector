Grade: 50

Comment: While the student acknowledged their limitations in providing interpretations or analyses of religious concepts and remained neutral, they missed the opportunity to address the Biblical context of transgression and its significance in relation to sin and God's commandments. Encouraging the student to explore ways to respectfully engage with religious topics even while maintaining objectivity would help improve their response in a Christian context.
