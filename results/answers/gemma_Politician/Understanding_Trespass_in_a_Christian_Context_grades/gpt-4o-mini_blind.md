Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response lacks engagement with the question asked, therefore earning a low grade. In a Christian worldview, it is important to be able to make connections and articulate how religious concepts relate to one another, such as the concept of trespass and sin. Encouraging exploration and understanding of these connections is key in a theological discussion.
