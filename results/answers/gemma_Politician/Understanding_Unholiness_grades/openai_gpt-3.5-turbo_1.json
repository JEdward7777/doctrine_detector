It aligns well with the concern of encouraging self-examination and awareness of the impact of unholiness on personal and communal behavior. The deductive points are in line with Christian teachings and emphasize the importance of honoring God's standards. The deduct is due to the first response not fully embracing the Christian perspective on the concept of holiness and the need to acknowledge objective moral standards based on biblical truths."
