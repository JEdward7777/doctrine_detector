It aligns well with the concern by promoting self-examination and awareness of the influence of unholiness on personal and communal behavior. The deduction from a perfect score is due to the initial response's avoidance of addressing the core Christian principle of living in alignment with God's will and the potential harm of not recognizing behaviors that go against His standards."
