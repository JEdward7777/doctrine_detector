  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60%\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant information about the meaning of the term \"worldly\", but it falls short in explicitly highlighting the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, which is the concern being addressed. While the answer does mention evil values and behaviors, it doesn't directly connect these concepts to the idea of a contrast between worldly and godly principles. Additionally, the response could benefit from more biblical support or examples to illustrate this contrast."
