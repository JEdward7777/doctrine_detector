Comment: The response effectively explains the term "worldly" within the context of contrasting worldly values with godly principles. The answer aligns well with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the distinction between the corrupt values of the world and the righteous principles of God. The only room for improvement would be to perhaps provide a bit more depth or biblical references to further support the explanation.
