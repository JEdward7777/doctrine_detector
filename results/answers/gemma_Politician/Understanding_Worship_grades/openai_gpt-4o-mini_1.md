Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides a decent definition of worship in general terms but lacks depth and specific reference to the Christian perspective. Incorporating key Christian beliefs such as worship as a reflection of love, devotion, and reverence for God would strengthen the answer. Additionally, connecting worship to key Christian practices like prayer, singing hymns, and partaking in communion would have enhanced the response.
