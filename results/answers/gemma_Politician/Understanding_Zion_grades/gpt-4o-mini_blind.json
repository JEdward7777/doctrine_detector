The answer provided does not address the question at all and avoids engaging with the theological significance of the term 'Daughter of Zion' for the people of Israel. It would be more appropriate to provide an explanation from a Christian perspective, considering its meaning in the Bible and its relevance to understanding the relationship between God and Israel."
