Comment: While it is important to respect diverse perspectives and identities, in the context of discussing Biblical terms and metaphors, it is crucial to provide an analysis based on a Christian worldview. This answer does not engage with the question within the context of the Bible and misses the opportunity to explore the deeper spiritual implications of the term 'Daughter of Zion' for God's relationship with His people.
