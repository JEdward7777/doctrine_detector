  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: The student's response does not address the concern of understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death within a Christian worldview. They state their inability to provide interpretations or theological insights, which is a missed opportunity to engage with the question using a Christian-specific perspective. More effort could have been made to discuss the biblical understanding of Sheol and Hades in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous."
