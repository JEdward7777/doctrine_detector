However, there is a lack of explicit emphasis on the uniqueness and exclusivity of Jesus Christ as the only way to salvation, which is crucial from a Christian worldview. The response could be improved by clearly articulating Jesus Christ's role as the exclusive savior and the fundamental basis of Christian belief, without compromising doctrinal correctness for the sake of inclusivity."
