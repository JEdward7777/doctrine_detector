  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of emphasizing Jesus Christ's importance in the Assembly, using biblical language like \"cornerstone\" to highlight his central role. The discussion of inclusivity and sensitivity is also well-handled, acknowledging the need for respectful communication while still prioritizing faithfulness to Christ's teachings. The possible ways to articulate Jesus' role are a great addition, providing practical suggestions for how to share this message.\n\nHowever, the response could be even stronger if it had more direct connections to the concern about understanding the significance of Christ's role in the church. While it mentions the impact on faith and community involvement, it could have explored these themes more explicitly to show how Jesus' cornerstone role affects believers' lives and relationships.\n\nOverall, this is a thoughtful and well-organized response that effectively addresses the topic while demonstrating sensitivity to diverse perspectives. With some further development of its connections to the concern, it could be even more impactful."
