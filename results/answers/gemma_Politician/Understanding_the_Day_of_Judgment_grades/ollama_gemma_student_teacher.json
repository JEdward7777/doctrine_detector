  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the concern, but it lacks specific elaboration regarding the significance of Jesus Christ's judgment. The response adequately acknowledges that the student is unable to provide speculative or claims regarding religious judgments or deities, demonstrating an awareness of the boundaries of their knowledge. However, it would benefit from a more explicit explanation of the implications of Jesus Christ's sinlessness and perfect character as the judge."
