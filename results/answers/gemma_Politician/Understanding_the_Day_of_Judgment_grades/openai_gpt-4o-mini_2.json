However, the initial response provided seems to avoid engaging with the Christian worldview presented in the concern. While it is understandable to respect boundaries around discussing religious judgments and deities, in this specific case related to Jesus Christ as the judge, a more direct engagement with the Christian perspective would have been beneficial."
