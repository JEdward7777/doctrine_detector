They also acknowledge that it symbolized a sacred space where God's presence was believed to dwell. \n\nThe answer could have been improved by also mentioning that in the New Testament, the term \"house of God\" is also used metaphorically to refer to the Church or the body of believers as the dwelling place of God through the Holy Spirit. By including this additional information, the response would have been more comprehensive and nuanced."
