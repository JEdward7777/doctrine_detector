  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student accurately identifies the term \"house of God\" as relating to a physical temple or sanctuary where worship occurs and God's presence is believed to dwell. However, the student could have elaborated more on the significance of this concept within Scripture, such as its role in the Old Testament sacrificial system and the foreshadowing of Christ as the ultimate dwelling place of God. This oversight prevents a higher score."
