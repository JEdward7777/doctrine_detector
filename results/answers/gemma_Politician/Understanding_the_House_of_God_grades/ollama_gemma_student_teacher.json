  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the primary function of the \"house of God\" as a physical temple or sanctuary for religious practices. However, it lacks additional elaboration on the symbolic significance or broader theological implications of such a space in biblical context. Including references or examples from Scripture would further strengthen the response."
