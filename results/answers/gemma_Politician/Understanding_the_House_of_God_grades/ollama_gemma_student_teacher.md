**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the primary function of the "house of God" as a physical temple or sanctuary for religious practices. However, it lacks additional elaboration on the symbolic significance or broader theological implications of such a space in biblical context. Including references or examples from Scripture would further strengthen the response.
