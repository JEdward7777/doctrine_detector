  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately identifies that the \"house of God\" refers to a physical temple or sanctuary, which aligns with the biblical context. It also correctly notes that it symbolizes a sacred space where God's presence is believed to dwell, which adds depth to the understanding. However, the response could be improved by providing more specificity and clarity on the significance and meaning of \"house of God\" in Scripture.\n\nThe concern was to clarify the significance and meaning of \"house of God\" in Scripture, but the response only scratched the surface. While it provided some insight into the physical location and symbolic significance, it did not fully address the concern. Therefore, I deducted points for not thoroughly addressing the concern.\n\nOverall, a good effort, but could be improved with more development and specificity to better address the concern."
