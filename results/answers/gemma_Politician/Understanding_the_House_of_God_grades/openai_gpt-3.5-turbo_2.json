  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the term \"house of God\" in Scripture, specifically mentioning the tabernacle or the temple as places where God is worshiped. The response could have been further enhanced by incorporating a bit more depth or Scriptural references, but overall it effectively addresses the concern raised."
