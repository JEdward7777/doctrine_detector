**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** The student's response acknowledges the limitations of their knowledge and avoids making definitive theological claims. However, they provide a somewhat superficial understanding of the characteristics that reflect the image of God, focusing primarily on physical and mental attributes. The response would benefit from a deeper exploration of the spiritual and moral dimensions of human nature as reflected in the biblical definition.
