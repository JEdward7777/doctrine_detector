  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a decent explanation of the various interpretations of the term \"kingdom of God\" in the New Testament. However, the student's answer lacked a clear emphasis on God's sovereignty and authority in our lives, which was the specified concern. The student could have tied in the concept of God's rule over individuals and creation more explicitly to fulfill the given concern from a Christian worldview."
