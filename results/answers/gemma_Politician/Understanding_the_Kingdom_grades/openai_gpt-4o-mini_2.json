However, the concern raised in the response regarding the sensitivity surrounding religious terminology could potentially lead to diluting the Christian worldview by suggesting multiple interpretations without affirming the central message. It is important to maintain a clear understanding of Biblical truths while also respecting diversity of beliefs."
