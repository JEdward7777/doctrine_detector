Comment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of the 'last days' within the Christian faith, linking it to Jesus' first and second comings and the final day of judgment. It aligns well with Christian beliefs and the importance of understanding major Biblical events for Christian faith. The slight deduction in points is due to the initial response of not providing interpretations or speculations related to religious prophecies, which could have been further elaborated upon within a Christian worldview context.
