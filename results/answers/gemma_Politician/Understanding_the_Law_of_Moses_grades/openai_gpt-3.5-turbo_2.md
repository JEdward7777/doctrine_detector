Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the Old Testament laws, specifically the Law of Moses, by mentioning the content and purpose of these laws for the Israelites. However, the concern on the relevance of these laws today was not directly addressed in the response. It would have been beneficial to provide some insight on how these laws may still hold relevance or significance for Christians today.
