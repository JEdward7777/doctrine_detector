However, in the context of understanding the significance of God's name in the Old Testament, it is essential to provide a brief and neutral explanation, focusing on the meaning rather than promoting a specific belief. Encouraging a general understanding of the term 'Yahweh' as God's personal name could have been a more inclusive approach in the given context."
