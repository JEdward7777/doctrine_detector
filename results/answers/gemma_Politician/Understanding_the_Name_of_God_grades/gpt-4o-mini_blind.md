Comment: While it is important to acknowledge personal limitations in knowledge and expertise, in a setting where understanding religious and theological concepts is essential, it is crucial to at least attempt to provide a basic explanation or offer resources for further exploration. In this case, a simple acknowledgment of the name 'Yahweh' as the personal name of God in the Old Testament would have sufficed. Striving to engage with the question to some extent, even with limited knowledge, is part of the learning process.
