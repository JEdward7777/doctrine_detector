Comment: The student's response does not engage with the question or provide a meaningful answer. It is important to respect diverse beliefs, but within the context of a Christian worldview, it is necessary to discuss the biblical narrative and continuity of salvation history. The student missed the opportunity to explore the significance of judges in the Old Testament as foreshadowing Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior in the New Testament.
