However, it could be improved by providing more explicit examples or illustrations that demonstrate this continuity throughout the biblical narrative. Additionally, while respecting diverse beliefs and interpretations is important, the response could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of how the different figures in the biblical narrative contribute to our understanding of salvation."
