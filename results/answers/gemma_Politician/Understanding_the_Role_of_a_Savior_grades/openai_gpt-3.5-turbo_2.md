Comment: The response effectively connects the Old Testament judges to the concept of salvation through Jesus Christ, demonstrating a clear understanding of the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation from the Old Testament to the New Testament. The only minor concern is the potential for further elaboration on how the Old Testament judges specifically foreshadowed Jesus Christ as the ultimate deliverer.
