Grade: 10

Comment: The response completely avoided addressing the question and did not engage with the topic at all. It failed to demonstrate any understanding or analysis related to the differentiation between human spirit and evil spirit as outlined in the Bible. The student should have at least attempted to explain the differences, even if they were not providing a theological interpretation.
