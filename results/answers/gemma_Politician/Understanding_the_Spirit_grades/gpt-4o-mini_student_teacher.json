  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student clearly states their limitation in providing interpretations or insights on religious texts, which is understandable. However, the question specifically asked for a differentiation between the human spirit and evil spirits according to the Bible. The student's response does not address the concern at all and does not engage with the given reference answer. It is important to try to address the specific aspects of the question even when there are personal limitations in discussing religious concepts."
