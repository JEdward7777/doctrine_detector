  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does attempt to provide some clarity on the distinction between personal spiritual identity (human spirit) and malevolent spiritual influences (evil spirit), which aligns with the concern. However, it's a fairly brief and superficial treatment of the topic. The language is straightforward, but there's no depth or nuance in exploring the implications of these concepts.\n\nA higher score might be possible if the response delved deeper into biblical passages and theological frameworks that support this distinction, or if it offered practical applications for understanding and interacting with malevolent spiritual influences. As it stands, the response feels more like a cursory summary rather than a thoughtful exploration of the topic."
