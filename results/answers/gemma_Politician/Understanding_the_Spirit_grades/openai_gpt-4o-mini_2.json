  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear distinction between personal spiritual identity as presented in the Bible and malevolent spiritual influences. It accurately explains how the human spirit reflects character and emotional states, while evil spirits are non-physical beings that oppose God. However, the grade could be higher if the response had elaborated further on how individuals can protect themselves from malevolent spiritual influences through personal spiritual practices in alignment with biblical teachings."
