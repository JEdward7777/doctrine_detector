## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the purpose of the tabernacle, but lacks specific details or elaboration on its significance in the Israelites' relationship with God. It avoids controversy by explicitly stating that it cannot provide interpretations or assumptions regarding religious events. While this approach is commendable for maintaining neutrality, it could have elaborated more on the symbolic and spiritual significance of the tabernacle within the Israelites' faith.
