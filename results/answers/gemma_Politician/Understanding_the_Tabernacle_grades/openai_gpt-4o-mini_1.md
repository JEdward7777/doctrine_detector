## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The original response correctly acknowledges the purpose of the tabernacle as a special dwelling place for worshiping God according to detailed instructions given by God. However, the concern was about understanding the role of the tabernacle in the Israelites' relationship with God, and the response failed to address this aspect fully. The grade reflects the accuracy of the response but deducts points for not fully addressing the specific concern within a Christian worldview.
