While it is correct that the title signifies Jesus' humanity and connection to people, it is essential to also emphasize the divine aspect of this title. In Christian doctrine, the title \"Son of Man\" is closely linked to Daniel 7:13-14 where it denotes a figure with divine authority and power who will rule over all nations. This aspect of Jesus' identity as the Son of Man is crucial to understanding his role as both fully human and fully divine, and his mission of redemption and salvation for humanity. Encouraging the student to explore this theological depth would enhance the response."
