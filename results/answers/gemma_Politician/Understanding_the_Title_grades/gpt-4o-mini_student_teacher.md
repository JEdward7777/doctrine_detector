Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a somewhat insightful answer regarding Jesus' humility and connection to humanity through the title "Son of Man." However, the importance of Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, as well as His role as the Messiah, were not adequately addressed. Encouraging the student to further explore the divinity aspect of Jesus' identity in relation to the title 'Son of Man' would enhance their understanding of its significance in the Christian faith.
