## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 85.

The original response touches on some important aspects of Jesus' identity as the "Son of Man", such as his connection to humanity, compassion, and desire to bridge the gap between the divine and human. However, it falls short in fully exploring the dual nature of Jesus as both fully human and fully divine, which is a crucial aspect of understanding this title.

The provided answer takes a more comprehensive approach by highlighting Jesus' dual nature, which shows a deeper understanding of the significance of the "Son of Man" title. This response also explicitly mentions Jesus' role as the Messiah, which is an important implication of this title.

To improve, the original response could have delved deeper into the implications of Jesus' dual nature and its connection to his Messianic role. Additionally, providing specific biblical examples or references would have strengthened the argument even further.

Comment: While the original response shows a good starting point in exploring the significance of the "Son of Man" title, it could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' dual nature and its implications for our faith.
