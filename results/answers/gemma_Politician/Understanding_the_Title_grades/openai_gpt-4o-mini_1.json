  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' in emphasizing His dual nature as fully human and fully divine, and His role as the Messiah. It effectively addresses the concern by clearly articulating the connection between this title and implications for our faith within a Christian worldview. The response could have further elaborated on the specific biblical references and historical context surrounding the title 'Son of Man' to strengthen the explanation. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful response."
