70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical context and the consequences of unfaithfulness in Israel's worship practices. However, it lacks specific examples or textual references to support the claim. Additionally, the student appropriately avoids making generalizations or stereotypes about entire groups of people based on their religious backgrounds.
