Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response lacks engagement with the question from a Christian perspective. In a context where understanding spiritual consequences is essential, the student's explanation falls short of addressing the concern provided. Strive to incorporate a Christian worldview when discussing divine consequences in this context.
