Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response does not address the concern of exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament. In a Christian worldview context, it is important to engage with theological topics when discussing biblical terms like 'Holy One'. The student should strive to incorporate relevant religious and theological insights in their responses.
