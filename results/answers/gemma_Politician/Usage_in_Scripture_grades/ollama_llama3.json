  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 20.\n\nThe reason for the low score is that while the original concern was to explore the authority and divinity of Jesus in the New Testament, the provided response only tangentially relates to this concern by mentioning Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament. The response primarily focuses on providing general information about the phrase \"Holy One\" without delving deeper into Jesus' authority and divinity.\n\nThe original answer about the Old Testament's use of the phrase \"Holy One of Israel\" is also not directly relevant to the concern, as it does not specifically address Jesus' authority and divinity in the New Testament. Therefore, while the response may have some superficial connections to the concern, it does not adequately engage with the specified topic.\n\nTo improve the score, the response could be revised to more explicitly connect Jesus' authority and divinity in the New Testament to his divine nature as the \"Holy One.\""
