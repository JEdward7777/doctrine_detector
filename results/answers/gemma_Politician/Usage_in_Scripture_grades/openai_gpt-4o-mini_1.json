It effectively addresses the concern raised regarding exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus in a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of direct reference to the Old Testament context of the term \"Holy One,\" which could have provided a more comprehensive understanding of this concept within Christian theology."
