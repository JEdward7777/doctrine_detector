Grade: 95

Comment: The response accurately connects the term "Holy One" in the New Testament specifically to Jesus, highlighting his authority and divinity as depicted in the New Testament. It effectively addresses the concern raised regarding exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus in a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of direct reference to the Old Testament context of the term "Holy One," which could have provided a more comprehensive understanding of this concept within Christian theology.
