Comment: This response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament. It acknowledges Jesus as the "Holy One" in the New Testament, providing a specific theological perspective while remaining respectful and informative. The only slight deduction is for not delving deeper into the theological implications of Jesus being referred to as the "Holy One."
