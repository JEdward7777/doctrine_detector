  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a generally accurate overview of the likely uses of myrrh in biblical burial practices. They correctly mention its use as an aromatic unguent for preserving the body. However, it would have been beneficial for them to emphasize myrrh's significance in the specific context of biblical times, connecting it to the cultural and religious beliefs of that era. Additionally, they could have mentioned that myrrh was one of the gifts brought to Jesus at his birth, symbolizing his eventual sacrifice and burial. More depth and specificity would have improved the grade."
