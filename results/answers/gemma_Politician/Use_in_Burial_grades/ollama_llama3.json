  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 90.\n\nThe response accurately identifies myrrh as being used in burial practices, which aligns with the concern of recognizing cultural contexts in scripture. The mention of anointing and respect for the deceased also adds depth to the understanding of myrrh's significance. While it does not explicitly state the biblical context, the mention of its use in religious ceremonies hints at its importance in ancient cultures.\n\nThe only deduction from a perfect score is that the response could be more explicit in drawing connections between myrrh's use and biblical teachings. However, overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the cultural significance of myrrh and its relevance to biblical burial practices.\n\nComment: To take it to the next level, consider explicitly highlighting how myrrh's use in ancient cultures reflects the hope and resurrection themes found in scripture. This would further solidify the connection between myrrh's cultural context and biblical teachings."
