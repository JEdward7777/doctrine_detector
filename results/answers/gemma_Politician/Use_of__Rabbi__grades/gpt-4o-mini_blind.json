While it is accurate that John the Baptist and Jesus were not commonly referred to as \"Rabbi\" in historical records, Jesus is indeed recognized as a Rabbi in the New Testament scriptures. John the Baptist, on the other hand, was more known as a prophet rather than a Rabbi. This response would have been improved by acknowledging Jesus' identification as a Rabbi in the biblical context."
