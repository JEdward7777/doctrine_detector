Grade: 50

Comments: The student's response is partially correct. While it is accurate that John the Baptist and Jesus were not commonly referred to as "Rabbi" in historical records, Jesus is indeed recognized as a Rabbi in the New Testament scriptures. John the Baptist, on the other hand, was more known as a prophet rather than a Rabbi. This response would have been improved by acknowledging Jesus' identification as a Rabbi in the biblical context.
