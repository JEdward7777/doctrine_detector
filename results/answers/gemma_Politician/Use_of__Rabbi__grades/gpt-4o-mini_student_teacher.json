  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student correctly identified that historical accuracy is important when discussing figures in Christian history. However, the student's answer failed to acknowledge the specific information that John the Baptist and Jesus were indeed referred to as \"Rabbi\" by their disciples, showing their authoritative teaching roles. Moving forward, it is important to balance historical accuracy with the key teachings and roles of figures within a Christian worldview."
