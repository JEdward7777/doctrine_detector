70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 
The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the historical context and textual evidence regarding the title "Rabbi." However, it lacks nuance and fails to acknowledge the perspective of the teacher's reference concerning the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings.
