50.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: The response accurately addresses the concern by acknowledging that both John the Baptist and Jesus were referred to as 'Rabbi' by their disciples, indicating their roles as teachers. However, the grade is reduced because there is no explicit recognition of the divine authority and respect associated with Jesus' teachings from a Christian worldview. It is important to consider and emphasize Jesus' unique and divine authority as the Son of God in this context.
