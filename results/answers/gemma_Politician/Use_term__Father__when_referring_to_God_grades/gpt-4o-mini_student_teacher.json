  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough analysis of the issue at hand, considering various perspectives and potential alternatives. However, the student leans more towards avoiding the term 'Father' due to potential triggering or offensive connotations, rather than affirming the importance of the term in upholding traditional theological understanding. The student does not explicitly address the concern raised about avoiding theological inaccuracies and diluting the scriptural message. While the considerations and suggestions provided show sensitivity and empathy, the student's response lacks a strong endorsement of using the term 'Father' with appropriate teaching and context clarification."
