  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding the use of gendered language when referring to God. They thoughtfully weigh the traditional theological significance of \"Father\" against its potential to exclude or alienate individuals who identify outside traditional religious frameworks. \n\nThe inclusion of potential alternatives and emphasis on context and empathy further strengthens their argument. While the student ultimately concludes that the use of \"Father\" is necessary, they acknowledge the need for clarity and sensitivity in its application.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from greater engagement with the provided concern. The student's final sentence suggests a balance between inclusivity and theological integrity, but a more explicit connection to the concern would strengthen the overall argument."
