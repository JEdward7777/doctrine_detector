## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student's answer is dismissive and lacks engagement with the question. While it is valid to acknowledge limitations in knowledge, the student missed an opportunity to engage with the significance of the kingdom of God in conveying the parables used by Jesus. Encouraging further exploration and reflection on the importance of these parables would have been more appropriate.
