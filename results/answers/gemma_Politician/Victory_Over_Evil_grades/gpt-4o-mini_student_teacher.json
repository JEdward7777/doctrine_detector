  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely misses the mark by refusing to engage with the question from a Christian perspective. In a Christian worldview, understanding and discussing God's promises, like the defeat of Satan through the Messiah, are essential. The student's answer lacks the necessary understanding of the question and the Christian perspective, hence the low grade."
