**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the biblical promise of the Messiah defeating Satan. However, it lacks additional elaboration or theological depth. The response could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of this promise within Christian theology and its relevance to the sovereignty of God.
