Comment: The response provided does not address the concern raised regarding the implications of Christ's victory for believers and their spiritual life. It dismisses the opportunity to explore the significance of Jesus' death and resurrection within a Christian worldview, which is a key aspect of understanding the faith and its impact on believers. It lacks depth and insight from a Christian perspective.
