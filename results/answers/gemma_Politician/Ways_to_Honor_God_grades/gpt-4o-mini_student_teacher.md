Grade: 70

Comment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of practical ways Christians can honor God in their daily lives, addressing various aspects of faith and worship. However, there is a notable divergence from the reference answer in terms of emphasis. While the student's response covers a wide range of actionable expressions of faith, it could benefit from a clearer focus on the core elements of thanking, praising, obeying God's commandments, and showcasing His greatness as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. The inclusion of cultural sensitivity, social issues, and social media usage is commendable but slightly detracts from the central theme. Strengthening the connection to the core elements of honoring God would enhance the response.
