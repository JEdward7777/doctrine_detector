Comment: This answer completely avoids addressing the question with regard to the Christian worldview. As an LLM model, it is important to provide relevant information based on a Christian perspective when asked about the term 'word of God' according to the Bible. In this case, the response lacks doctrinal correctness and does not align with the requirements of the question.
