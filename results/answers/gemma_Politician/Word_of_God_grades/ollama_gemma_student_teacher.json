  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 70/100\n\n**Comment:** While the student correctly avoids bias and factual errors, their response lacks depth and fails to address the concern regarding the scope and significance of God's communication to humanity. A more thorough response would elaborate on the various ways the Bible describes the Word of God, including its connection to both written texts and the incarnate person of Jesus Christ."
