## Grade by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
## Grade: 70/100

**Comment:** While the student correctly avoids bias and factual errors, their response lacks depth and fails to address the concern regarding the scope and significance of God's communication to humanity. A more thorough response would elaborate on the various ways the Bible describes the Word of God, including its connection to both written texts and the incarnate person of Jesus Christ.
