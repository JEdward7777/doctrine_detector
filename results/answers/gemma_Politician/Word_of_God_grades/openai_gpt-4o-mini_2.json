  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided a clear and accurate description of the term 'word of God' within a Christian worldview, addressing the concern regarding the scope and significance of God's communication to humanity. The graded response, however, fails to align with a Christian perspective by avoiding interpretations or theological information related to religious concepts. In a Christian worldview, understanding and sharing theological insights on God's communication are essential components, which were lacking in the given answer."
