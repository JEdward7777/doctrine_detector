  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 50.\n\nWhile it is important to respect religious beliefs and uphold decency, the student's answer does not directly address the question asked nor the specified concern about prioritizing devotion to God. The student missed an opportunity to provide a thoughtful response grounded in a Christian worldview that addresses the question of modern idols that Christians might worship. Encouraging respectful dialogue and providing a relevant answer would have been more appropriate in this context."
