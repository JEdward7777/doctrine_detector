## Grade: 70

**Comment:** The student's response adequately addresses the concern by highlighting the potential for idolatry in various aspects of life. However, it lacks nuance and fails to elaborate on specific examples or provide a comprehensive analysis of potential idolatrous practices within the modern world. Additionally, while respecting religious faith is important, the response could have benefited from providing a clearer explanation of why promoting harmful or blasphemous ideologies is inappropriate.
