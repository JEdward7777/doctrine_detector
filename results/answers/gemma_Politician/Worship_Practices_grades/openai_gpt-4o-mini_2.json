  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern from a Christian perspective by highlighting the importance of not prioritizing worldly idols over one's relationship with God. The attempted response acknowledges the Christian worldview of prioritizing devotion to God above all else. However, the grade is slightly lowered due to the initial response's vague language and lack of depth in directly addressing the specific concern."
