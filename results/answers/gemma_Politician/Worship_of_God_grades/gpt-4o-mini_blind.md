Comment: While it is important to respect the personal beliefs of individuals, this response does not address the question from a Christian worldview. It lacks doctrinal correctness and does not provide any insight into why people are created to worship God or what the Bible says about false gods. In a Christian context, it would be beneficial to engage with the theological perspective on these topics.
