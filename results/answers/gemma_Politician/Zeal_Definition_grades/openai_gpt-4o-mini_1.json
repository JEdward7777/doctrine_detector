The focus on actively living out one's faith aligns well with Christian principles. However, in a Christian worldview, it is crucial to also consider the biblical context of zeal for proper application in a believer's life, which was not explicitly addressed in the response. So, while the response is insightful, it could be enhanced by incorporating more emphasis on the biblical foundations of zeal."
