  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a fairly comprehensive overview of the significance of Mount Zion in relation to King David, acknowledging the biblical narrative and the importance of the location in David's reign. However, the student could have emphasized more the direct Biblical account of King David capturing Mount Zion from the Jebusites and its connection to Jerusalem. The answer could have been strengthened by clearly articulating the biblical account without diluting it with references to diverse perspectives and ongoing debates."
