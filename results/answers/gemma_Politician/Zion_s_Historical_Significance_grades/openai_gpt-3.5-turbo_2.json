The response effectively addresses the concern by recognizing the association of Mount Zion with Jerusalem and the City of David in connection to key figures in Scripture. However, it could have further emphasized the spiritual and theological significance of Mount Zion in the Christian faith, reflecting on its symbolism and role in the larger narrative of God's relationship with His people."
