Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer is vague and does not address the question directly in terms of the significance of the atonement lid in the context of the ark of the covenant. A Christian worldview recognizes the importance of understanding and discussing religious concepts, even if they may be perceived as controversial. The student should have at least attempted to provide a basic explanation within the context of the Old Testament symbolism of God's mercy and atonement.
