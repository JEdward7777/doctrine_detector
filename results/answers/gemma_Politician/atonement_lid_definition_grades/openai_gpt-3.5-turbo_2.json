The explanation is rooted in a Christian worldview, highlighting the theological understanding of God's mercy in redeeming mankind through the role of the high priest. However, the respondent's initial refusal to discuss sensitive or controversial religious topics could limit the depth of their engagement with this subject matter. It is essential to approach the study and discussion of religious beliefs with openness and sensitivity, allowing for a deeper exploration of theological concepts."
