  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament by explaining the significance of the atonement lid (mercy seat) in relation to God's mercy in redeeming sinful humanity. The answer demonstrates a foundational knowledge of Christian theology and the Old Testament sacrificial system. However, the grade is not 100 due to the lack of depth or further explanation on how this symbolism points to Christ's ultimate sacrifice in the New Testament, which would have enriched the answer."
