  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing how cultural context and power dynamics influenced access to sacred spaces in various cultures. However, the response fails to address the concern of recognizing the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him from a Christian worldview. The central focus on social hierarchy and cultural practices detracts from the specific Christian perspective required for this question."
