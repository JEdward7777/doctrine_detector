It aligns well with the Christian worldview's understanding of recognizing the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him. The examples given effectively illustrate the importance of maintaining sanctity and upholding social hierarchy in ancient religious practices. The response could be strengthened by explicitly connecting these cultural practices to the biblical concept of the high priest entering the 'most holy place' to represent the people before God."
