  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive understanding of how cultural context and power dynamics influenced access to sacred spaces, reflecting the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him. It effectively expands on the concept of restrictions in sacred spaces beyond just the example given, demonstrating a strong grasp of the significance of maintaining sanctity and social hierarchy. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the unique role of the high priest in representing the people before God, tying it more explicitly to the acknowledgment of God's holiness and the reverence required in approaching Him."
