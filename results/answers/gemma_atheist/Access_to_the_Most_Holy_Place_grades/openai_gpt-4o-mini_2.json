  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive understanding of how cultural context and power dynamics influenced access to sacred spaces, aligning with the concern of recognizing the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him. It effectively elaborates on the importance of restrictions for preserving sanctity, maintaining social hierarchy, and enhancing spiritual experience. The examples provided further support the explanation. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the given answer about the high priest with the broader context discussed in the response to deepen the analysis."
