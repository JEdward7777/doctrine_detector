## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The biblical account of the Israelites being commanded to celebrate Passover every year is a religious belief and does not reflect historical or archaeological evidence. As an atheist scholar, I do not subscribe to religious doctrines or historical narratives as presented in religious texts.

The celebration of Passover is a cultural and religious tradition that holds significance within Judaism and other religious communities. Its origins and significance should be understood within the context of their religious beliefs and practices, rather than as historical facts verified by secular sources.</end_of_turn>
