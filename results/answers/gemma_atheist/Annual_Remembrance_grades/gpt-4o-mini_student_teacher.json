  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 50.\n\nWhile the student acknowledges the significance of the celebration of Passover within Judaism and other religious communities, their response completely dismisses the biblical account as a religious belief without considering the possibility of its spiritual or symbolic importance. As a Christian, recognizing the importance of remembrance in faith is crucial, and understanding Passover as a commemoration of God's victory and deliverance is essential in shaping one's worldview. The student's perspective lacks an exploration of the deeper spiritual truths that may underlie the command to celebrate Passover every year."
