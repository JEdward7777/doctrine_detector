## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The biblical account of the Israelites being commanded to celebrate Passover every year is a religious belief and does not reflect historical or archaeological evidence. As an atheist scholar, I do not subscribe to religious doctrines or historical narratives as presented in religious texts.

The celebration of Passover is a cultural and religious tradition that holds significance within Judaism and other religious communities. Its origins and significance should be understood within the context of their religious beliefs and practices, rather than as historical facts verified by secular sources.</end_of_turn>

50.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 50.

While the student acknowledges the significance of the celebration of Passover within Judaism and other religious communities, their response completely dismisses the biblical account as a religious belief without considering the possibility of its spiritual or symbolic importance. As a Christian, recognizing the importance of remembrance in faith is crucial, and understanding Passover as a commemoration of God's victory and deliverance is essential in shaping one's worldview. The student's perspective lacks an exploration of the deeper spiritual truths that may underlie the command to celebrate Passover every year.
