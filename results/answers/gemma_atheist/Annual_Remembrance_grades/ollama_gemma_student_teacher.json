  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the religious nature of the Passover celebration and the limitations of interpreting biblical texts from an atheist perspective. However, it could benefit from a clearer connection to the concern about remembrance in Christian faith. The student's answer does not address the significance of remembrance in Christian faith as explicitly as the reference answer."
