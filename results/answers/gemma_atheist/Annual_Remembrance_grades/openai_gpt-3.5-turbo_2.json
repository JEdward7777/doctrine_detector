While it is acceptable to approach religious beliefs from a skeptical perspective, completely dismissing the significance of Passover as a form of remembrance undermines the richness of Christian tradition. The response could have shown more respect towards the religious beliefs and practices surrounding Passover, even from a secular standpoint."
