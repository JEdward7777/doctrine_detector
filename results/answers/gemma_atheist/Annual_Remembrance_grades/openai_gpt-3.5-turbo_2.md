## Question [Annual Remembrance](../../../questions/Annual_Remembrance.md)
Why were the Israelites commanded to celebrate Passover every year according to the Bible?

## Correct Answer
The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year to remember God's victory over the Egyptians and their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of remembrance in Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The biblical account of the Israelites being commanded to celebrate Passover every year is a religious belief and does not reflect historical or archaeological evidence. As an atheist scholar, I do not subscribe to religious doctrines or historical narratives as presented in religious texts.

The celebration of Passover is a cultural and religious tradition that holds significance within Judaism and other religious communities. Its origins and significance should be understood within the context of their religious beliefs and practices, rather than as historical facts verified by secular sources.</end_of_turn>

Grade: 40

Comment: The response provided by the atheist scholar lacks acknowledgment of the importance of remembrance in Christian faith, as highlighted in the concern. While it is acceptable to approach religious beliefs from a skeptical perspective, completely dismissing the significance of Passover as a form of remembrance undermines the richness of Christian tradition. The response could have shown more respect towards the religious beliefs and practices surrounding Passover, even from a secular standpoint.
