The points mentioned align well with Christian doctrine regarding the empowerment, transformation, supernatural experiences, activation of spiritual gifts, and connection to divine authority that come with receiving the Holy Spirit through anointing. The inclusion of the note regarding variations in interpretation and experience adds nuance and awareness to the discussion. However, to enhance the answer, more scriptural references could be integrated to solidify the doctrinal foundation of each point."
