It covers various aspects of how receiving the Holy Spirit through anointing empowers believers for ministry, spiritual transformation, supernatural experiences, activation of spiritual gifts, and connection to divine authority. The inclusion of a note about different interpretations and experiences of anointing shows a recognition of diversity within Christian traditions. Overall, a strong and comprehensive response."
