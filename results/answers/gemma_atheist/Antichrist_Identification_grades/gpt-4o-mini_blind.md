50.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: While the student accurately acknowledged their limitation in providing information based on religious texts or beliefs, the response did not demonstrate an understanding or application of a Christian-specific worldview. In this case, a Christian perspective on defining an antichrist according to the apostle John is integral to grading this response effectively.
