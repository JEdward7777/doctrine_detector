Grade: 70

Comments: The student has provided a well-structured and detailed answer discussing the significance of the apostles in spreading the gospel from a cultural and historical perspective. The points mentioned, such as the apostles' diversity, personal witness, network expansion, transmission of oral tradition, and cultural influence, are valid and insightful. However, the answer lacks a clear connection to the theological significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus specifically, which is fundamental in understanding their mission and authority in spreading the gospel. Additionally, the inclusion of considerations for cultural retribution seems out of place in the context of discussing the apostles' role in spreading the gospel. Greater emphasis on the theological aspect and the unique authority given to the apostles by Jesus would strengthen the answer.
