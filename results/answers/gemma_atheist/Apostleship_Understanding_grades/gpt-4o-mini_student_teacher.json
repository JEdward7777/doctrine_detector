  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-structured answer highlighting the cultural and historical significance of the apostles in spreading the gospel. However, the student's response lacks a direct and concise connection to the ultimate purpose of the apostles being sent by Jesus as outlined in the reference answer from the teacher. The student could have further emphasized the authority given to the apostles by Christ and their pivotal role in establishing the early church. Strengthening this connection would have improved the alignment with the Christian worldview regarding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission."
