  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the apostles in spreading the gospel, addressing key points such as their cultural understanding, personal witness, network expansion, transmission of oral tradition, and cultural influence. The considerations for cultural retribution are thoughtful and demonstrate an awareness of the need for cultural sensitivity and understanding. The response effectively connects the role of the apostles to the Great Commission, highlighting their mission as crucial for the establishment and expansion of the early church. The only area for improvement could be to further emphasize the unique authority and commission given to the apostles by Jesus, tying it more explicitly to the context of the Great Commission."
