Grade: 95

Comment: The response correctly identifies Michael as the only angel referred to as an 'archangel' in the Bible. Acknowledging Michael's unique position is important in understanding the spiritual realm and the roles angels play in spiritual warfare and intercession from a Christian perspective. The deduction of 5 points is for not providing further elaboration on the importance of recognizing Michael's position in relation to spiritual warfare and intercession.
