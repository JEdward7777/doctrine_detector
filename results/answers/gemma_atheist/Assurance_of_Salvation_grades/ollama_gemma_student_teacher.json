  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a respectful and secular approach to the question. They acknowledge the importance of faith in many cultures and avoid making assumptions or generalizations about the beliefs of others. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus, as requested in the question."
