  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response strays significantly from the Christian perspective by focusing on atheistic, scholarly approaches and ethical principles unrelated to the Biblical context provided. The answer ignores the importance of genuine love without hypocrisy as outlined in Romans 12:9. It lacks understanding and application of the specific verse in question within a Christian worldview."
