The student demonstrates an understanding of the complexity of the issue and the nuances within the Bible's teachings. However, the answer could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the overarching principle of submitting to governing authorities as ordained by God, as outlined in Romans 13:1-7. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the ultimate authority of God over all rulers would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in sharpening the focus on key doctrinal points."
