  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed analysis of the biblical perspectives on the authority of governing rulers over their citizens. However, the student's response failed to emphasize the key point that governing rulers have been established by God and possess authority to govern and make laws, as stated in the reference answer. While the analysis of various biblical principles, interpretations, cultural contexts, and contemporary relevance was insightful, the lack of emphasis on the foundational biblical truth of God's establishment of governing rulers impacted the overall alignment with a Christian specific worldview."
