  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of providing biblical support for the idea that governing rulers have been established by God, citing Romans 13:1-2. It also acknowledges the complexity of biblical perspectives on authority, recognizing that there are different interpretations and cultural contexts to consider.\n\nOne area where the response could improve is in its development of the implications of this doctrine for contemporary society. While it mentions the importance of promoting just governance and exercising responsible citizenship, it does not explore these ideas in greater depth or provide concrete examples of how they can be applied in practice.\n\nOverall, however, I would say that the response provides a clear and well-supported explanation of the biblical teaching on governing authority, and demonstrates a good understanding of the concern to understand God's ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey."
