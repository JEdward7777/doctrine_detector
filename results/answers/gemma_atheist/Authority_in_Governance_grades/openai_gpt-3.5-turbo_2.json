  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive examination of the biblical perspectives on the authority of rulers and the responsibilities of citizens, touching on relevant biblical principles, interpretations, cultural contexts, and contemporary relevance. The student effectively integrates the given answer about the establishment of governing rulers by God as found in Romans 13:1-2. The response is well-structured and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. However, the discussion could have been strengthened by directly connecting the given answer to the student's reflections on the topic throughout the response."
