  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a detailed explanation of how the authority of the apostles related to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly within the cultural and social context of the 1st century. The student effectively discusses the significance of miracles as \"social proof\" and symbolic gestures, as well as the rhetorical reinforcement provided by preaching boldly. The emphasis on the apostles' direct connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of their authority aligns well with Christian doctrine. However, the answer could be strengthened by more direct references to biblical passages supporting the points made and explicitly tying them back to Christian theology. Overall, a solid analysis with room for additional doctrinal depth."
