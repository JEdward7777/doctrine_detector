  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student's response provides insightful analysis on the cultural and social context surrounding the authority of the apostles and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly, there is a notable omission in failing to emphasize the divine empowerment directly bestowed upon the apostles by God. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to highlight that the apostles' authority and ability to perform miracles stemmed from their connection to Jesus and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. The student's answer offers valuable perspectives on the broader context but lacks a clear focus on the central Christian belief in the divine source of the apostles' authority."
