  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a thorough and nuanced exploration of the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, going beyond a simplistic answer to delve deeper into the cultural, social, and symbolic context of their actions. The writer effectively highlights the multifaceted nature of the apostles' authority, acknowledging both its connection to Jesus Christ and its expression through miracles, bold preaching, and other means.\n\nThe response is well-organized, clear, and concise, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of specific examples and cultural references (e.g., \"social proof,\" \"rhetorical reinforcement\") adds depth and credibility to the argument.\n\nOne area for improvement would be to more explicitly connect the apostles' authority back to Jesus Christ throughout the response, rather than only mentioning this connection in the conclusion. Additionally, some minor suggestions for clarity or concision might be helpful, but overall, this is a strong response that effectively explores the concern and provides valuable insights into the nature of the apostles' authority.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical concept of divine empowerment and authority, and its connection to Jesus Christ. With some minor adjustments to emphasize this connection throughout the text, it could be an even stronger response."
