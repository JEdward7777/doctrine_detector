It appropriately acknowledges the role of miracles and bold preaching as manifestations of their authority while emphasizing that their ultimate source of legitimacy came from their direct connection to Jesus Christ. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview in interpreting the authority of the apostles in their ministry context."
