  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-researched and comprehensive answer exploring the biblical, cultural, and scholarly significance of the term \"Yahweh of hosts\" in relation to God's authority over spiritual beings. The student effectively connected this understanding to implications for biblical narratives and ethical principles. The only room for improvement would be to align the answer more closely with the teacher's reference answer, which explicitly mentions God's role as the ruler of heavenly armies and all creation."
