  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Yahweh of hosts\" from biblical, cultural, scholarly, and practical perspectives, addressing the concern of understanding God's authority to deepen faith. The analysis is well-structured, insightful, and aligns with a Christian worldview, emphasizing God's sovereignty over spiritual beings and the implications for believers. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific scriptural references to support some points, enhancing the biblical foundation of the explanation. Overall, a strong and deeply insightful response."
