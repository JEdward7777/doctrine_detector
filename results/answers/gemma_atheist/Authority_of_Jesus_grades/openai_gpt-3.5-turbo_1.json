However, it falls short in addressing the concern about believers acknowledging His sovereignty in their lives, which is a crucial aspect of understanding Jesus' authority from a Christian perspective. Encouraging a deeper reflection on the practical implications of recognizing Jesus' authority would have strengthened the response."
