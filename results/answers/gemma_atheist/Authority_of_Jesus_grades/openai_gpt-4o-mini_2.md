Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively highlights the Christian perspective on the title "King of the Jews" by emphasizing Jesus' authority and divine kingship over all creation. It aligns well with the concern of understanding Jesus' authority leading believers to acknowledge His sovereignty in their lives. The deduction in points is due to the initial refusal to engage with religious interpretations, which could have hindered a comprehensive evaluation of the significance of the title within Christian beliefs.
