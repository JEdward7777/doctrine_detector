  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 70. While the student provided a comprehensive overview of the authorship of the Psalms, including traditional and modern perspectives and important cultural factors, there was no mention of Moses or Solomon as key figures involved in writing the Psalms, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Acknowledging these key figures would have enhanced the accuracy and completeness of the student's response from a Christian worldview."
