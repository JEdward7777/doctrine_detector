  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response demonstrates some understanding of the complex authorship of the Psalms, acknowledging King David as a primary author and mentioning other key figures like Asaph. However, it lacks nuance in recognizing the diversity of authors and cultural contexts that contributed to the Psalms' composition. The response also does not explicitly address how recognizing authorship enhances understanding of the Psalms' messages and themes, which is the specified concern. While it touches on the importance of considering multiple authors and cultural frameworks, it could be improved by providing more specific examples or explanations of how this complex authorship informs our understanding of the Psalms."
