  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the considerations regarding the term \"Son of God\" in polytheistic cultures. They appropriately highlighted potential misunderstandings and the importance of inclusivity. However, the student's answer did not directly address the teacher's reference answer, which emphasized teaching the meaning of the term through context and explanation. Encouraging the student to connect their analysis to the reference answer would have strengthened their response."
