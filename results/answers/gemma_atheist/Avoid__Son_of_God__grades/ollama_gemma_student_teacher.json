  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive analysis of the potential for misunderstandings and cultural sensitivities surrounding the term \"Son of God.\"\n* Recognition of the importance of inclusivity and the potential for exclusion by avoiding the term.\n* Proposal of alternative approaches such as context-sensitive translation, neutral language, and emphasizing shared values.\n* Consideration of the need for balance between accuracy and respect in cross-cultural communication.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student's conclusion could be stronger by explicitly stating that the term \"Son of God\" should not be avoided but should be used with sensitivity and explanation in polytheistic cultures.\n* The student could provide additional examples of how the term has been successfully translated in different cultural contexts.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the complexities involved in translating religious terminology across cultures."
