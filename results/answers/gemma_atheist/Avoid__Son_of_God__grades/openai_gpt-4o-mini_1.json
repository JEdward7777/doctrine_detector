  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of not avoiding the term \"Son of God\" but instead emphasizes the need for careful teaching and explanation. However, the concerns raised regarding potential theological gaps and misunderstandings are not directly addressed or countered effectively in the response. There is a strong consideration for cultural sensitivity and open-minded dialogue, which aligns well with Christian principles of respect and understanding. Overall, a solid response that could be strengthened by directly addressing the specific concern raised."
