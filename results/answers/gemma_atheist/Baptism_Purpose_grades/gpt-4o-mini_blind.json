The references to Scripture are appropriate in supporting the points made. However, the student lands at an incorrect conclusion by suggesting that baptism is primarily symbolic from an atheistic perspective. In a Christian worldview, baptism is not just symbolic but a sacrament instituted by Christ Himself for believers to participate in obedience to His commands. Additionally, the student should have emphasized more strongly the importance of baptism as an act of obedience and public declaration of faith in Christ, aligning more closely with the doctrinal importance of baptism within Christian teachings."
