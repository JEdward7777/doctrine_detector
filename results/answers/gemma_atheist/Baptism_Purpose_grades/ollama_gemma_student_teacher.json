They provide insightful analysis of the symbolic and transformative aspects of the ritual, referencing relevant scripture to support their claims. \n\nWhile the student acknowledges the absence of explicit textual evidence regarding baptism being strictly necessary for salvation, they astutely highlight its importance as an outward expression of inward transformation. \n\nThe inclusion of their own perspective as an \"atheistic scholar\" adds an additional layer of nuance to their analysis, demonstrating critical thinking and intellectual curiosity."
