Comment: As a Christian worldview was not presented in this response, it fails to accurately address the question from the perspective of believing in God the Son and becoming a child of God the Father. The answer mainly focuses on cultural and philosophical interpretations, neglecting the theological aspect. From a Christian-specific viewpoint, the essence of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ as God the Son and the adoption as children of God the Father should have been emphasized.
