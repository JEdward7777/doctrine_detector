The focus on cultural, psychological, and ethical aspects, while important, somewhat detracts from directly addressing the core Christian beliefs outlined in the answer. The response could improve by balancing these perspectives with a more in-depth analysis of the Christian worldview and its implications for salvation and divine relationship."
