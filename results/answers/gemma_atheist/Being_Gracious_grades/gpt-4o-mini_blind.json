However, from a Christian worldview, the answer could have emphasized more on the foundational aspect of grace as a gift from God, undeserved mercy and kindness extended to us through Christ. The answer could have connected the concept of being gracious in our interactions with reflecting the grace we have received from God and extending it to others. Additionally, it could have highlighted the biblical principles of love, kindness, and humility as essential components of gracious interactions."
