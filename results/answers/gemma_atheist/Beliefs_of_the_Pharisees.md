## Pharisaic Beliefs Regarding Life After Death and Spiritual Beings:

The Pharisees held diverse beliefs about life after death and spiritual beings, influenced by their interpretations of scripture and their cultural context. Some common themes emerge:

**1. Belief in Immortality:**

* Pharisees believed in a physical resurrection of the righteous at the end of days.
* This belief stemmed from interpretations of prophecies like Daniel 12:2 and Psalms 16:10.

**4. Influence of Gnosticism:**

* Early Pharisees were influenced by Gnosticism, which emphasized the importance of spiritual knowledge (gnosis) for liberation from suffering.

**5. Focus on Practical Ethics:**
