  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a generally comprehensive overview of Pharisaic beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings. It covers key aspects such as belief in immortality, the intermediate state, and the recognition of spiritual beings. However, there are a few theological inaccuracies and misrepresentations present in the response, such as the mentioned influence of Gnosticism on Pharisaic beliefs, which is historically unlikely. Additionally, the criticism section lacks specific examples and could be further developed. Overall, while the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, better accuracy in theological details and additional support for certain claims would improve the grade."
