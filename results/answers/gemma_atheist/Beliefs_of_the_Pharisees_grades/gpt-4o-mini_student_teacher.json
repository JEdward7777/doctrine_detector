They included relevant scriptural references and discussed the influence of cultural factors on Pharisaic beliefs. However, the answer could have focused more on the specific beliefs of the Pharisees rather than delving into Gnosticism and other philosophical influences. It's important to stay closely aligned with the question and the specific context of the Pharisees during Jesus' time."
