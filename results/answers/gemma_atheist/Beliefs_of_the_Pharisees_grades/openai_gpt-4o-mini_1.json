It effectively addresses the concern by exploring these beliefs to enhance understanding of the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time. However, the response could have further elaborated on how these beliefs specifically distinguished the Pharisees from other Jewish groups like the Sadducees, as mentioned in the provided answer.
