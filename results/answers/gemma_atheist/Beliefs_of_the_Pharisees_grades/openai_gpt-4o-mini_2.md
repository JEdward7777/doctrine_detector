## Pharisaic Beliefs Regarding Life After Death and Spiritual Beings:

The Pharisees held diverse beliefs about life after death and spiritual beings, influenced by their interpretations of scripture and their cultural context. Some common themes emerge:

**1. Belief in Immortality:**

* Pharisees believed in a physical resurrection of the righteous at the end of days.
* This belief stemmed from interpretations of prophecies like Daniel 12:2 and Psalms 16:10.

**2. Intermediate State:**

* Pharisees believed in an intermediate state after death where the soul awaited the resurrection. 
* This state was often described as a shadowy or ethereal form of the physical body.

**3. Spiritual Beings:**

* The Pharisees recognized the existence of spiritual beings, including:
    * **Angels:** Messengers of God who could interact with humans.
    * **Demons:** Spirits of the wicked who tormented the living.
    * **Ghosts:** The spirits of the dead who lingered on earth.

**4. Influence of Gnosticism:**

* Early Pharisees were influenced by Gnosticism, which emphasized the importance of spiritual knowledge (gnosis) for liberation from suffering. 
* This belief influenced their focus on ethical living and their interpretation of afterlife as a form of spiritual liberation.

**5. Focus on Practical Ethics:**

* Despite their beliefs about the afterlife, the Pharisees remained focused on living a practical and ethical life. 
* Their actions were motivated by their desire to obey God and avoid punishment in the afterlife rather than by any fear of death.

**Cultural Influences:**

* The Pharisees' beliefs were also shaped by the cultural and political environment of their time.
* Babylonian and Greek ideas about the afterlife and spiritual beings influenced their understanding of these concepts.

**Criticisms:**

* These beliefs were criticized by other Jewish factions for being too influenced by Greek philosophy and lacking sufficient evidence from the Torah.

**Note:** 

* There was diversity among Pharisees in their beliefs and interpretations of these concepts.
* Early Christianity developed from Judaism and shared many beliefs with the Pharisees, including those related to life after death and spiritual beings.
