  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the term \"beloved\" in the New Testament letters, incorporating relevant cultural context, Pauline usage, and wider significance. The student effectively highlights the affectionate, familial, and loyal connotations of the term as used by Paul and its universal resonance. The mention of considering culturally nuanced interpretations is commendable. To improve the grade, the student could have included more direct scriptural references to support their points and further emphasized the theological significance of being called \"beloved\" in the context of God's love for humanity."
