The concern is about understanding how knowing Christ affects one's daily life, relationships, and community, but the response doesn't adequately address this aspect. It does mention some cultural benefits, such as fostering belonging and promoting empathy, but these are not directly tied to the practical implications of a relationship with Christ. Overall, the response could be improved by providing more concrete examples or applications of what it means to \"share in Christ\" in daily life."
