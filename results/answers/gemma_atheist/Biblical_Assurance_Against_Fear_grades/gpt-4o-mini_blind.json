  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a general overview of the significance of the phrase \"fear not\" in the Bible and makes some valid points regarding cultural considerations and interpretations. However, the answer lacks depth and fails to emphasize the foundational aspect of trusting in God's sovereignty and faithfulness. The focus on cultural relativism somewhat dilutes the doctrinal clarity needed in understanding God's assurance to believers. A stronger emphasis on biblical passages and theological implications would enhance the overall grade."
