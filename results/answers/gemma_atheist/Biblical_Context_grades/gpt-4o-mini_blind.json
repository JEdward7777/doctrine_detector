However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the answer falls short by not emphasizing the spiritual aspects and scriptural foundation of the role of deacons as outlined in the New Testament. The response should focus more on the biblical passages like 1 Timothy 3 and directly address the spiritual leadership and service aspects of deacons within the church. Additionally, the cultural considerations could have been tied back to biblical teachings to provide a more doctrinally sound perspective."
