  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive analysis of the responsibilities of deacons within the cultural context of first-century Judea, the primary concern provided was ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community. The student's response did not directly address this concern, leading to a lower grade. The answer could have been improved by highlighting the specific mention of fair distribution within the New Testament regarding deacon responsibilities."
