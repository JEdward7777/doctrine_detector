It acknowledges the importance of fair treatment and care within the church community while demonstrating a solid grasp of Christian principles and cultural considerations. The only minor improvement could be to directly address the concern by explicitly connecting the discussion on fair treatment and care to the responsibilities of deacons as outlined in the New Testament.\n"
