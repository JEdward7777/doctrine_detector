The references from Philippians, 2 Corinthians, and Galatians accurately depict Paul's humility and reliance on God's grace. The explanation of how Paul's humility was based on his understanding of God's sovereignty and his worth in Christ is insightful. The student effectively ties in the importance of considering cultural contexts when examining biblical examples of humility. The only room for improvement would have been to provide a bit more detail or analysis on how Paul's humility can serve as a model for Christians today."
