  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides several biblical examples of humility, specifically focusing on the apostle Paul's life and teachings. It highlights Paul's recognition of his place in relation to God's sovereignty, which is an excellent example of humility rooted in faith. The inclusion of specific verses from Philippians, 2 Corinthians, and Galatians further supports this response.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more directly tied to the original concern about finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. While David is mentioned as an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God, the majority of the response focuses on Paul's life and teachings. To better address the concern, the response could have provided more direct connections between David's story and the concept of humility.\n\nOverall, this response provides valuable examples of biblical humility and shows a strong understanding of the importance of faith in shaping one's perspective on humility. With some further attention to connecting the response directly to the original concern, it would be an even stronger submission."
