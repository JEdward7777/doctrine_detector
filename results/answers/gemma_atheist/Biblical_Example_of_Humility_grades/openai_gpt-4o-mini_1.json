  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough analysis of another biblical figure, the apostle Paul, as an example of extreme humility, addressing the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures well. The student effectively connects Paul's humility to biblical passages, contextualizes it within his cultural background, and explains how his humility was rooted in faith. The response also acknowledges the importance of considering cultural contexts when examining biblical examples. Overall, the depth of analysis and application of a Christian worldview warrant a high grade."
