  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical figures and analyzed their characteristics well. However, the student failed to include the key biblical figures cited as examples of blamelessness in the reference answer (Abraham and Noah). While the student's analysis is insightful, not addressing the specific concern provided in the question deducts points from the grade. Remember to focus on the key points mentioned in the question and provided reference for a more targeted response."
