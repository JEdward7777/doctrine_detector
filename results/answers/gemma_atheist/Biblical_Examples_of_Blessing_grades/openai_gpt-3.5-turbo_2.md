## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided a relevant example from religious texts regarding how blessings are illustrated in scripture, aligning with the concern raised. However, the initial response dismissing the use of religious texts due to a lack of belief in a deity does not fully engage with the topic from a Christian perspective, resulting in a lower grade. Incorporating a Christian worldview by acknowledging the significance of religious texts in understanding blessings would have strengthened the response.
