  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the student provided a detailed exploration of the theme of innocence in relation to Jesus Christ from a cultural and literary perspective, there are significant doctrinal inaccuracies in their interpretation of Scripture. The response falls short in acknowledging the foundational Christian belief in Jesus' innocence not just as a literary theme but as a fundamental truth of the faith. Additionally, the student's perspective lacks the acknowledgment of Jesus' divinity and the ultimate purpose of His sacrificial death for the atonement of sins. A more thorough grounding in Christian theology and doctrine would greatly enhance the accuracy and depth of the response."
