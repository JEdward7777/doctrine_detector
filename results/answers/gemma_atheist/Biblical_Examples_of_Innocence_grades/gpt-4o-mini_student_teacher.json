  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: The student provided well-written examples and analysis that demonstrate a good understanding of the theme of innocence in relation to Jesus Christ. However, the answer lacked direct references to pertinent Scriptures that specifically illustrate Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations, as requested in the question. Additionally, there was a lack of inclusion of the references from the reference answer provided by the teacher, which would have enriched the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
