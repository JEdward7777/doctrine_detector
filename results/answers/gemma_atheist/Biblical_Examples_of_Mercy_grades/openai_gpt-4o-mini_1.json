However, the response lacks depth in discussing scriptural references and real-life applications beyond the brief mention of Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan and the tax collector's prayer for mercy. Expanding on these scriptural references and providing more detailed real-life applications would enhance the understanding of mercy from a Christian perspective."
