However, the response could be improved by incorporating more scriptural references to support the examples mentioned, such as the ones in the given answer. The inclusion of real-life applications could further deepen the understanding of mercy in a practical context. Overall, a strong foundation on the topic with room for enhancement through more specific scriptural references and applications."
