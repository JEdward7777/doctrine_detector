  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the limitations of presenting biblical examples as evidence for the power of prayer from a Christian worldview. They provide a well-reasoned argument based on their atheist perspective and emphasize the importance of considering the historical, cultural, and literary contexts of the Bible. However, the student could have provided more specific examples from the Bible to support their claims."
