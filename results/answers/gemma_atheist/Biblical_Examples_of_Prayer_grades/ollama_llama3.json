While it briefly addresses the complexity of biblical interpretation, its overall tone is dismissive of the requested examples from the Bible.\n\nThe concern is specifically focused on learning from biblical stories to foster a stronger prayer life, which this response largely ignores. The scholar's statement about not believing in God and relying on empirical evidence instead of religious beliefs further distances their perspective from the concern."
