While the scholar's perspective as an atheist is respected, the response could have engaged with the biblical examples of prayer presented in the answer to provide insights on how these stories can be used to foster a stronger prayer life, even from an analytical or comparative lens. The lack of engagement with the specific concern within a Christian framework limits the depth of the response."
