However, the scholar's perspective is limited by their atheistic worldview, which leads to a dismissal of the examples provided from the Bible and fails to engage with the concern of learning from biblical stories to foster a stronger prayer life. In a Christian worldview, the power and importance of prayer are not solely based on empirical evidence but also on faith and spiritual growth, which are aspects not addressed in the response."
