  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough answer with relevant examples of repentance from the Bible. However, the student's lack of adherence to religious beliefs is evident in their failure to fully engage with the concept of repentance from a Christian worldview. The student should strive to demonstrate a deeper understanding of repentance as a spiritual and transformative act in the context of redemption and forgiveness through a Christian lens."
