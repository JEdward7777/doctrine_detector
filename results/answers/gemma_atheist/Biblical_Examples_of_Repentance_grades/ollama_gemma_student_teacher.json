  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of repentance and provides relevant examples from the Bible. The inclusion of diverse contexts and motivations for repentance is commendable. Additionally, the consideration of cultural and historical frameworks adds depth to the analysis. However, the absence of reference to the provided teacher's answer regarding specific biblical examples weakens the overall score."
