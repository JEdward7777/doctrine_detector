However, their approach lacks a Christian-specific worldview in addressing the concern about learning from biblical examples for believers' practical application of repentance in their lives. Emphasizing the significance of repentance in relation to salvation, transformation, and restoration through Christ would have enriched the response from a Christian perspective."
