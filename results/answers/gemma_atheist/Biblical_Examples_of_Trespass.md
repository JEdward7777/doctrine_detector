## Examples of Trespass in the Bible:

**1) The Garden of Eden:**

* God explicitly forbids Adam and Eve from eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, warning them it will result in death (Genesis 2:17). 
* This trespass symbolizes the human attempt to reach spiritual enlightenment through forbidden knowledge, leading to spiritual death.

**2) The Israelites and the Promised Land:**

* God makes specific boundaries for the Israelites in the Promised Land, including the establishment of sacred space like the Sabbath (Exodus 20:8-11). 
* Crossing these boundaries is seen as spiritual trespass, leading to punishment and loss of blessings.

**3) The Contamination of the Temple:**

* In the ancient Hebrew faith, entering the Temple with ritually unclean hands or objects was considered trespass. 
* Such violations resulted in ritual impurity and spiritual defilement.

**4) Paul's Warnings about False Doctrine:**

* Paul warns against tampering with or altering the gospel message, calling such actions trespass on the sacred trust (Galatians 1:9). 
* Distorting the truth is seen as a spiritual violation with severe consequences.

* **Respect for boundaries:** Trespassing violates established limits and boundaries, whether physical or spiritual. 
* **Spiritual consequences:** Certain actions have spiritual repercussions, often leading to loss of blessings or contamination.
