  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples of trespass in the Bible and explained how they reflect moral and spiritual lessons. The connections between trespass and spiritual consequences were clearly articulated, and the student effectively highlighted the importance of respecting boundaries and upholding spiritual integrity. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more in-depth analysis of each biblical example and delving deeper into the theological implications of trespass in the Christian worldview. Additionally, tying all the examples back to the overarching theme of redemption and forgiveness through Christ would have further enhanced the answer."
