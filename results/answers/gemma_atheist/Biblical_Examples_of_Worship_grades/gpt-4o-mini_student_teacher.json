  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response, effectively highlighting the negative contrast between genuine worship and idol worship in the context of Exodus 20. The student connected the passage to cultural considerations and the principle of cultural retribution, showing a deeper understanding of the Biblical concept of idolatry. However, the response could have been more concise and focused directly on the specific example of Exodus 20:3 that was requested in the question."
