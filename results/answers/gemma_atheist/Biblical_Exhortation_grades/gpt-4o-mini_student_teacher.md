Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer completely misses the mark on both the question and the concern provided. They fail to address the directive given by Jesus to his apostles regarding the good news and do not demonstrate an understanding of the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith. The response focuses on a tangential point about Jesus as a central figure in Christianity without engaging with the core themes of the question.
