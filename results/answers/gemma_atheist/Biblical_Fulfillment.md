## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the Bible do not reflect Old Testament prophecies.**

* These claims are based on interpretations of the Bible that are influenced by Christian theological beliefs.
* There is no archaeological, historical, or textual evidence to support the claim that Jesus was the rightful King of the Jews.
* The Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah are diverse and do not necessarily predict that he would be a Jew or a king.


**Cultural and Historical Context:**

* The concept of a "King of the Jews" is a cultural and political construct that emerged in ancient Israel.
* The Bible reflects the cultural and political beliefs of the ancient Israelites, and should not be interpreted in contemporary political or theological terms.

**Alternative Interpretations:**

* Many scholars argue that the references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" are symbolic or metaphorical.
* They suggest that the authors of the New Testament were using traditional Jewish imagery to describe Jesus' spiritual significance.

**Conclusion:**

The claim that the references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the Bible reflect Old Testament prophecies is not supported by historical or scholarly evidence. These claims are best understood as cultural and theological constructs that emerged in ancient Israel.
