  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the importance of biblical prophecy and its significance in Christian theology. They fail to acknowledge the key Old Testament prophecies that Jesus as the \"King of the Jews\" fulfills, specifically the lineage from David and the establishment of an everlasting kingdom. The lack of understanding of the Christian worldview in interpreting these prophecies greatly impacts the accuracy and depth of the response. The student's focus on cultural and historical context, alternative interpretations, and lack of evidence undermines the foundational beliefs of Christian theology."
