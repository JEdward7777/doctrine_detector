However, it dismissed the significance of recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment for Christian theology. From a Christian worldview, understanding and acknowledging the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus is essential for recognizing Him as the Messiah and affirming the continuity of God's redemptive plan throughout history. The response effectively addressed the concern but failed to align with a Christian perspective on biblical prophecy."
