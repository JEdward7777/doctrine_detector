As a Christian, it is important to recognize and understand the connection between the title \"King of the Jews\" and Old Testament prophecies, particularly those regarding the Messiah from David's line. The response fails to acknowledge the theological implications of these prophecies for Christian belief and does not align with a Christian perspective on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments. Additionally, by relying solely on secular interpretations and neglecting the Christian understanding of prophecy, the response overlooks the foundational principles of Christian theology."
