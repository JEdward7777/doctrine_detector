By relying solely on a literal interpretation of select verses (e.g., Jonah 1:14), the response neglects the rich cultural and historical contexts in which these texts were written. Furthermore, it overlooks the possibility that alternative perspectives can provide valuable insights into human experiences like guilt and sin, rather than simply resorting to supernatural explanations. To fully appreciate God's grace and mercy, it is essential to engage with a more comprehensive understanding of sin and its consequences, as presented in this response."
