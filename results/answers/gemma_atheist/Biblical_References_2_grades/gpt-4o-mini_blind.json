  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response lacks engagement with the question posed, which is specifically asking for Bible verses illustrating the concept of God's majesty from a Christian worldview. In a Christian context, it is essential to be able to reference and discuss relevant scripture when addressing theological concepts like God's majesty. This response does not align with the requirements of the question or demonstrate an understanding of a Christian-specific worldview."
