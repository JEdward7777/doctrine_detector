However, the LLM's disclaimer about not providing interpretations or endorsing religious beliefs limits its ability to engage further with the scriptural references or explore the implications of God's majesty. While it takes a step in the right direction by providing relevant Bible passages, it could have gone further in connecting these scriptures with the concept of God's majestic nature, which is a crucial aspect of Christian theology and understanding."
