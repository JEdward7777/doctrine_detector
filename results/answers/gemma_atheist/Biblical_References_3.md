## Old Testament references relevant to understanding the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah:

**1. Messianic prophecies:**

* **Psalm 22:** Describes the suffering and exaltation of the Messiah, aligning with the "Son of Man" who experiences humiliation and ultimate vindication.
* **Psalm 110:** Predicts the Messiah's dominion over God's people and establishment of lasting peace, themes echoed in the "Son of Man" figure.
* **Isaiah 53:** Describes the suffering servant who endures humiliation and death, consistent with the sacrificial nature of the Son of Man prophecy.
* **Daniel 7:** Foretells the emergence of a "son of man" who receives dominion and establishes a kingdom, aligning with the Messianic expectations.

**2. Ancient Near Eastern parallels:**

* **Enuma Elish:** Babylonian epic featuring a divine being who descends to Earth, suffers humiliation, and ultimately becomes victorious, mirroring the "Son of Man" narrative.
* **Sutema:** Assyrian legend of a divine being who descends to Earth, suffers crucifixion, and is resurrected, connecting with the Son of Man's sacrifice and resurrection.

**3. Contextual considerations:**

* **Authorial intent:** Understanding the original authors' cultural and literary contexts is crucial in interpreting Messianic prophecies. Many prophecies were influenced by ancient Near Eastern literature, where figures like the "Son of God" or "divine son" were common themes.
* **Historical interpretations:** Early Christian interpretations of the "Son of Man" drew heavily on these Old Testament references, shaping subsequent theological understanding.

**4. Hermeneutical challenges:**

* Reconciling these diverse references with other Christian doctrines like the divinity of Christ requires careful theological interpretation.
* Identifying and understanding cultural parallels is crucial in avoiding cultural bias and anachronistic interpretations.


**Conclusion:**

While these Old Testament references contribute to the understanding of the "Son of Man" as a Messianic figure, interpreting them requires a nuanced understanding of their cultural context, literary genres, and subsequent historical interpretations.
