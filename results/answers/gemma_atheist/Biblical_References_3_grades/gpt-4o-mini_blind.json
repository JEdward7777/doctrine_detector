  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively identifies relevant Old Testament references pertaining to the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah. The inclusion of Messianic prophecies, ancient Near Eastern parallels, contextual considerations, and hermeneutical challenges demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more direct scriptural connections to the \"Son of Man\" concept and by emphasizing the centrality of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of these prophecies in Christian theology."
