  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of Old Testament references relevant to understanding the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah. They have demonstrated a good grasp of the Messianic prophecies and ancient Near Eastern parallels that contribute to the understanding of this title for the Messiah. However, the student could improve their answer by including the key references specified by the teacher, such as Daniel 7:14 and the connection to Ezekiel. Additionally, while the student addressed contextual considerations and hermeneutical challenges, they could further strengthen their argument by emphasizing the importance of these aspects in interpreting the 'Son of Man' in Christian theology. Overall, a solid effort with room for minor enhancements."
