The discussion covers messianic prophecies (Psalm 22, Psalm 110, Isaiah 53), ancient Near Eastern parallels (Enuma Elish, Sutema), contextual considerations (authorial intent, historical interpretations), and hermeneutical challenges. While the original answer only mentioned Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel, this response addresses the concern by exploring the Old Testament's role in shaping the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have more explicitly connected these Old Testament references to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the \"Son of Man.\" Additionally, some discussion on how these Old Testament references are fulfilled or typologically pointing to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection would strengthen the connection between the Old and New Testaments. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a thorough engagement with the relevant biblical texts and provides a solid foundation for exploring the messianic role of Jesus as the \"Son of Man.\""
