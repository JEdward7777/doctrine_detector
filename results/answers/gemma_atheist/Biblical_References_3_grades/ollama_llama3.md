## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
## Old Testament references relevant to understanding the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah:

**1. Messianic prophecies:**

* **Psalm 22:** Describes the suffering and exaltation of the Messiah, aligning with the "Son of Man" who experiences humiliation and ultimate vindication.
* **Psalm 110:** Predicts the Messiah's dominion over God's people and establishment of lasting peace, themes echoed in the "Son of Man" figure.
* **Isaiah 53:** Describes the suffering servant who endures humiliation and death, consistent with the sacrificial nature of the Son of Man prophecy.
* **Daniel 7:** Foretells the emergence of a "son of man" who receives dominion and establishes a kingdom, aligning with the Messianic expectations.

**2. Ancient Near Eastern parallels:**

* **Enuma Elish:** Babylonian epic featuring a divine being who descends to Earth, suffers humiliation, and ultimately becomes victorious, mirroring the "Son of Man" narrative.
* **Sutema:** Assyrian legend of a divine being who descends to Earth, suffers crucifixion, and is resurrected, connecting with the Son of Man's sacrifice and resurrection.

**3. Contextual considerations:**

* **Authorial intent:** Understanding the original authors' cultural and literary contexts is crucial in interpreting Messianic prophecies. Many prophecies were influenced by ancient Near Eastern literature, where figures like the "Son of God" or "divine son" were common themes.
* **Historical interpretations:** Early Christian interpretations of the "Son of Man" drew heavily on these Old Testament references, shaping subsequent theological understanding.

**4. Hermeneutical challenges:**

* Reconciling these diverse references with other Christian doctrines like the divinity of Christ requires careful theological interpretation.
* Identifying and understanding cultural parallels is crucial in avoiding cultural bias and anachronistic interpretations.


**Conclusion:**

While these Old Testament references contribute to the understanding of the "Son of Man" as a Messianic figure, interpreting them requires a nuanced understanding of their cultural context, literary genres, and subsequent historical interpretations.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of Old Testament references relevant to understanding Jesus as the Messiah, specifically in relation to the "Son of Man" title. The discussion covers messianic prophecies (Psalm 22, Psalm 110, Isaiah 53), ancient Near Eastern parallels (Enuma Elish, Sutema), contextual considerations (authorial intent, historical interpretations), and hermeneutical challenges. While the original answer only mentioned Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel, this response addresses the concern by exploring the Old Testament's role in shaping the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role.

However, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have more explicitly connected these Old Testament references to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the "Son of Man." Additionally, some discussion on how these Old Testament references are fulfilled or typologically pointing to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection would strengthen the connection between the Old and New Testaments. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a thorough engagement with the relevant biblical texts and provides a solid foundation for exploring the messianic role of Jesus as the "Son of Man."
