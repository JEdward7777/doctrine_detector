The connection between Daniel 7 and Ezekiel in illustrating the prophetic identity of the \"Son of Man\" is briefly addressed. The analysis is well-supported and demonstrates a strong grasp of how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' However, the response could benefit from a more detailed exploration of how specific Old Testament prophecies directly relate to Jesus as the fulfillment of the Son of Man concept in the New Testament. Overall, a comprehensive and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
