  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70. While the student provided relevant biblical passages illustrating the use of 'Lord' in the context of God and explained the significance well, the teacher's reference answer provided more concise and directly applicable examples from Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11. Encouraging the student to focus on more scripturally specific references to further reinforce the understanding of God's authority would enhance their response."
