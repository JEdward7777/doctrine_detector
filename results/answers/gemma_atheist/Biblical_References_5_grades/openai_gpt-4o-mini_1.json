  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed interpretation of how 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings, emphasizing purity and sanctity. The relevance section further elaborates on the importance of cultural sensitivity in interpreting religious teachings. The answer effectively addresses the concern by identifying a specific biblical text and providing insightful analysis. However, to further improve the grade, the response could have incorporated more scriptural references to support the interpretation given."
