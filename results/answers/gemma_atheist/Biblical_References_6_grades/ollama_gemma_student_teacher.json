They provide relevant biblical verses and supporting historical and cultural evidence. However, the critique of the lack of historical evidence and the inclusion of alternative explanations weaken the overall argument. Additionally, the omission of some traditional Christian interpretations of resurrection may be seen as biased from a Christian-specific worldview."
