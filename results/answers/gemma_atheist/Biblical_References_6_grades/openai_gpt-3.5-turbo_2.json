  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed exploration of the concept of resurrection in the Bible from a cultural and historical perspective, drawing on relevant biblical verses and discussing various cultural and historical contexts. However, it falls short of effectively engaging with the concern of focusing on scripture as key for grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts. While the response acknowledges the importance of biblical verses on resurrection, it primarily approaches the topic from a secular standpoint rather than engaging with a Christian-specific worldview. For a higher grade, the response should have incorporated more direct references to Christian teachings and doctrines on resurrection, aligning with the concern provided."
