  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response provides a thorough exploration of the concept of resurrection from a cultural and historical perspective, it falls short of focusing on scripture as the key foundation for Christian beliefs and teachings. The analysis lacks a biblical interpretation and fails to engage with the specific verses provided in the given answer. To improve the grade, the response should incorporate a deeper examination of the biblical passages mentioned and emphasize the authoritative nature of scripture in shaping Christian understanding of resurrection."
