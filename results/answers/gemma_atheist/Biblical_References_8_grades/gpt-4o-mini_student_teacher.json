  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively explores the concept of ransom in the context of redemption. They have referenced relevant Bible verses and made insightful connections to the theological implications of redemption through rescue, sacrifice, exchange, liberation, and inclusivity. While the student did not include all the key verses specified in the teacher's reference answer, their analysis and interpretation demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview."
