  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical concept of ransom and its relevance to redemption from a Christian perspective. The student provides relevant scripture references and clearly explains the exchange and liberating nature of redemption through Christ's sacrifice. However, including the additional key verses suggested by the teacher would have strengthened the response and provided a more comprehensive analysis."
