  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's response does not engage with the question at all and does not address the concern of connecting scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness. From a Christian worldview, it is important to seek to understand and interpret biblical texts even if one does not personally adhere to the beliefs. The student missed an opportunity to explore the concept of covenant faithfulness within the context of religious texts."
