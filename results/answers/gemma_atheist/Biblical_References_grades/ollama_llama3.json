  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe student acknowledges that their atheist perspective limits their ability to provide interpretations of religious texts or beliefs, which shows an understanding of the concern about applying faith-based concepts from a non-Christian worldview. However, the response does not directly address the concern of connecting scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness. Instead, it provides new biblical references (Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18) that illustrate the idea of covenant faithfulness without explicitly discussing how these scriptures relate to the concept.\n\nTo improve this response, the student could have connected the dots between the scriptural examples and their understanding of covenant faithfulness, providing a more explicit application of biblical teachings."
