## [Answer](../Biblical_References.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response did not effectively connect the scriptural examples of Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18 to the concept of covenant faithfulness, as requested. The answer merely mentions the verses without providing any analysis or explanation within the context of covenant faithfulness. The perspective of the grader being an atheist also limits the ability to provide a meaningful evaluation from a Christian worldview.
