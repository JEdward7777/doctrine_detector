The student provides thoughtful analysis of the cultural and philosophical perspectives on the concept of heaven, considering both traditional theistic and alternative viewpoints. The response is well-written and demonstrates critical thinking skills. However, including some of the specific key verses suggested by the teacher would have elevated the grade."
