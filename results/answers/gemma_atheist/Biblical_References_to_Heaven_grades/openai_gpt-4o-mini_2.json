  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough overview of how scholars interpret Bible verses related to the concept of heaven, offering detailed explanations for key verses. However, the response lacks engagement with the specific references provided in the concern about God's kingdom and the physical and spiritual realities associated with heaven. While the response is well-researched and informative, a deeper analysis and connection to the specified concern would have enhanced the overall evaluation."
