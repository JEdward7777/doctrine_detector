  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the Festival of Weeks, including references from Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Chronicles, and Ezra. However, the student missed the reference to Acts in which the significance of the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) is explicitly highlighted in the New Testament. This additional reference would have strengthened their answer from a Christian perspective. However, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the historical and cultural context of the Festival of Weeks in the Old Testament."
