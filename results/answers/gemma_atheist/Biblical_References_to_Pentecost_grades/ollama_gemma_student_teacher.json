They provide a comprehensive list of relevant texts and acknowledge the importance of interpreting these texts within their historical and cultural contexts. While their response aligns well with the given concern, it could benefit from a more direct engagement with the provided reference answer by explicitly mentioning the books mentioned (2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts)."
