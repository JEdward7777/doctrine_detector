  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe student has partially addressed the concern by providing some biblical references related to the Festival of Weeks, which is relevant to understanding the scriptural basis for Pentecost. However, their response lacks specificity and accuracy in terms of the actual texts that reference the Festival of Weeks. Specifically, Acts is not a correct reference (Acts actually refers to the events of Pentecost itself, rather than the festival), and Leviticus, Numbers, and Ezra are omitted from the list.\n\nTo improve this response, the student should strive for greater accuracy and comprehensiveness in their listing of biblical references related to the Festival of Weeks. Additionally, they could provide more context and analysis about how these texts contribute to our understanding of Pentecost."
