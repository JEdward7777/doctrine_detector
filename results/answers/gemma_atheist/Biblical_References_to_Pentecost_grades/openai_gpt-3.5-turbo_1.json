However, the initial statement about the interpretation of religious texts needing caution and sensitivity seems to imply a secular approach rather than a Christian-specific worldview. The mention of Acts in the given answer would have been beneficial for Christian readers, as this book in the New Testament also references the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost). To improve, the response could have highlighted the Christian significance of Pentecost in Acts in relation to the Jewish holiday of Shavuot."
