However, the initial answer incorrectly states that Acts references the Festival of Weeks, when in fact Acts discusses the Day of Pentecost. The concern was to understand the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost, so there was some confusion in the response regarding the specific event being discussed. It is important to be precise in biblical references when discussing religious events and observances."
