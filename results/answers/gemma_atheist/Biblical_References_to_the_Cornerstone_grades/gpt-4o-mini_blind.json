However, in the context of the question, the response lacks engagement with the content and does not attempt to address the specific verses or convey any understanding of Jesus as the cornerstone from a Christian perspective. A more suitable approach would involve mentioning the verses and briefly pointing out the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in Christian theology, even if it is not personally endorsed by the student."
