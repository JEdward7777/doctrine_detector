Which Bible verses specifically reference Jesus as the cornerstone, and what do they convey about His role?

Verses like Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22 highlight His essential role in the foundation of faith and the Church.

Given my atheism, I am unable to provide interpretations of religious texts or beliefs. The statements regarding Bible verses referencing Jesus as the cornerstone are based on faith-based perspectives and are not within my realm of knowledge or expertise.

Grade: 20

Comment: Although it is understandable that the student's atheism limits their ability to provide interpretations of religious texts, the concern was about encouraging believers to explore scripture to deepen their understanding of Jesus' significance. In this case, the student could have acknowledged the importance of exploring the biblical references provided even from a historical or literary perspective. It's important to recognize the value of engaging with religious texts even if one does not adhere to the faith, as they carry significant cultural and historical weight.
