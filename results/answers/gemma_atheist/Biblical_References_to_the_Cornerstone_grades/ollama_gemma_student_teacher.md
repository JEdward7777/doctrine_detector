Verses like Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22 highlight His essential role in the foundation of faith and the Church.

Given my atheism, I am unable to provide interpretations of religious texts or beliefs. The statements regarding Bible verses referencing Jesus as the cornerstone are based on faith-based perspectives and are not within my realm of knowledge or expertise.

**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:**

The student demonstrates an understanding of the concern by acknowledging the importance of exploring scripture for a deeper understanding of Jesus' significance. However, the limitation of their expertise due to their atheism significantly reduces the depth and comprehensiveness of their response. While they provide a concise explanation of their inability to interpret religious texts, they could have elaborated on the importance of faith-based perspectives in understanding religious concepts.
