  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response acknowledges that it cannot provide interpretations of religious texts or beliefs, which shows respect for the limits of its knowledge and expertise. However, it does not engage with the concern to encourage believers to explore scripture deepens their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith. The response simply states what the Bible verses say without providing any additional insight or encouragement.\n\nA higher score could be achieved if the response had provided some reflection on how exploring these scriptures can deepen a believer's understanding of Jesus' significance, even if it did not attempt to interpret the verses themselves."
