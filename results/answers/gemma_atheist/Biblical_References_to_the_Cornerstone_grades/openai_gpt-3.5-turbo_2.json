However, the student's atheistic worldview prevents them from delving into interpretations of religious texts. Encouraging believers to explore scripture not only deepens their understanding of Jesus' significance but also allows for personal growth and connection with God. The response could benefit from recognizing the value of biblical exploration for believers, even if it is not from the perspective of personal belief."
