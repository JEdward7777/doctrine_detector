  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided by the student is respectful of their atheistic perspective, which is acknowledged. However, their limitation in interpreting religious texts should not hinder them from objectively analyzing and discussing the significance of these Bible verses. While faith plays a role in understanding the meanings, a scholarly and historical approach could still be taken to discuss the impact of these verses on Christian beliefs. The concern emphasizes the importance of deepening believers' understanding, which the student failed to address in their response."
