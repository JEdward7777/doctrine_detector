## Question [Biblical References to the Cornerstone](../../../questions/Biblical_References_to_the_Cornerstone.md)
Which Bible verses specifically reference Jesus as the cornerstone, and what do they convey about His role?

## Correct Answer
Verses like Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22 highlight His essential role in the foundation of faith and the Church.

Encouraging believers to explore scripture deepens their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith.

Given my atheism, I am unable to provide interpretations of religious texts or beliefs. The statements regarding Bible verses referencing Jesus as the cornerstone are based on faith-based perspectives and are not within my realm of knowledge or expertise.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response provided by the student is respectful of their atheistic perspective, which is acknowledged. However, their limitation in interpreting religious texts should not hinder them from objectively analyzing and discussing the significance of these Bible verses. While faith plays a role in understanding the meanings, a scholarly and historical approach could still be taken to discuss the impact of these verses on Christian beliefs. The concern emphasizes the importance of deepening believers' understanding, which the student failed to address in their response.
