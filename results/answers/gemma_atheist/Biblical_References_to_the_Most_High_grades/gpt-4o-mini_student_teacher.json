  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses reinforcing the idea of God as the 'Most High' and offered insightful reflections on the character traits revealed through these verses. However, the student missed including key verses such as Psalm 83:18 and Daniel 4:17 provided in the reference answer, which would have further enhanced the completeness of the response. The student's awareness of the need for cultural sensitivity in interpreting these verses is commendable. Improving by incorporating additional relevant verses and focusing on enhancing theological depth and coherence in the explanations would lead to a higher grade."
