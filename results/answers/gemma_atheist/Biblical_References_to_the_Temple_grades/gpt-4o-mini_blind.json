  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student recognizes the inaccuracy in the question but fails to provide any correct scriptures or explanations from a Christian worldview. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and clarity, resulting in a lower grade. A better answer would have provided specific biblical references such as 1 Kings 8:13, 2 Chronicles 7:12, or Psalms 23:6 to support the understanding of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" in Christian theology."
