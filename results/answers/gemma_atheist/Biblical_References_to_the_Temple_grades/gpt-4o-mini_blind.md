## Correct Answer

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The scriptures do not specifically reference the temple as the "house of Yahweh" in an atheistic or culturally retributed manner.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
40.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student recognizes the inaccuracy in the question but fails to provide any correct scriptures or explanations from a Christian worldview. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and clarity, resulting in a lower grade. A better answer would have provided specific biblical references such as 1 Kings 8:13, 2 Chronicles 7:12, or Psalms 23:6 to support the understanding of the temple as the "house of Yahweh" in Christian theology.
