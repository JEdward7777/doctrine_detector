Which scriptures specifically reference the temple as the 'house of Yahweh'?

## Correct Answer
1 Kings 8:44, 2 Chronicles 6:4, and other verses in the content reference the temple as the 'house of Yahweh'.

Identifying key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house.

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The scriptures do not specifically reference the temple as the "house of Yahweh" in an atheistic or culturally retributed manner.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
50.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: The student's response shows a lack of understanding of the Christian perspective on the temple as the "house of Yahweh." The correct scriptures were provided in the reference answer but the student's answer failed to address the concern adequately. A better understanding and knowledge of Christian theology would greatly improve the response.
