## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** 
The student's answer demonstrates a partial understanding of the scriptures and their reference to the temple as God's house. However, the student's inaccuracy in stating that the scriptures do not specifically reference the temple as the "house of Yahweh" in an atheistic or culturally retributed manner demonstrates a lack of precision and fails to address the specific concern of the teacher.
