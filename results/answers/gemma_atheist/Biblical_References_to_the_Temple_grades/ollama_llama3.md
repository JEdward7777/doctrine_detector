## Question [Biblical References to the Temple](../../../questions/Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md)
Which scriptures specifically reference the temple as the 'house of Yahweh'?

## Correct Answer
1 Kings 8:44, 2 Chronicles 6:4, and other verses in the content reference the temple as the 'house of Yahweh'.

## Stated Concern
Identifying key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house.

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The scriptures do not specifically reference the temple as the "house of Yahweh" in an atheistic or culturally retributed manner.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response correctly identifies that the original question's premise is inaccurate, which shows some understanding of biblical interpretation. However, it does not directly address the concern about identifying key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house. Instead, it presents an opposing view without engaging with the original answer or providing any scripture references.

To improve this response, the author could have acknowledged the original answer and then presented their own scripture-based argument, rather than simply stating that the premise is inaccurate. This would demonstrate a more thorough engagement with the concern and show a deeper understanding of biblical interpretation.

Comment: While this response shows some awareness of biblical interpretation, it falls short in addressing the concern and providing relevant scripture references to support its claim.
