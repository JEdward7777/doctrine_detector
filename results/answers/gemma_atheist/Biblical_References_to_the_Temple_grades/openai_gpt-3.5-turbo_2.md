Grade: 95

Comment: The response accurately provides specific verses (1 Kings 8:44, 2 Chronicles 6:4) that directly reference the temple as the "house of Yahweh" in the scriptures, addressing the concern raised. However, to further enhance the grade, the response could have briefly explained the significance of the temple being referred to as God's house in these scriptures from a Christian perspective.
