  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies key scriptures (1 Kings 8:44, 2 Chronicles 6:4) that discuss the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" in relation to God. The initial concern is properly addressed with scriptural references. The deduction in score is due to the tone of the response, which could have been more respectful or polite in addressing the concern."
