  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 75.\n\nThe response provides some relevant biblical examples to support the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. The references to Ezekiel, Habakkuk, and Matthew are accurate and demonstrate an understanding of the concept of \"woe\" being used to emphasize severe judgment.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not fully engage with the concern or provide additional insight into the nature of divine judgment. The statement that \"woe is often used to emphasize severe judgment upon those who sin or lead others astray\" is a good starting point, but it could be further developed to explore the implications of this concept for Christian living and discipleship.\n\nAdditionally, while the response acknowledges the potential contentiousness of interpreting religious texts, it does not provide any specific examples or insights that would demonstrate sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives. Overall, the response provides some useful biblical examples, but could benefit from more depth and engagement with the concern."
