It effectively addresses the concern regarding the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture from a Christian perspective. The deductive points are well-supported and demonstrate a solid understanding of the theological implications within the specific passages cited. The only minor critique would be to include more direct biblical references to further strengthen the analysis."
