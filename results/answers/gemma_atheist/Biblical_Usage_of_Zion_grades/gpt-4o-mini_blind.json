In a Christian context, understanding the figurative ways the term 'Zion' is used in the Bible is essential for interpreting biblical themes and prophecies. A more suitable response would provide insight into how 'Zion' is symbolically linked to God's chosen people, the church, and His kingdom. We need to always be prepared to give a reason for the hope that we have with gentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:15), even when discussing religious or sensitive topics."
