Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a thorough and detailed answer that covers various materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times. They showed an understanding of how different materials were used in different biblical periods and contexts, which aligns well with the concern of deepening a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and worship. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the specific materials mentioned in the teacher's reference answer, such as packed dirt, wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze. Overall, a strong effort with room for minor improvements.
