  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the materials used in constructing altars during biblical times, but lacks specificity and accuracy. While it correctly mentions packed dirt and large stones as possible materials, it fails to provide any concrete examples or descriptions of altars from biblical times. Additionally, the mention of special altars constructed from wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze is somewhat accurate but also incomplete. The response does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the cultural significance of altar construction and its relevance to Christian worship.\n\nTo improve this grade, the response could provide more detailed examples of different materials used in constructing altars during biblical times, as well as explanations of their cultural and symbolic meanings. It could also explore how understanding these practices can deepen a Christian's appreciation for biblical worship."
