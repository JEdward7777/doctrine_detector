## Question [Calling to Sanctification](../../../questions/Calling_to_Sanctification.md)
What command is given to believers regarding their personal sanctification?

## Correct Answer
Believers in Jesus are commanded to sanctify themselves to God and to be holy in everything they do.

## Stated Concern
Emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process.

## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Atheism is a lack of belief in the existence of deities and does not involve any religious or spiritual concepts of sanctification.

Grade: 10/100

Comment: The answer completely missed the mark by not addressing the question at all. It failed to provide any information on the command given to believers regarding their personal sanctification from a Christian perspective. The response focused on atheism, which was irrelevant to the question asked. A correct answer would have cited biblical references and explained the importance of sanctification in the life of a Christian believer.
