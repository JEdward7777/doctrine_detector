## Question [Calling to Sanctification](../../../questions/Calling_to_Sanctification.md)
What command is given to believers regarding their personal sanctification?

## Correct Answer
Believers in Jesus are commanded to sanctify themselves to God and to be holy in everything they do.

## Stated Concern
Emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process.

## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Atheism is a lack of belief in the existence of deities and does not involve any religious or spiritual concepts of sanctification.
