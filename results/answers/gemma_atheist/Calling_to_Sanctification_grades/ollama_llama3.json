  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately addresses the concern about personal responsibility in the sanctification process by emphasizing that it is believers who are commanded to sanctify themselves to God, rather than relying solely on external forces or divine intervention. This shows an understanding of the importance of individual agency and effort in the process of sanctification.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger by more explicitly connecting the idea of personal responsibility to the concept of sanctification. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide further explanation or biblical support for this idea, rather than simply stating it as a fact."
