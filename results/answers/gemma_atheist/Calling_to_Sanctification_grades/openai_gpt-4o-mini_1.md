## Question [Calling to Sanctification](../../../questions/Calling_to_Sanctification.md)
What command is given to believers regarding their personal sanctification?

## Correct Answer
Believers in Jesus are commanded to sanctify themselves to God and to be holy in everything they do.

## Stated Concern
Emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process.

## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. Atheism is a lack of belief in the existence of deities and does not involve any religious or spiritual concepts of sanctification.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process, aligning with Christian teachings that believers are called to sanctify themselves to God and strive for holiness. However, the grading is not perfect as it does not directly address the inaccurate premise in the initial response that atheism lacks religious or spiritual concepts of sanctification. Be sure to directly address the concern raised in the prompt for a more comprehensive response.
