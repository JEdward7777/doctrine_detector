  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 75. The answer provides a good analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus regarding faith and authority. The student correctly highlights the cultural context, the centurion's faith transcending boundaries, the relationship between authority and humility, and the nature of genuine faith. There is a solid understanding of the implications of this interaction. However, the answer could benefit from a deeper exploration of how Jesus' authority is rooted in His divine nature and how faith in Him leads to salvation. Additionally, tying in specific biblical references or theological concepts would strengthen the analysis. Overall, a solid response but with room for deeper theological reflection."
