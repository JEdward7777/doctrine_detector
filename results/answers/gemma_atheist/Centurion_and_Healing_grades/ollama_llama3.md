I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response demonstrates a good understanding of the key aspects of faith and authority in the context of Jesus' ministry, particularly with regards to the centurion's display of great faith. The writer highlights the importance of faith in divine power, which is a crucial aspect of Jesus' message. They also touch on the theme of humility and trust, which are essential components of genuine faith.

The response is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear headings and concise points. The writer provides specific examples from the biblical text to support their claims, which strengthens their argument.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. For instance, while the writer mentions the importance of humility and trust, they do not explore these themes in depth or provide additional biblical evidence to support their claims. Additionally, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the centurion's faith and the broader implications for understanding faith and authority in Jesus' ministry.

Overall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good grasp of the key issues at stake. With some further development and refinement, it has the potential to be even stronger.
