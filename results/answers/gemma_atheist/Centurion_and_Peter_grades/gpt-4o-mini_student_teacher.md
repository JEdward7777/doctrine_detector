Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a well-structured and insightful answer that effectively discusses the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community through the centurion's visit from Peter. The points made about breaking down cultural and religious barriers, recognizing the universality of the Gospel, shifting the focus from Judaism to Christianity, challenging prejudices, and prefiguring the Gospel's inclusivity are all valid and supported with relevant explanations. However, the answer could have been more concise and directly addressed the concern by emphasizing God's love and salvation for all people as foundational to Christian teaching, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. So, while the student's response is comprehensive, it could have been more centered on the specific concern of the mission of the Church to reach all nations and the inclusivity of the Gospel.
