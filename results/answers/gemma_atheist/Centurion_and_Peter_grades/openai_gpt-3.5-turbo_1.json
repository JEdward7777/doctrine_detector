The points made in the response effectively address the concern regarding understanding the mission of the Church to reach all nations and the inclusivity of the Gospel from a Christian worldview. However, to align more closely with a Christian-specific perspective, incorporating more direct references to Scripture or theological teachings could strengthen the argument."
