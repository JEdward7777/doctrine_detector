It effectively addresses the concern regarding the mission of the Church to reach all nations and the inclusivity of the Gospel by highlighting key points such as breaking down cultural and religious barriers, recognizing the universality of the Gospel, shifting focus from Judaism to Christianity, challenging prejudices, and prefiguring the Gospel's eventual embrace by all. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of God's love and salvation for all people, which is foundational to Christian teaching."
