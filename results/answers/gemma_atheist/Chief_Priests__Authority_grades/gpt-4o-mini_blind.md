Comment: The answer provides a solid overview of the relationship between chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Hebrew religion. It correctly identifies the hierarchical authority structure, the differing roles of each group, the control and discipline maintained by the chief priests, and the cultural context shaping these dynamics.
