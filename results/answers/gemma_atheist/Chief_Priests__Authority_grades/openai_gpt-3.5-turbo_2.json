It effectively elaborates on the hierarchical authority, differing roles, control and discipline, cultural context, and implications of this religious leadership structure. The explanation is thorough, well-organized, and demonstrates a clear understanding of how the chief priests wielded authority over the ordinary priests within the religious system of ancient Israel. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel from a Christian-specific worldview."
