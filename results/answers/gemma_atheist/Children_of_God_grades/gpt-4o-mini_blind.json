The student effectively discusses psychological, cultural, theological, and spiritual aspects related to the topic. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the foundational Christian doctrine that believers are adopted into God's family through faith in Jesus Christ (John 1:12, Romans 8:15-17). In a Christian worldview, this sonship is not merely symbolic but carries profound spiritual implications of redemption, reconciliation, and inheritance. Integrating this core theological truth would strengthen the answer and align it more closely with a Christian-specific perspective."
