  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive analysis of the impact of being referred to as 'children of God' on the relationship between believers and God. They have explored various dimensions such as psychological and emotional implications, cultural and social influences, theological interpretations, power dynamics, accountability, cultural conditioning, and spiritual growth. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents thoughtful insights. However, it would have been beneficial if they directly connected their analysis to the reference answer provided by the teacher to ensure alignment with a Christian worldview."
