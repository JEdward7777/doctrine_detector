Grade: 60

Comments: The student's answer provides some thoughtful suggestions for modern Christian practices inspired by the concept of ritual cleanliness in the Old Testament. However, there are several key doctrinal gaps in the response. The student misses the opportunity to directly tie these modern practices back to foundational Old Testament teachings on ritual purity and cleanliness. The emphasis on personal reflection, ethical consumption, and cultural inclusivity, while positive, does not fully capture the essence of ritual cleanliness as understood in the Old Testament context. Additionally, there is a lack of focus on the sacrificial and atoning aspects of ritual cleanliness that find fulfillment in Jesus Christ within Christian theology. The student's answer would benefit from more direct biblical references and a clearer connection to Christian doctrine on ritual purity.
