  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response lacks doctrinal accuracy and is overly focused on cultural and critical interpretations rather than presenting a Christian worldview. The theological significance of humans being compared to sheep in the Bible primarily emphasizes the themes of dependence, guidance, protection, and the need for a shepherd (God). The response does not adequately address the primary biblical teachings on this comparison. To improve, the student should focus more on presenting traditional Christian interpretations and theological significance in relation to the biblical context."
