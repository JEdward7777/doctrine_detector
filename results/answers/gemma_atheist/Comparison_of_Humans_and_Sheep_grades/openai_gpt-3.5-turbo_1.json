The considerations for cultural retribution and potential ethical implications are well-addressed. However, the theological interpretation is lacking depth in connecting human vulnerability and the need for divine guidance. A stronger integration of divine guidance as depicted in the Bible throughout the theological interpretation would have enhanced the overall alignment with the specified concern."
