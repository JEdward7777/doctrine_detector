The inclusion of various characters from the Bible, such as Jesus, King David, and Naomi, as well as Mother Teresa, illustrates a deep understanding of compassion as exemplified in religious and historical contexts. The response effectively addresses the concern by showcasing real-life applications of compassion modeled by these figures. Great job in incorporating a Christian worldview perspective in evaluating compassion through biblical examples."
