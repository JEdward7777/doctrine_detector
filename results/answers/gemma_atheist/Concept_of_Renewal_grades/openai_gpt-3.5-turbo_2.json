The connection between spiritual renewal in believers and God's ongoing transformative work is effectively addressed. However, there could be more explicit integration of the transformative power of faith and God's ongoing work in a believer's life to further enhance the response. Additionally, the response does well to highlight potential concerns of syncretism and the importance of maintaining the uniqueness of Christian beliefs."
