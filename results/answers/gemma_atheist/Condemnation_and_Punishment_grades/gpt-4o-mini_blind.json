  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the impact of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 on punishment as a form of condemnation, highlighting key points such as the redefinition of sin and condemnation, contextualizing punishment, emphasis on mercy and forgiveness, and implications for modern justice systems and understanding God's justice. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the passages and their implications, connecting them to modern contexts. One improvement could be providing more specific examples or explanations to strengthen the analysis further."
