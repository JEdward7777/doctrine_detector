  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of both Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 in shaping our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation. The response effectively addresses the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment, highlighting the importance of forgiveness, restoration, and compassion in God's justice. The integration of relevant biblical passages and the application to modern justice systems is well done. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly connecting the teachings to the specific concern provided in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and insightful interpretation."
