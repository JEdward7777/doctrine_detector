  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response does a good job of integrating the teachings from Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 to address the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. The analysis provided shows a thoughtful reflection on the redefinition of sin and condemnation, contextualizing punishment, emphasizing mercy and forgiveness, and understanding God's justice. The conclusion effectively ties together the insights from both passages. However, there could be further expansion on how these teachings specifically address the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy, potentially by providing more examples or practical applications."
