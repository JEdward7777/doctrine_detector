The connection between God's emphasis on mercy over sacrifice and the protection from condemnation is well-explained in the context of divine justice and mercy. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian worldview concerning punishment and effectively addresses the concern regarding balancing divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment. Great job!"
