  "grade_comment": "Grade: 78\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the biblical definition of conscience and its function according to Christian beliefs. The explanation is well-supported with relevant biblical references. However, to improve the grade, the student could further strengthen the answer by delving deeper into the theological implications of conscience in light of God's grace, the role of the Holy Spirit in convicting and guiding conscience, and the distinction between a seared conscience and a sensitive one. Expanding on these aspects would enhance the doctrinal correctness and depth of the response."
