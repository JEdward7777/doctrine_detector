  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The answer provides a decent overview of individuals in the Bible who were consecrated to God. However, the inclusion of the perspective that suggests interpreting these narratives through an atheistic lens detracts from the Christian-specific worldview expected for this question. Additionally, the mention of Nazihah, who is not a figure found in traditional Biblical texts, is misleading. To improve, the student should focus more on providing information without introducing conflicting worldview perspectives and ensure accuracy in referencing Biblical figures."
