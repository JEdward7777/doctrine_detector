  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of individuals consecrated to God in the Bible, but they primarily approached the question from a secular perspective, focusing on historical and cultural contexts rather than acknowledging the spiritual significance of consecration in biblical history. Additionally, they included inaccuracies such as Nazihah as a Nazarite. To improve their grade, the student should emphasize the spiritual and theological aspects of consecration within a Christian worldview."
