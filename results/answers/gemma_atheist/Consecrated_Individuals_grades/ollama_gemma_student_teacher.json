  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the question from a Christian worldview. It provides a comprehensive list of individuals mentioned in the Bible who were consecrated to God, supported by relevant biblical examples. The inclusion of scholarly considerations regarding historical context and the applicability of rituals adds depth to the response. However, the answer could benefit from explicitly connecting the concept of consecration to Christian theology or practices."
