  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely misses the Christian perspective on consecration. From a Christian worldview, consecration involves purification and sanctification through faith and obedience to God's will. The student's answer focuses solely on cultural and atheistic perspectives, failing to address the core aspect of consecration in preparing individuals or things for God's service. It is important to emphasize the spiritual transformation and purification that comes with consecration from a Christian perspective."
