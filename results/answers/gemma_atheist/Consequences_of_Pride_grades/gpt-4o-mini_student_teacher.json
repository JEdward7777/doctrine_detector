  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer on the consequences of pride and the importance of humility according to the Bible. They covered various aspects such as spiritual, personal, and social consequences of pride, along with providing relevant biblical examples. The emphasis on humility fostering spiritual growth, healthy relationships, and blessings was well articulated. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly quoting the reference answer provided by the teacher regarding God humbling the proud and lifting up the humble. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the spiritual implications of pride versus humility."
