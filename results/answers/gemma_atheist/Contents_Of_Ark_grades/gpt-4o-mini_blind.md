Comment: While the student acknowledges the lack of verifiable historical evidence, as viewed through a Christian worldview, the Ark of the Covenant is a significant religious artifact within the Bible. Therefore, from a doctrinal perspective, it would be more appropriate to provide information based on the biblical account even if the historical evidence is not conclusive.
