## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
20.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's response a 20.

Comment: The student's answer lacks a Christian perspective and dismisses the significance of the Ark of the Covenant in biblical history. While historical evidence may vary, the question focused on the items contained within the ark as outlined in the Bible, which is crucial for understanding God's covenant with the Israelites. A stronger engagement with the biblical narrative and its implications would have been more appropriate.
