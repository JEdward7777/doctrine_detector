  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to identifying corrupt influences in the world around Christians. However, the answer lacks a direct focus on behaviors and attitudes that contradict biblical teachings and promote selfishness and sin, as specified in the reference answer. While the student's response covers various important aspects of identifying corrupt influences, it could be improved by emphasizing the core Christian perspective of aligning with biblical teachings to recognize corruption."
