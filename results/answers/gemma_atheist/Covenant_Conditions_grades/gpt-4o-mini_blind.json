  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a generally accurate overview of unconditional and conditional covenants in the Bible. They correctly identify key examples of each type of covenant and explain them well. However, there are a few areas for improvement. The mention of interpretations potentially making conditional covenants effectively unconditional is somewhat confusing and could be clarified. Additionally, the mention of an \"atheological perspective\" at the end does not align well with a Christian worldview, as it suggests a viewpoint that denies the existence of God. This could be omitted or phrased differently to avoid confusion."
