The example provided is a good start, but it could be developed further to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the biblical concepts.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more specific examples and analysis of how God's promises and expectations work together in different covenants. Additionally, exploring the cultural context and historical background of each covenant would add depth and nuance to the discussion."
