  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of unconditional and conditional covenants in the Bible, supported with relevant examples. The mention of the covenant at Sinai aligns well with the concern about understanding God's promises and expectations in covenants. However, there could be further elaboration on how God's promises and expectations interact within these covenants from a Christian worldview. Additionally, connecting the examples given in the main response with the example provided in the answer could strengthen the overall coherence of the explanation."
