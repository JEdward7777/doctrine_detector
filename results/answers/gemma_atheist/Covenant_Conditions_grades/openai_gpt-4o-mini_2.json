  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the concepts of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, using specific examples and references to relevant biblical passages. The concern regarding understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants is addressed well, providing a clear comparison between unconditional and conditional covenants. The response could be enhanced by elaborating further on the theological significance and implications of these covenants within a Christian worldview."
