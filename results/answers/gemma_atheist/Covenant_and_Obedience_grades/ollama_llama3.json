While it is true that obedience was required as part of the covenant, the response does not account for the various perspectives and cultural contexts discussed in the original text. A more comprehensive understanding would require considering the symbolic, ethical, and social control aspects of God's laws, as well as the differing views on divine intervention and human factors."
