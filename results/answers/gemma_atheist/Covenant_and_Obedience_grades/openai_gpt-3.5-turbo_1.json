It acknowledges the importance of obedience to God's commandments in achieving His promises, and presents both traditional and critical views on the matter. The response effectively considers the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel. However, the critical scholars' perspective that attributes the Israelites' success solely to human factors could potentially undermine the significance of divine intervention in fulfilling God's promises. This response could be further enhanced by emphasizing the sovereignty of God and His role in guiding the Israelites through their journey."
