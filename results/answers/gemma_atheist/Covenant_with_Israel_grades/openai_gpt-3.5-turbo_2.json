While it presents arguments based on historical and archaeological evidence, it dismisses the spiritual and theological dimensions of the covenant. In a Christian worldview, understanding and respecting God's promises and relationship with His chosen people is essential, and this perspective fails to address the spiritual aspect of the covenant."
