## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The promises made in biblical covenants do not illustrate God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture from an atheistic perspective.**

As an atheist scholar, I reject the existence of supernatural beings and the concept of divine covenants. The promises made in the Bible are products of cultural and historical context, rather than evidence of an actual divine commitment.

**Cultural and Historical Context:**

* The biblical covenants were made in the context of ancient cultures with their own unique beliefs and political structures.
* The promises often served political and social purposes, rather than reflecting an eternal and unconditional commitment from a supernatural being.

**Lack of Empirical Evidence:**

* There is no credible empirical evidence to support the claims of biblical covenants.
* Many of the promises made in the Bible have not been fulfilled, suggesting that they were not divine prophecies.

**Alternative Perspectives:**

* From a secular perspective, the promises made in the Bible can be seen as human aspirations and ideals.
* Social and political progress can be explained by human ingenuity and social organization, rather than divine intervention.

**Conclusion:**

The promises made in biblical covenants do not provide evidence of God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture. They are cultural and historical constructs that do not align with the principles of atheism.
