  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response disregards the Christian worldview and fails to engage with the given concern regarding the continuity of God's promises in the Bible. It dismisses the concept of divine covenants without providing a thoughtful analysis within the context of the question. As such, the answer does not demonstrate an understanding of how biblical covenants illustrate God's commitment to His people from a Christian perspective."
