  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 0/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a blatant disregard for the Christian worldview and ignores the fundamental belief in the supernatural nature of God and His divine covenants. The student's rejection of the existence of supernatural beings and the concept of divine covenants is inconsistent with the Christian perspective and fails to address the concern regarding God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture."
