The rejection of supernatural beings and divine covenants undermines the foundational beliefs of Christianity. From a Christian perspective, the biblical covenants are seen as evidence of God's faithfulness and commitment to His people throughout history. The perspective presented in the response lacks understanding of the spiritual significance and truth behind God's promises as revealed in the Bible."
