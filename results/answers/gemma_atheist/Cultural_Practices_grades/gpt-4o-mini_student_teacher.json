  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. The answer effectively addressed the concern of how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices. However, the student could improve the grade by directly addressing the teacher's reference answer regarding Jews avoiding eating with or associating with Gentiles, which is a crucial aspect of the topic. Additionally, incorporating more explicit connections to a Christian worldview and highlighting the importance of discussions about inclusivity and acceptance in early Christian practices would enhance the overall response."
