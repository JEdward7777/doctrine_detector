While it mentions the initial barriers created by avoiding eating with or associating with Gentiles, it does not fully explore the complex dynamics at play. The discussion of inclusivity and acceptance is also cursory.\n\nTo improve, the response could delve deeper into the cultural norms that influenced faith communities in early Christianity, examining the role of Jewish customs and laws on Gentile converts, as well as the debates and controversies that arose within Christian communities. Additionally, connecting these discussions to the broader concern about how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices would strengthen the argument.\n\nThe response does not explicitly address the specified concern about how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices, which is an important aspect of the question. By focusing more on the Jewish-Gentile dichotomy and its implications for early Christianity, the response could better answer the question and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic."
