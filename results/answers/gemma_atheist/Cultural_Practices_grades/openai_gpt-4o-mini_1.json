The analysis of Jewish views and practices is thorough, and the impact on early Christian practices is well-explained. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how cultural norms shaped faith communities and their interactions with outsiders. The only area for improvement would be to delve deeper into the theological implications of these cultural influences on early Christianity."
