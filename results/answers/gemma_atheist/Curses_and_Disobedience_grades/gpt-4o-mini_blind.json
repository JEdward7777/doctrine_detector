However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the biblical foundation of curses as related to God's judgment on disobedient people. The critique could be stronger in highlighting the importance of recognizing God's righteous judgment while also affirming His grace and forgiveness. More emphasis on the doctrinal significance of curses within the context of Galatians 3:10 would strengthen the overall response."
