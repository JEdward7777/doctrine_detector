  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer strays from a Christian-specific worldview and fails to address the significance of the snake's curse in relation to sin and redemption as indicated in the question. The response focuses more on cultural, evolutionary, and ethical perspectives rather than exploring the theological implications of the curse in Genesis 3:14. Encouragement to incorporate biblical teachings on sin, redemption, and the relationship between humanity and God would significantly strengthen the answer."
