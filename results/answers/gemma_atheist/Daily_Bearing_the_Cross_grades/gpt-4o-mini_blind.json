The absence of a clear emphasis on the sacrificial aspect of following Christ, the centrality of Christ's atonement on the cross, and the call to die to self aligning with Christ's teachings detracts from doctrinal correctness. The response is weakened by the inclusion of an atheistic scholarly perspective which doesn't contribute to a firm understanding of the biblical concept. Encouragement to deepen the analysis through a more focused Christian lens is advisable."
