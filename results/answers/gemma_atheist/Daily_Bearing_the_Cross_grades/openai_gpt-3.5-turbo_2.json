The analysis of the cultural context and possible interpretations enriches the understanding of the concept, although from a secular perspective. Incorporating a Christian worldview and highlighting the redemptive aspect of suffering and the parallel to Jesus' sacrifice could have further emphasized the significance of taking up one's cross in a Christian context."
