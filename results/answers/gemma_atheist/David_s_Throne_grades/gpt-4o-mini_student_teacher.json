  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-written explanation of the promise of David's throne lasting forever in Christian theology. They effectively supported their points with biblical interpretation and cultural context. However, the student's answer could have been more focused on the specific concern provided, which is recognizing the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus. The reference answer directly addresses this concern by emphasizing that Jesus, as David's descendant, will reign as king forever, symbolizing God's eternal covenant and sovereignty. The student's answer, while informative, did not explicitly tie the promise of David's throne to the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus in the same clear manner as the reference answer."
