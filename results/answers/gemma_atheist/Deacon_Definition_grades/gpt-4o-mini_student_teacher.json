  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the various roles and responsibilities of a deacon in the local church, the primary biblical role of servanthood is not emphasized adequately. The biblical role of a deacon is primarily about serving others in practical ways, such as helping with practical needs like food or money, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer covers a wide range of responsibilities but lacks a clear focus on the foundational aspect of servanthood in the biblical context."
