  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the provided response correctly identifies one aspect of a deacon's role in serving fellow believers with practical needs, it falls short of fully understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. The response omits key aspects such as outreach, community engagement, pastoral care, administration, communication, and advocacy which are crucial in demonstrating servanthood in a comprehensive way as outlined in the detailed response. Encouraging the student to deepen their understanding of the multi-faceted responsibilities of a deacon within the biblical context of servanthood."
