  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response acknowledges that it cannot provide interpretations or definitions related to religious texts or doctrines, which shows an awareness of its limitations. However, it does not address the concern of understanding the Biblical definition and implications of adultery. Since the response does not engage with the specific concern or provide any insight into the Christian understanding of adultery, the grade is relatively low."
