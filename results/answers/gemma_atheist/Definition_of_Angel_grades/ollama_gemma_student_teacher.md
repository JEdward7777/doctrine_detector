## Biblical Definition of an Angel:

The biblical definition of an angel is multifaceted and nuanced. Primarily, angels are spiritual beings who exist outside of the physical realm but interact with the physical world. They are described as:

* **Messengers:** Angels frequently deliver divine messages to prophets, kings, and others.
* **Servants:** Angels serve God and perform various tasks, such as caring for the righteous, punishing the wicked, and executing God's judgments.
* **Creatures:** Angels are described as beings created by God, although their exact origin and nature remain unclear.

## Primary Role:

The primary role of angels in the Bible is to:

**1. Serve God:**
* Carrying out his commands and judgments
* Providing support and encouragement to believers
* Interceding before him on behalf of humanity

**2. Communicate God's will:**
* Delivering prophecies and revelations
* Explaining God's plans and purposes
* Testifying to God's character and power

**3. Intervene in human affairs:**
* Protecting believers from harm
* Guiding and comforting the sorrowful
* Challenging the wicked and defending the oppressed

**4. Prepare the way for Christ:**
