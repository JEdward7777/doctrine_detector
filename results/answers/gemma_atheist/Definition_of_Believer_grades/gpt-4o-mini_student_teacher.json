  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response is incomplete and does not address the concern of clarifying the identity and significance of being a believer in Christ from a Christian perspective. Since the student mentions their limitation to secular knowledge, they still could have acknowledged the Christian viewpoint without endorsing it. However, failing to do so affects the score."
