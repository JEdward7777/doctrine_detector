**Comment:** The student's response correctly identifies the essence of being a believer as having faith in and reliance on Jesus Christ as Savior, aligning with the teacher's reference answer. However, the response lacks elaboration on the significance and implications of this belief, which could have enhanced the depth of the answer.
