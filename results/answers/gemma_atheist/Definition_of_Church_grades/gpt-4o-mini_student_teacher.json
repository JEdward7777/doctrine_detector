  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the term \"church\" in the New Testament, emphasizing the community of believers empowered by the Holy Spirit. The inclusion of biblical references, cultural context, and modern interpretation provides a comprehensive explanation. The only minor deviation from the reference answer is the emphasis on the spiritual nature of the church, which may slightly overlook the aspect of believers meeting together physically. Overall, a well-reasoned and well-supported response."
