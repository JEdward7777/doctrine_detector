The inclusion of an \"atheological perspective\" and emphasis on cultural considerations without anchoring the discussion in the biblical understanding of confession detracts from the doctrinal correctness required in a response from a Christian worldview. The response would benefit from a clearer focus on the biblical understanding of confession as outlined in Scripture."
