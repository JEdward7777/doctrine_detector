  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the literal meaning of the term 'evangelist', which is \"one who brings good news\". It also correctly explains the origin of the term from the Greek words 'eva' and 'angelo'. However, the response does not fully address the concern of understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel. The phrase \"someone who preaches the good news\" implies that an evangelist's primary task is to convey information, rather than to share the Good News of Jesus Christ as a call to conversion and discipleship.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more depth on what it means to be an evangelist in the context of sharing the gospel."
