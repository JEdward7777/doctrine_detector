  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of how the Bible defines God, highlighting important characteristics. However, the concern about understanding God's nature truthfully for proper worship and relationship is not directly addressed in the response. Therefore, while the content is informative and insightful, missing a direct connection to the concern lowers the grade slightly."
