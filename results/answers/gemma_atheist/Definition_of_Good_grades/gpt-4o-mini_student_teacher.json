  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-analyzed response to the question, showcasing a depth of understanding in contrasting the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil'. They have effectively addressed the concern of understanding the moral implications of these concepts in daily decision-making. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by focusing more on the specific Christian worldview perspective in evaluating 'good' and 'evil' rather than general cultural and historical contexts. Nonetheless, their analysis is thoughtful and insightful."
