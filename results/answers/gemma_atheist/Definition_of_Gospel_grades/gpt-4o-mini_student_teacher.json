  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the literal meaning of 'gospel' and provided a comprehensive overview of its biblical significance. They discussed key aspects such as salvation, good news, universal offer, and transformative power, showing a depth of knowledge. However, the student's statement at the end, where they mention their atheistic perspective and analyze the gospel as a cultural artifact, detracts from the Christian worldview-based answer required for the concern. In a Christian-specific context, it is important to maintain a focus on the religious significance and interpretation of the gospel."
