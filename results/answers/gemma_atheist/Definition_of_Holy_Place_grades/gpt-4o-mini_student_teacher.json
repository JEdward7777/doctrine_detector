  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the cultural and historical significance of the 'holy place' in ancient tabernacles and temples. However, the student did not directly address the concern of understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place as specified. The reference answer emphasizes the 'holy place' as a space set apart for God's presence, which is crucial from a Christian worldview. The student's answer, while informative, lacks a specific focus on God's dwelling place, resulting in a lower grade."
