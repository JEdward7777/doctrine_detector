It effectively contextualizes the importance of the 'holy place' within the broader understanding of the structure and function of God's dwelling place. The response could be strengthened by directly connecting these insights to the core Christian belief that God's presence dwells in the 'holy place' and emphasizing the theological significance of this space in facilitating communion with the divine."
