  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: The response completely missed the mark on explaining repentance according to the Bible from a Christian worldview perspective. It failed to address the biblical definition of repentance as a turning away from sin towards God, with genuine remorse, confession, and a change of heart. The focus on cultural relativism and societal norms detracted from the essential biblical teachings on repentance. The student should make sure to emphasize biblical accuracy and avoid diluting the message with secular perspectives."
