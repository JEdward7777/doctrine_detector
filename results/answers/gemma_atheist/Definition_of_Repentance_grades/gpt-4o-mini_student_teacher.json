  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response veers off course by focusing on a cultural perspective rather than providing a direct and accurate biblical definition of repentance. While acknowledging cultural context can be valuable in understanding biblical concepts, the student fails to address the specific concern of defining repentance according to the Bible. Their response lacks clarity and depth in articulating the biblical understanding of repentance as turning away from sin and turning back to God. This deviation results in a low grade as the answer does not fulfill the fundamental requirement of the question."
