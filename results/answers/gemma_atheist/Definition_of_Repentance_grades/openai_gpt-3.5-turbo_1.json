While it acknowledges the traditional interpretation, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about fostering genuine spiritual growth. The focus on cultural diversity somewhat dilutes the importance of understanding repentance in a biblical context for spiritual transformation. The response would benefit from a stronger connection to the specific concern provided."
