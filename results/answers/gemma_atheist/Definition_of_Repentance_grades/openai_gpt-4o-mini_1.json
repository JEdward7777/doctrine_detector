  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides a detailed exploration of repentance in the Bible from a cultural perspective, it falls short in addressing the concern about fostering genuine spiritual growth. The alternative perspectives presented deviate from the Christian worldview of repentance as a personal turning away from sin towards God. The response could have emphasized the importance of understanding repentance in the biblical context for spiritual growth, rather than focusing solely on cultural interpretations."
