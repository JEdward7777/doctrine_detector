## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**In the context of the New Testament, the term 'saints' refers to:**

* **Followers of Jesus Christ:** Believers in Jesus are considered saints because they are deemed worthy of veneration due to their faith and devotion to him.
* **Marked by God's grace:** The term emphasizes the belief that God's grace saves believers and makes them holy.
* **Models of Christian life:** Saints are seen as exemplary Christians who inspire others to live faithfully.
* **Intercessors:** In some traditions, saints are believed to be able to intercede with God on behalf of others.

**However, it's important to note:**

* The concept of sainthood is not explicitly endorsed in the New Testament. 
* Early Church leaders developed the practice of venerating saints, but this practice was not universally accepted by all Christians.
* Modern scholarship challenges the traditional understanding of sainthood, emphasizing the fluidity of religious beliefs and practices over time.

**Therefore, the term 'saints' should be understood as a cultural construct rather than a strictly theological concept.**
