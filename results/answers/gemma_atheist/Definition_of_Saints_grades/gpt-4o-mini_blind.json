  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of the term \"saints\" in the context of the New Testament, highlighting key aspects such as followers of Jesus, recipients of God's grace, models of Christian life, and even intercessors in some traditions. The student also appropriately acknowledges the historical development of the concept of sainthood within the Church and the diverse interpretations surrounding it. The explanation could be improved by emphasizing the biblical basis for sainthood in the New Testament, as well as discussing the scriptural references that support these understandings. Additionally, while mentioning modern scholarship challenging traditional beliefs is relevant, the response could benefit from clearer integration of how this challenges or complements the biblical understanding of saints."
