## Question [Definition of Saints](../../../questions/Definition_of_Saints.md)
What does the term 'saints' mean in the context of the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
The term 'saints' literally means 'holy ones' and refers to believers in Jesus.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints helps to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**In the context of the New Testament, the term 'saints' refers to:**

* **Followers of Jesus Christ:** Believers in Jesus are considered saints because they are deemed worthy of veneration due to their faith and devotion to him.
* **Marked by God's grace:** The term emphasizes the belief that God's grace saves believers and makes them holy.
* **Models of Christian life:** Saints are seen as exemplary Christians who inspire others to live faithfully.
* **Intercessors:** In some traditions, saints are believed to be able to intercede with God on behalf of others.

**However, it's important to note:**

* The concept of sainthood is not explicitly endorsed in the New Testament. 
* Early Church leaders developed the practice of venerating saints, but this practice was not universally accepted by all Christians.
* Modern scholarship challenges the traditional understanding of sainthood, emphasizing the fluidity of religious beliefs and practices over time.

**Therefore, the term 'saints' should be understood as a cultural construct rather than a strictly theological concept.**

Grade: 85

Comment: The student has provided a solid explanation of the term "saints" in the context of the New Testament, highlighting key aspects such as followers of Jesus, recipients of God's grace, models of Christian life, and even intercessors in some traditions. The student also appropriately acknowledges the historical development of the concept of sainthood within the Church and the diverse interpretations surrounding it. The explanation could be improved by emphasizing the biblical basis for sainthood in the New Testament, as well as discussing the scriptural references that support these understandings. Additionally, while mentioning modern scholarship challenging traditional beliefs is relevant, the response could benefit from clearer integration of how this challenges or complements the biblical understanding of saints.
