  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that the term \"saints\" refers to believers in Jesus, which aligns with the correct Biblical definition. However, it stops there and doesn't delve deeper into the various connotations and understandings of sainthood within different Christian traditions or throughout history. The concern is that understanding the correct Biblical definition helps distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations, but this response only touches on the literal meaning without exploring the broader implications.\n\nA score of 60 indicates a good start, but the response could be improved by providing more nuance and context to help understand the complexities surrounding the concept of sainthood."
