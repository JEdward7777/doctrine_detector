It acknowledges the historical development of the concept of sainthood and modern scholarly perspectives. The answer aligns well with the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints. However, the response could have included more direct references to specific Bible verses or theological doctrines to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
