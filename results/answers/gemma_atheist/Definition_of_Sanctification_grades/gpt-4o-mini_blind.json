  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: \n\nWhile the student discusses the general concept of sanctification, there are key elements missing in their response. The student fails to explicitly mention the role of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit in the process of sanctification, which are foundational to Christian belief. Additionally, the student's mention of potential interpretations for atheists, while informative, is not directly relevant to the biblical concept of sanctification. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and could be improved by including more scriptural references and specifically outlining the Christian understanding of sanctification."
