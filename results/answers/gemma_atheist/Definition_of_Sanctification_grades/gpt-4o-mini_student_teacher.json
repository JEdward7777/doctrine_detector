  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provides some relevant information about sanctification, there is a lack of focus on the biblical definition provided by the teacher. The student's answer is overly focused on cultural considerations, interpretations for atheists, and implications for interpretation, straying away from the central Christian worldview understanding of sanctification as making holy or set apart. The response should have centered more on the biblical perspective and the process of being made holy according to Christian beliefs."
