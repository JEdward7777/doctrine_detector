However, it lacks depth in explaining the biblical definition of sanctification based on the given answer. The cultural considerations and potential interpretations for atheists are interesting points, but they somewhat deviate from the primary concern of understanding the biblical definition. More focus on explaining how the biblical definition relates to the concept of sanctification would enhance the response."
