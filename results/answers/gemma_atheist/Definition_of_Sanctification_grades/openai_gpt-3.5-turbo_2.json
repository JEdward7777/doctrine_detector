However, there is a lack of direct correlation to the biblical definition provided, which could have been more clearly emphasized throughout the response. Additionally, while the cultural considerations and potential interpretations for atheists are informative, they somewhat dilute the focus on the biblical definition of sanctification. Overall, the response is clear and well-written but could benefit from a stronger connection to the specific biblical understanding of sanctification."
