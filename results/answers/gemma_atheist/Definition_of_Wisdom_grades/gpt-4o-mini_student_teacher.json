  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that delved into various aspects of biblical wisdom. However, there is a concern with the response not directly aligning with the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the student's answer offers valuable insights on the multifaceted nature of biblical wisdom, it lacks conciseness and simplicity, which may make it challenging for individuals to grasp the core essence of biblical wisdom as described by the reference answer. The student's response also touches upon secular perspectives and universal values, which could potentially dilute the focus on the specifically biblical definition of wisdom. A clearer alignment with the teacher's reference answer and a more concise presentation could significantly enhance the student's grade in this context."
