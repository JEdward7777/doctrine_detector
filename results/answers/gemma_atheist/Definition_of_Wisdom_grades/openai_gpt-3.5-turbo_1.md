**According to the biblical definition of wisdom, it is the ability to discern and apply divine principles to practical situations.** 

The Bible paints a multifaceted portrait of wisdom, highlighting various aspects crucial for living a righteous life:

**1. Understanding God's Character:**

- Wisdom begins with recognizing God as the ultimate source of knowledge and wisdom (Proverbs 2:3-6).
- Understanding God's character, laws, and purposes guides our decisions and actions.

**2. Fear of the Lord:**

- The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 1:7).
- This reverence for God motivates us to obey his commands and live for his glory.

**3. Ethical Virtue:**

- Wisdom involves living a life of integrity, justice, and mercy (Proverbs 12:13).
- It entails making ethical decisions that align with God's values.

**4. Practical Knowledge:**

- The Bible emphasizes practical wisdom that leads to physical and spiritual well-being (Proverbs 3:13).
- This includes skills for managing finances, resolving conflicts, and navigating social situations.

**5. Balanced Judgment:**

- Wisdom involves discerning between right and wrong, and making balanced judgments (Proverbs 15:23).
- It requires an ability to consider all perspectives and weigh evidence before making a decision.

**6. Reverence and Humility:**

- True wisdom recognizes our limitations and dependence on God (James 3:5).
- It involves humility, acknowledging God's authority, and seeking his guidance.

**For an atheistic scholar who values cultural sensitivity, this definition of wisdom transcends religious boundaries and resonates with universal human values.** It emphasizes:

- Ethical decision-making based on reason and compassion
- Understanding and respecting diverse perspectives
- Practical skills for navigating life's challenges
- Recognizing the importance of personal growth and reflection

**Therefore, approaching wisdom from a biblical perspective can provide valuable insights for living a fulfilling life, regardless of one's religious beliefs or cultural background.**
