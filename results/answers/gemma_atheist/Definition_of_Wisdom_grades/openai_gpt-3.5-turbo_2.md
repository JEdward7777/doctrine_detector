The Bible paints a multifaceted portrait of wisdom, highlighting various aspects crucial for living a righteous life:

**1. Understanding God's Character:**

- Wisdom begins with recognizing God as the ultimate source of knowledge and wisdom (Proverbs 2:3-6).
- Understanding God's character, laws, and purposes guides our decisions and actions.

**2. Fear of the Lord:**

- The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 1:7).
- This reverence for God motivates us to obey his commands and live for his glory.

**3. Ethical Virtue:**

- Wisdom involves living a life of integrity, justice, and mercy (Proverbs 12:13).
- It entails making ethical decisions that align with God's values.

**6. Reverence and Humility:**

- True wisdom recognizes our limitations and dependence on God (James 3:5).
