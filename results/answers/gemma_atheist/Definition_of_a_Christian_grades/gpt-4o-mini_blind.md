## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Christian.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The biblical definition of a "Christian" is not explicitly stated in the scriptures. However, it can be understood as those who adhere to the teachings of Jesus Christ, who claimed to be the Son of God and the Savior of humanity. This definition emphasizes the central belief of Christianity: the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ.

**Biblical references often associated with the term "Christian":**

* **Acts 11:26:** "Then the Apostle Peter remembered the words of Jesus, that he said, 'Everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.'"
* **1 Peter 4:17:** "For you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, people whom God desires to show his approval."
* **Revelation 1:9:** "I am writing to the seven churches in the province of Asia: I am the faithful witness of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate."

These passages highlight the core beliefs of Christianity: faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, forgiveness of sins through his sacrifice, and the transformation of lives through his teachings.
