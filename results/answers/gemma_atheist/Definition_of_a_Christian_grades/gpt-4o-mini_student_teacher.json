  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation supported by relevant biblical references which align well with the teacher's reference answer. The understanding of Christians as those who adhere to the teachings of Jesus Christ and emphasis on faith in Jesus as the Savior is accurate and well-explained. Some minor deductions could occur due to the lack of a direct quotation of the reference answer or a slight deviation in wording, but overall the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical definition of a Christian."
