However, it can be understood as those who adhere to the teachings of Jesus Christ, who claimed to be the Son of God and the Savior of humanity. This definition emphasizes the central belief of Christianity: the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ.

**Biblical references often associated with the term "Christian":**
