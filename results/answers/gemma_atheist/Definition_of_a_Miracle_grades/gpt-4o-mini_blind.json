It is important to emphasize the supernatural nature of miracles as divine interventions that demonstrate God's authority over the natural world. The student should have connected the concept of miracles more explicitly to God's sovereignty and power as revealed in the Bible. Additionally, the answer could have benefited from a clearer articulation of how miracles, in the Christian worldview, serve to validate and affirm God's authority."
