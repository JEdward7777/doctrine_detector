  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive exploration of the concept of miracles within cultural contexts and different interpretations, which is commendable. However, the answer lacks a clear connection to God's authority as the primary source of miracles, as highlighted in the reference answer. While the student's analysis is insightful, it falls short of emphasizing the foundational Christian belief that miracles are extraordinary events attributed to God's direct intervention, demonstrating His ultimate power and authority over all creation."
