  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: The response provided raises valid points about the diverse interpretations and cultural contexts surrounding miracles. However, it falls short in addressing the concern specifically from a Christian worldview, as it does not directly align with the given answer emphasizing God's intervention and power in defining miracles. A Christian-specific perspective on miracles would emphasize the direct involvement of God in these extraordinary events, demonstrating His authority and power over creation. The response could be improved by integrating these core Christian beliefs more prominently in the discussion."
