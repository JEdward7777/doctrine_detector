However, it does not fully align with a Christian worldview as it does not strongly emphasize the central idea that miracles are manifestations of God's power and authority. While the cultural and psychological aspects are important to consider, a stronger emphasis on the supernatural and divine intervention would have been more in line with the specified concern of understanding miracles deepening faith in God's power."
