  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of the Biblical understanding of demon possession, citing relevant passages and discussing cultural influences. However, the analysis lacks doctrinal depth and fails to emphasize the spiritual warfare aspect of demon possession as depicted in the Bible. Additionally, there is a tendency towards secular academic interpretations over a solidly Christian worldview. The response could be improved by highlighting the authority of Scripture in shaping our understanding of demon possession and emphasizing Jesus's ultimate power over demonic forces."
