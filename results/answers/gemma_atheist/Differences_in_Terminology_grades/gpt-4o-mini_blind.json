  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and concise explanation of the key differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish'. The definitions are accurate and demonstrate a good understanding of the nuances in usage. The inclusion of examples enhances the explanation. From a Christian worldview, it would have been beneficial to incorporate how these terms align with biblical teachings on accountability, support, and correction. Overall, a solid response with room for improvement in incorporating a Christian perspective."
