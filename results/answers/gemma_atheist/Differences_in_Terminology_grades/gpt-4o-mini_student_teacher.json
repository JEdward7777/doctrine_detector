  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the key differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish', considering factors such as context, tone, and the relationship between the speaker and listener. However, from a Christian worldview, there is an emphasis on correcting wrong behavior and warning against sin in admonishment, which the student did not explicitly address. Encouragement in Scripture is often tied to motivating believers in their faith journey and guiding them towards righteousness. The student's response could further strengthen by incorporating this aspect of admonishment according to a Christian perspective."
