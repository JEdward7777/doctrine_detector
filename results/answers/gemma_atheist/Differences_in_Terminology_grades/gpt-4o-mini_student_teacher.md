## Key Differences Between 'Exhort', 'Encourage', and 'Admonish':

**Exhort:**

* Emphasizes urging or commanding someone to do something.
* Often carries a sense of duty, obligation, or righteousness.
* May be authoritative or persuasive, but often leans towards the former.
* Example: "The general exhorted his soldiers to fight bravely for their country."


**Encourage:**

* Focuses on boosting someone's confidence or motivation.
* Implies a positive response to someone's efforts or abilities.
* More positive and supportive in tone.
* Example: "The coach encouraged the team to play their best and support each other."


**Admonish:**

* Highlights the need to correct or improve behavior.
* Often implies disapproval or blame for past behavior.
* Uses a negative or cautionary tone.
* Example: "The principal admonished the students for their disruptive behavior in class."


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Context and tone:** The appropriate term depends on the specific context and desired tone. 
* **Relationship between the speaker and listener:** The hierarchical or familial relationship between the individuals influences the appropriate word choice.
* **Desired outcome:** The intended effect of the communication determines which term is most suitable.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the key differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish', considering factors such as context, tone, and the relationship between the speaker and listener. However, from a Christian worldview, there is an emphasis on correcting wrong behavior and warning against sin in admonishment, which the student did not explicitly address. Encouragement in Scripture is often tied to motivating believers in their faith journey and guiding them towards righteousness. The student's response could further strengthen by incorporating this aspect of admonishment according to a Christian perspective.
