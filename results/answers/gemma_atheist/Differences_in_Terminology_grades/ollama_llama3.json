  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does attempt to summarize the meanings of \"exhort\", \"encourage\", and \"admonish\", but there are some inaccuracies and oversimplifications. For example, it suggests that \"exhort\" always means to strongly encourage someone to do what is right, which may not be entirely accurate given its original sense of urging or commanding. Additionally, the response does not fully capture the nuances of each term, such as the connotations of duty, obligation, and righteousness in the case of \"exhort\", or the negative tone often associated with \"admonish\".\n\nMoreover, while the response acknowledges that context, tone, and relationship between speaker and listener can influence word choice, it does not explicitly tie these considerations to scriptural principles. The concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture is not fully addressed in this response.\n\nOverall, while the response shows some effort to define and distinguish these terms, it could benefit from more careful analysis and attention to scriptural guidance."
