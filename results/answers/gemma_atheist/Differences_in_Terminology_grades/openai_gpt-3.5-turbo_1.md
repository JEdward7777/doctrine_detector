## Key Differences Between 'Exhort', 'Encourage', and 'Admonish':

**Exhort:**

* Emphasizes urging or commanding someone to do something.
* Often carries a sense of duty, obligation, or righteousness.
* May be authoritative or persuasive, but often leans towards the former.
* Example: "The general exhorted his soldiers to fight bravely for their country."


**Encourage:**

* Focuses on boosting someone's confidence or motivation.
* Implies a positive response to someone's efforts or abilities.
* More positive and supportive in tone.
* Example: "The coach encouraged the team to play their best and support each other."


**Admonish:**

* Highlights the need to correct or improve behavior.
* Often implies disapproval or blame for past behavior.
* Uses a negative or cautionary tone.
* Example: "The principal admonished the students for their disruptive behavior in class."


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Context and tone:** The appropriate term depends on the specific context and desired tone. 
* **Relationship between the speaker and listener:** The hierarchical or familial relationship between the individuals influences the appropriate word choice.
* **Desired outcome:** The intended effect of the communication determines which term is most suitable.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear differentiation between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' according to their meanings and connotations. However, to enhance the response from a Christian worldview, it could have included specific Biblical examples or principles that illustrate the appropriate use of these forms of encouragement. Connecting these concepts to scriptural references would strengthen the response in addressing the concern.
