However, to fully address the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture from a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to incorporate specific biblical examples or principles that illustrate how these terms are utilized in the context of spiritual guidance and relationships. This additional depth would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the concept in the Christian perspective."
