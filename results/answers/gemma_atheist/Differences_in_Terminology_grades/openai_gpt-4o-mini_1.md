## Key Differences Between 'Exhort', 'Encourage', and 'Admonish':

**Exhort:**

* Emphasizes urging or commanding someone to do something.
* Often carries a sense of duty, obligation, or righteousness.

* Example: "The general exhorted his soldiers to fight bravely for their country."


**Encourage:**

* Focuses on boosting someone's confidence or motivation.
* Implies a positive response to someone's efforts or abilities.
* More positive and supportive in tone.
* Example: "The coach encouraged the team to play their best and support each other."


**Admonish:**

* Highlights the need to correct or improve behavior.
* Often implies disapproval or blame for past behavior.
* Uses a negative or cautionary tone.
* Example: "The principal admonished the students for their disruptive behavior in class."


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Context and tone:** The appropriate term depends on the specific context and desired tone. 
* **Relationship between the speaker and listener:** The hierarchical or familial relationship between the individuals influences the appropriate word choice.
* **Desired outcome:** The intended effect of the communication determines which term is most suitable.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of the key differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' in a general sense. However, to fully address the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture from a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to incorporate specific biblical examples or principles that illustrate how these terms are utilized in the context of spiritual guidance and relationships. This additional depth would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the concept in the Christian perspective.
