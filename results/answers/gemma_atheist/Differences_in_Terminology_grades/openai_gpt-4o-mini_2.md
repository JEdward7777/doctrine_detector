**Exhort:**

* Emphasizes urging or commanding someone to do something.

Comment: The response provides a good overview of the key differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish', aligning with the Christian worldview in emphasizing righteousness, positive support, and correction. It effectively addresses the concern by offering scripturally aligned meanings for each term. However, it could benefit from further elaboration on the scriptural basis or examples to strengthen the connection to Christian teachings.
