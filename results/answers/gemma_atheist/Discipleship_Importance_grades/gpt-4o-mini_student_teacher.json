  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that delves into various aspects of the selection of the twelve apostles, incorporating cultural, biblical, and possible factors into their analysis. However, the student's response lacks a clear emphasis on the central role of the apostles in spreading Jesus's teachings and establishing the early Church, which is the core significance of their selection according to the reference answer provided by the teacher.Aligning the student's analysis more closely with the central theme of the apostles' role in spreading Jesus's teachings would strengthen their response and improve the grade."
