  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise overview of the cultural, historical, and biblical context surrounding the selection of the twelve apostles. It highlights the significance of their unique call to spread Jesus' teachings and establish the foundation of the early Church. The response also touches on various factors that influenced Jesus' decision, such as loyalty, diversity, and spiritual potential.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are:\n\n* While the response provides a solid foundation, it could benefit from more specific examples or illustrations to further illustrate the significance of the apostles in the New Testament.\n* There is some repetition in the response, particularly in the section on possible factors that influenced Jesus' decision. Some consolidation and streamlining of ideas would help to make the response more concise and effective.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, and provides a solid foundation for further exploration and discussion."
