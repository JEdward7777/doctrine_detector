  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough analysis of the selection of the twelve apostles, incorporating cultural, biblical, and historical contexts. It effectively explains how the apostles were selected based on cultural norms, personal qualities, biblical accounts, possible factors, and cultural influences. The conclusion ties everything together well, emphasizing the significance of the apostles in the early Church. The only minor improvement could be a more explicit connection to the New Testament's role and significance of the apostles, but overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
