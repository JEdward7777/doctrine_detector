  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided insightful points regarding the semantic and cultural implications of translating 'Lord Yahweh' as 'Lord LORD.' However, the focus of the initial concern was on maintaining clarity to prevent misinterpretations concerning God's identity and authority. While the student's response touched on aspects of confusion and cultural sensitivity, the emphasis on these elements rather than directly addressing the concern of clarity lowers the grade slightly. The student could have strengthened their answer by explicitly connecting their points to the potential misinterpretations that may arise from using 'Lord LORD' instead of 'Lord Yahweh.'"
