  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights the importance of maintaining clarity in translations to prevent misunderstandings about God's identity and authority, in line with the concern provided. The concerns raised about semantic differences, cultural appropriation, preservation of cultural identity, and cultural sensitivity add depth to the argument. The only aspect that could be improved is providing more explicit connections to Christian theology or scripture to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
