**The Babylonian Captivity (586-539 BCE)**

Following King Solomon's death, Israel experienced a period of political and military decline. Around 586 BCE, the Babylonian Empire conquered Jerusalem and exiled the Jewish population to Babylonia. This event had a profound impact on Israel's history, leading to the Babylonian Captivity and the subsequent diaspora of the Jewish people.
