After King Solomon died, Israel was divided into two kingdoms: the northern kingdom called 'Israel' and the southern kingdom called 'Judah.'

Understanding the historical and spiritual significance of the division of the Israelites.

## [Answer](../Division_of_Israel.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The Babylonian Captivity (586-539 BCE)**

Following King Solomon's death, Israel experienced a period of political and military decline. Around 586 BCE, the Babylonian Empire conquered Jerusalem and exiled the Jewish population to Babylonia. This event had a profound impact on Israel's history, leading to the Babylonian Captivity and the subsequent diaspora of the Jewish people.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer correctly identifies a major event in Israel's history, the Babylonian Captivity, but does not address the specific concern of the division of the Israelites after King Solomon's reign. While the Babylonian Captivity is an important event, it is not directly related to the division of the Israelites into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The student should have focused on explaining the significance of this division in relation to Israel's history and spiritual journey.
