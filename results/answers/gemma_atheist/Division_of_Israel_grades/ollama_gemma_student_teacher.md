## Correct Answer
After King Solomon died, Israel was divided into two kingdoms: the northern kingdom called 'Israel' and the southern kingdom called 'Judah.'

Understanding the historical and spiritual significance of the division of the Israelites.

## [Answer](../Division_of_Israel.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The Babylonian Captivity (586-539 BCE)**

Following King Solomon's death, Israel experienced a period of political and military decline. Around 586 BCE, the Babylonian Empire conquered Jerusalem and exiled the Jewish population to Babylonia. This event had a profound impact on Israel's history, leading to the Babylonian Captivity and the subsequent diaspora of the Jewish people.

## Grade: 80

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the Babylonian Captivity as the major event that occurred in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign. They also briefly explain its impact on the Jewish population. However, the answer lacks elaboration on the spiritual significance of the division of the Israelites, which was the specified concern in the question.
