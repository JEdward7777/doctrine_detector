  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does mention the event that occurred after King Solomon's death, which is correct. However, it fails to provide any insight into the spiritual significance of this division or its impact on Israel's history and the people involved. The concern was to understand the historical and spiritual significance of the division, but this response only scratches the surface by mentioning the physical event itself.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response would need to delve deeper into the biblical context and explore how this event relates to God's plan for His people. For example, it could discuss how the division reflected Israel's disobedience to God or how it led to the eventual exile of the Jewish people, which is mentioned in the initial response.\n\nOverall, while the response is a good start, it does not adequately address the concern and therefore receives a score of 60."
