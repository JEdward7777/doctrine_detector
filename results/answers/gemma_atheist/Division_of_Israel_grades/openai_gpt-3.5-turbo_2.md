## [Answer](../Division_of_Israel.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The Babylonian Captivity (586-539 BCE)**

Following King Solomon's death, Israel experienced a period of political and military decline. Around 586 BCE, the Babylonian Empire conquered Jerusalem and exiled the Jewish population to Babylonia. This event had a profound impact on Israel's history, leading to the Babylonian Captivity and the subsequent diaspora of the Jewish people.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately explains the historical division of Israel into two kingdoms following King Solomon's death. However, it does not directly address the concern about understanding the historical and spiritual significance of this division from a Christian perspective. A stronger connection between the historical event and its spiritual implications within a Christian worldview would have enhanced the response and provided a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.
