After King Solomon died, Israel was divided into two kingdoms: the northern kingdom called 'Israel' and the southern kingdom called 'Judah.'

Understanding the historical and spiritual significance of the division of the Israelites.

## [Answer](../Division_of_Israel.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The Babylonian Captivity (586-539 BCE)**

Following King Solomon's death, Israel experienced a period of political and military decline. Around 586 BCE, the Babylonian Empire conquered Jerusalem and exiled the Jewish population to Babylonia. This event had a profound impact on Israel's history, leading to the Babylonian Captivity and the subsequent diaspora of the Jewish people.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the division of the Israelites into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah following King Solomon's death. It highlights an important historical and spiritual event in Israel's history. However, the response does not directly address the concern of the Babylonian Captivity and its significance, which is the focus of the question.
