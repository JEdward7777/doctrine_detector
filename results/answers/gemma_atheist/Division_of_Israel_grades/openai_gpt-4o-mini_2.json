However, to fully address the concern of understanding the division's spiritual significance, it would have been beneficial to include an explanation of how this division was a result of the Israelites turning away from God and disobeying His commands, as depicted in the Old Testament narratives. This additional spiritual insight would have enhanced the overall response."
