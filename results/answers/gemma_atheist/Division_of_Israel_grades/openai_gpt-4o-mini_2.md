## [Answer](../Division_of_Israel.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The Babylonian Captivity (586-539 BCE)**

Following King Solomon's death, Israel experienced a period of political and military decline. Around 586 BCE, the Babylonian Empire conquered Jerusalem and exiled the Jewish population to Babylonia. This event had a profound impact on Israel's history, leading to the Babylonian Captivity and the subsequent diaspora of the Jewish people.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the division of the Israelites into two kingdoms after King Solomon's death, highlighting the historical significance. However, to fully address the concern of understanding the division's spiritual significance, it would have been beneficial to include an explanation of how this division was a result of the Israelites turning away from God and disobeying His commands, as depicted in the Old Testament narratives. This additional spiritual insight would have enhanced the overall response.
