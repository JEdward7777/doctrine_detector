The inclusion of traditional and alternative interpretations along with relevant biblical texts is commendable. However, the student's analysis leans more towards a secular environmental perspective and lacks a strong emphasis on the biblical teachings of dominion as understood in Christian theology. It would be beneficial for the student to provide a more robust explanation of the biblical concept of dominion, linking it back to God's original intention for humanity as stewards of creation."
