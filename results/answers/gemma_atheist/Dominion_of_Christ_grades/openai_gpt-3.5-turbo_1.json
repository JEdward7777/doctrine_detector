However, it falls short of recognizing the full extent of Christ's dominion over all aspects of life and how this impacts our faith. While the response avoids providing interpretations on religious doctrines or figures, it could have emphasized more on the transformative power of Christ's authority in shaping believers' lives and worldview."
