The concern about recognizing Christ's authority in all aspects of life and its impact on faith is directly addressed in the response, demonstrating a strong understanding of the Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is due to the initial disclaimer about not providing interpretations related to religious doctrines, which may have seemed unnecessary given the subsequent affirmation of Christian beliefs."
