## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The biblical texts offer varying interpretations regarding the duration of "the last days." Interpretations of these texts can vary widely depending on theological and cultural contexts.

**Biblical Interpretations:**

* **Majority of interpreters:** Interpret the "last days" as a symbolic period encompassing the decline of human civilization and the eventual return of Jesus Christ. This interpretation emphasizes spiritual significance rather than a literal number of days.
* **Some scholars:** Suggest a literal interpretation of 40 days or 126 days, based on specific biblical passages. However, these interpretations lack widespread consensus and are often contested by other scholars.

**Cultural Influences:**

Cultural interpretations of the "last days" can also influence understanding. Some cultures associate the concept with specific historical events or prophecies. For example:

* **Premillennialism:** Popular in certain Christian traditions, this belief interprets the "last days" as a literal period preceding the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, which is believed to be imminent.
* **Apocalyptic literature:** Literature from various cultures often explores the concept of the "end times," which can influence interpretations of the "last days" in biblical texts.

**Conclusion:**

The duration of "the last days" is not explicitly specified in the Bible and remains an open-ended question. Interpretations and cultural influences can significantly impact understanding of this concept.
