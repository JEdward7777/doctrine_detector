However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on a doctrinally correct understanding based on a Christian worldview. It is important to highlight that from a Christian perspective, the concept of \"the last days\" primarily refers to the period leading up to the second coming of Jesus Christ and the final judgment. While the answer acknowledges this perspective in passing, there could be a stronger emphasis on the belief in the imminent return of Christ and the necessity for readiness and watchfulness during these times. Additionally, the mention of cultural influences could be connected more explicitly to how they either align with or diverge from Biblical teachings. Strengthening the doctrinal foundation and providing clearer connections between interpretations and biblical teachings would improve the answer."
