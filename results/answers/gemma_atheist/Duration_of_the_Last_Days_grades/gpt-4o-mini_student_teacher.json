However, while the answer does address the concern raised about how uncertainty can impact Christian faith, it falls short of directly connecting the discussion to how Christians should live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. A stronger emphasis on the practical implications for Christian living in the face of this uncertainty would have further enhanced the response."
