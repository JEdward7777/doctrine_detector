  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the biblical texts, acknowledging the varying interpretations and cultural influences that shape understanding of the \"last days.\" While it doesn't directly address the concern about uncertainty affecting Christian living, the discussion highlights the complexity of the concept, which is crucial in understanding its implications for faith practices. The response's strength lies in its nuanced exploration of different perspectives and the lack of a clear biblical timeline, demonstrating an excellent grasp of the topic.\n\nTo further improve, the response could explicitly connect the uncertainty about the duration of \"the last days\" to its potential impact on Christian living, as requested by the concern. This would strengthen the response's ability to engage with the concern and provide a more comprehensive discussion."
