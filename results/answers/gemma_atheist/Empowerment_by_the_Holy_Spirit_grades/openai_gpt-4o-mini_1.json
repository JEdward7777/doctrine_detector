From a Christian worldview perspective, understanding and relying on the Holy Spirit's empowerment is essential for believers to fulfill their calling and effectively live out their faith. The response fails to acknowledge the significance of spiritual beliefs and practices in the lives of Christians, which is a key component of their worldview."
