  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough analysis of the cultural influences on religious beliefs as seen in Gideon's creation of the golden ephod. They effectively address how symbols can become idols, the potential for idolatry to arise from sincere beliefs, and the importance of understanding cultural context in religious interpretation. However, the answer could have more directly emphasized the significance of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. A stronger connection to the specified concern would have resulted in a higher grade."
