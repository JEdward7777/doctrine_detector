  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of exploring the lesson from Gideon's golden ephod, highlighting the dangers of cultural influences on religious beliefs and the importance of keeping objects associated with worship in proper perspective. The five points presented are well-articulated and thoughtful, demonstrating a strong understanding of the biblical account and its implications.\n\nThe response also effectively connects the story to the concern about focusing on God rather than being distracted by material representations of faith. The final section on \"Implications for answering culturally-retributed questions\" is particularly helpful in providing practical advice for scholars and laypeople alike.\n\nWhere the response falls short is in not fully developing some of the points, particularly point 2 (\"Symbols can become idols\"). While the idea is presented, it could be fleshed out further to provide more nuance and depth. Additionally, a few of the sentences could be tightened up for greater clarity and concision.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent response that effectively engages with the lesson from Gideon's golden ephod and its implications for our understanding of God and faith. With some further development and refinement, it has the potential to be even more impactful."
