  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively captures the essence of the lesson learned from Gideon's Golden Ephod, emphasizing the danger of material objects becoming idols and diverting attention from true worship of God. It aligns well with the concern of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith. The analysis provided is insightful and demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview regarding idolatry and the importance of maintaining proper perspective in worship. The only room for improvement could be to further elaborate on how this lesson applies to contemporary Christian practice and potential pitfalls in today's cultural context."
