The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the complexity surrounding this topic. However, from a Christian worldview, it would have been beneficial for the student to emphasize the symbolic and spiritual significance of the ephod within the context of religious practices, as its role in facilitating communication with God was central to its purpose. Additionally, there could have been more explicit references to Scripture or Jewish tradition to support the interpretations presented."
