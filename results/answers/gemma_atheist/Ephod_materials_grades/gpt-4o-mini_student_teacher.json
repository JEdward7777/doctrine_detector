  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer, considering various perspectives including biblical interpretations, scholarly views, archaeological findings, and cultural considerations. However, the specific answer given by the teacher regarding the materials used in the high priest's ephod was not explicitly mentioned by the student. The student effectively addressed the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding the materials in relation to the ephod's design and symbolism in worship."
