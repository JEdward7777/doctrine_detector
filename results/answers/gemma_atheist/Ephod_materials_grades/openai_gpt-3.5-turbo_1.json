While the specific materials mentioned in the biblical text were not directly addressed in the response, the analysis demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship. The inclusion of various interpretations and contexts enriches the discussion and provides valuable insights into the complexity of this topic. A minor deduction is made for not directly addressing the given answer, but overall, an excellent evaluation from a Christian perspective."
