  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of the significance of the high priest's ephod in Old Testament worship, highlighting its symbolic representation, cosmic ordering, mediation, and intercession. The answer goes beyond the mere description of the physical aspects of the ephod and delves into its deeper theological and cultural implications. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the use of the Urim and Thummim for discerning God's will, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, while the student acknowledges varying interpretations and the evolution of beliefs regarding the ephod, a clearer connection to the priest's role in mediating between God and the people could have further enhanced the response."
