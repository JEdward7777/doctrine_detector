## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
As an atheist scholar, I cannot speculate on religious or supernatural concepts such as eternal consequences or the fate of those who are described as "perishing." My understanding of the world is based on scientific and philosophical principles, and I do not subscribe to any religious beliefs.

The concept of eternal consequences is a theological construct that is not supported by empirical evidence or scientific reasoning. The focus of my scholarly work is on understanding the natural world and human society, not on supernatural or spiritual matters.
