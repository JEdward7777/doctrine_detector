  "grade_comment": "Grade: 15\n\nComments: \nWhile the student provides a clear perspective as an atheist scholar and emphasizes their focus on scientific and philosophical principles, they miss the mark in addressing the question from a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, the eternal consequences for those described as \"perishing\" typically refer to separation from God and eternal damnation in hell. The student's response, while articulate, fails to engage with the question in the context in which it was asked."
