  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not engage with the specific concern presented in the question, which is understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God. Instead, the student dismisses the concept of eternal consequences and focuses on their atheistic perspective. In a Christian worldview, it is important to acknowledge and address the theological implications of eternal separation from God, even if one does not personally believe in those concepts. The student could have respectfully discussed the Christian perspective on this issue without endorsing it personally."
