## Question [Eternal Consequences](../../../questions/Eternal_Consequences.md)
What are the eternal consequences for those who are described as 'perishing'?

## Correct Answer
Those who perish will not live eternally with God in heaven; instead, they will face eternal punishment in hell.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God.

## [Answer](../Eternal_Consequences.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
As an atheist scholar, I cannot speculate on religious or supernatural concepts such as eternal consequences or the fate of those who are described as "perishing." My understanding of the world is based on scientific and philosophical principles, and I do not subscribe to any religious beliefs.

The concept of eternal consequences is a theological construct that is not supported by empirical evidence or scientific reasoning. The focus of my scholarly work is on understanding the natural world and human society, not on supernatural or spiritual matters.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
20.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 20.

While the respondent correctly acknowledges that their perspective as an atheist scholar means they cannot speculate on religious or supernatural concepts, their overall tone and language dismissive of eternal consequences, which undermines the concern about understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God. The respondent's rejection of eternal punishment in hell as a "theological construct" not supported by empirical evidence may be seen as insensitive to those who hold this belief as a cornerstone of their faith.

To receive a higher score, the response should engage with the concern about eternal separation from God in a more nuanced and respectful manner, acknowledging the gravity of the issue even if they do not personally subscribe to it.
