## Question [Eternal Consequences](../../../questions/Eternal_Consequences.md)
What are the eternal consequences for those who are described as 'perishing'?

## Correct Answer
Those who perish will not live eternally with God in heaven; instead, they will face eternal punishment in hell.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God.

## [Answer](../Eternal_Consequences.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
As an atheist scholar, I cannot speculate on religious or supernatural concepts such as eternal consequences or the fate of those who are described as "perishing." My understanding of the world is based on scientific and philosophical principles, and I do not subscribe to any religious beliefs.

The concept of eternal consequences is a theological construct that is not supported by empirical evidence or scientific reasoning. The focus of my scholarly work is on understanding the natural world and human society, not on supernatural or spiritual matters.

20.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response from the atheist scholar completely rejects the Christian worldview of eternal consequences and separation from God. From a Christian perspective, understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God is foundational to the belief in salvation through Jesus Christ. This response dismisses this concern and fails to engage with the Christian perspective offered.
