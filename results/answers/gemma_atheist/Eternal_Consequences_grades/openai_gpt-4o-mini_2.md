## Question [Eternal Consequences](../../../questions/Eternal_Consequences.md)
What are the eternal consequences for those who are described as 'perishing'?

## Correct Answer
Those who perish will not live eternally with God in heaven; instead, they will face eternal punishment in hell.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God.

## [Answer](../Eternal_Consequences.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
As an atheist scholar, I cannot speculate on religious or supernatural concepts such as eternal consequences or the fate of those who are described as "perishing." My understanding of the world is based on scientific and philosophical principles, and I do not subscribe to any religious beliefs.

The concept of eternal consequences is a theological construct that is not supported by empirical evidence or scientific reasoning. The focus of my scholarly work is on understanding the natural world and human society, not on supernatural or spiritual matters.

## Grade by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
10.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 10

Comment: The response from the atheist scholar does not address the concern of understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God at all. The worldview presented is purely secular and does not engage with the Christian perspective on the consequences of not being in relationship with God.
