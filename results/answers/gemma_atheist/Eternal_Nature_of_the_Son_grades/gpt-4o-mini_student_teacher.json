  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-organized answer that addresses the distinction between the 'Son of God' and human sons from various perspectives. They have elaborated on key points such as ontological status, eternal nature, divine attributes, sacrificial atonement, unique relationship with God, cultural significance, and transcendence of human limitations. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher emphasizes the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God, which the student's response does not directly address. Despite this, the student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and provides valuable insights from a Christian worldview."
