  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer strays significantly from a Christian worldview by dismissing the concept of eternal punishment in hell as anthropocentric and culturally influenced. The student's arguments against the idea of hell and eternal punishment do not align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which is based on Christian beliefs. The answer lacks a coherent Biblical perspective and does not address the concern about divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. Consequently, the grade is low as the response does not reflect an understanding of the Christian specific worldview."
