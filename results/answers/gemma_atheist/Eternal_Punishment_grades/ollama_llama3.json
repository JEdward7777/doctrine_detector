  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does address the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences, and it provides some biblical justification for the concept of hell. However, the response could be stronger in several ways:\n\n* The response primarily focuses on the idea that those who do not believe in Jesus' sacrifice will go to hell, without addressing the broader concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy.\n* While the response mentions God's justice in responding to rebellion and rejection of His salvation plan, it does not adequately consider alternative views or philosophical concerns about eternal punishment.\n* The response could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of the biblical passages that support the idea of hell, rather than simply presenting them as fact.\n\nOverall, while this response provides some relevant information and biblical justification for the concept of hell, it could be stronger in its analysis and consideration of alternative perspectives."
