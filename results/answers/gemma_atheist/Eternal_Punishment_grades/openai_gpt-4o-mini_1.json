However, the Christian specific concern regarding the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences is not adequately addressed. The response fails to engage directly with the Christian worldview of sin, redemption, and the ultimate justice of God as revealed in Scripture. A more balanced approach that considers both perspectives would enhance the overall evaluation."
