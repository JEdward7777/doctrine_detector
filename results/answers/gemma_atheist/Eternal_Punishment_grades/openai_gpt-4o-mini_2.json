However, from a Christian worldview, the answer lacks a robust defense of the biblical understanding of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. It is important to engage more deeply with Biblical theology and address how God's justice and mercy are understood in light of the concept of eternal punishment. Consider incorporating scriptural references and theological arguments to strengthen the response from a Christian perspective."
