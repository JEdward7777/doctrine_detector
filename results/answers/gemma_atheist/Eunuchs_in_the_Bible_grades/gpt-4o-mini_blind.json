  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid analysis of the interpretation of Matthew 19:12 and its connection to celibacy. The student effectively explores possible meanings of \"eunuchs\" in both a literal and symbolic sense, ultimately coming to a reasoned conclusion. The inclusion of cultural considerations adds depth to the discussion. To improve, the student could further elaborate on the theological significance of celibacy within Christian teachings and its historical development within the Church."
