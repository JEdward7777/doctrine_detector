  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured answer with a good analysis of the possible interpretations of \"eunuchs\" in Matthew 19:12 and their connection to the concept of celibacy. They effectively explained the symbolic interpretation of eunuchs as those who have renounced sexual activity for religious reasons. However, the student could have delved deeper into the direct connection between Jesus' statement and celibacy as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic but could have strengthened their argument by directly addressing the three categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus in the verse."
