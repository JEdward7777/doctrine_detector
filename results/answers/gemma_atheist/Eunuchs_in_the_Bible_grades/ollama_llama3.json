  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear interpretation of Matthew 19:12, explaining that Jesus' reference to \"eunuchs\" is likely symbolic, referring to individuals who have renounced sexual activity for religious reasons. The discussion of cultural considerations and the importance of understanding the original context of the text are also well-handled.\n\nHowever, while the response does touch on celibacy as a path to spiritual growth and deeper connection with God, it could be more explicitly connected to the concern about understanding the different reasons for living a life without marriage. Additionally, some of the supporting arguments (e.g., \"it contradicts Jesus' teachings about forgiveness and compassion\") feel slightly tangential to the main point.\n\nOverall, the response is well-organized and provides a thoughtful interpretation of Matthew 19:12. With some further development of the connection to the concern and more direct support for the main points, it could be even stronger.\n\nComment: Well-reasoned and informative, this response effectively interprets Jesus' teaching on \"eunuchs\" in Matthew 19:12. While it could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern about celibacy, it remains a strong effort."
