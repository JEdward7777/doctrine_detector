  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not align with a Christian worldview and fundamental understanding of exalting God. The answer lacks a recognition of God as a personal being deserving of worship, praise, and obedience. It focuses too much on cultural relativism and fails to address the importance of exalting God above all else in life from a Christian perspective. It is important for the student to understand and respect differing beliefs while also properly addressing the specific concerns raised in the question."
