  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the cultural significance of exalting God but falls short in addressing the importance of exalting God above all else in life, as highlighted in the concern. While it provides a respectful perspective on understanding diverse beliefs, it does not fully engage with the Christian worldview of prioritizing God in all aspects of life. Further elaboration on the unique importance of exalting God in a Christian context would have strengthened the response."
