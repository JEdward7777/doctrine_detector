  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response overall provides a thoughtful and respectful perspective on exalting God in a cultural context, acknowledging the significance of spiritual beliefs even from a non-theistic standpoint. The answer given aligns with the Christian worldview of exalting God through worship, prayer, and obedience to His will. However, the response falls short in fully addressing the concern of understanding the importance of exalting God above all else in life. While the response acknowledges the cultural significance of exalting God, it lacks a clear emphasis on the supremacy of God in a person's life, which is a key aspect of the Christian faith."
