  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the Parable of the Prodigal Son, highlighting its significance in terms of redemption, compassion, humility, and acceptance. The critique offered valuable insights into potential cultural biases embedded in the parable. The answer demonstrated a good understanding of the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. However, the student could have further connected the parable to a Christian-specific worldview and theology, providing deeper analysis from that perspective."
