  "grade_comment": "Grade: 88\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of the Parable of the Prodigal Son, highlighting its themes of redemption, compassion, humility, and acceptance. The critique offered regarding potential reinforcement of cultural biases is thought-provoking and adds depth to the discussion. While the response effectively examines the significance of this parable, some additional exploration of how the parable can be practically applied today could further enhance the analysis."
