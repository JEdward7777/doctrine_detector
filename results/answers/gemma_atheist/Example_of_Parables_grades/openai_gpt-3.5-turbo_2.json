  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively analyzes the Parable of the Prodigal Son, highlighting its themes of redemption, compassion, humility, and acceptance. The critique provided adds depth to the analysis by considering potential cultural biases within the parable. The conclusion is thoughtful and acknowledges the complexity of the story. While the response does not directly address the story of the Good Samaritan, it successfully reflects on the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables and their relevance today."
