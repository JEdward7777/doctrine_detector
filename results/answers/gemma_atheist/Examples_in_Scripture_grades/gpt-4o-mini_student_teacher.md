Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer lacks alignment with a Christian worldview as it disregards the spiritual realities presented in the Bible. Demon possession is a significant aspect of the Biblical narrative, and understanding its prevalence is crucial in grasping the spiritual warfare highlighted in the Scriptures. It is important for students to engage with the subject matter from a Christian perspective, even if personal beliefs differ.
