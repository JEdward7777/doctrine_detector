  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the examples given and their significance in illustrating the concepts of guilt, justice, and innocence. However, the concern raised about the need for divine judgment is not directly addressed in the response, which limits the depth of analysis from a Christian worldview perspective. More explicit integration of this concern would have strengthened the response further."
