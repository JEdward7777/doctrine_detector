## Question [Examples of Guilt in Scripture](../../../questions/Examples_of_Guilt_in_Scripture.md)
What are some examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Pilate declaring Jesus innocent despite the accusations and the robber acknowledging their own guilt compared to Jesus in Luke 23:41.

## Stated Concern
These examples help us understand how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the examples given and their significance in illustrating the concepts of guilt, justice, and innocence. However, the concern raised about the need for divine judgment is not directly addressed in the response, which limits the depth of analysis from a Christian worldview perspective. More explicit integration of this concern would have strengthened the response further.
