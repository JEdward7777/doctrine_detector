## Question [Examples of Guilt in Scripture](../../../questions/Examples_of_Guilt_in_Scripture.md)
What are some examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Pilate declaring Jesus innocent despite the accusations and the robber acknowledging their own guilt compared to Jesus in Luke 23:41.

These examples help us understand how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response acknowledges and references specific examples from a Christian religious text, which demonstrates an understanding of the Christian worldview. However, the response still falls short of addressing the concern provided, which highlights the need for divine judgment. Encouraging further reflection on the implications of the examples in relation to divine judgment would enhance the response.
