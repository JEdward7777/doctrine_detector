  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment:\nWhile the student accurately lists specific miracles of Jesus and their potential cultural and historical interpretations, their overall approach lacks the recognition of the supernatural and divine nature of these miracles. The student's emphasis on cultural and historical explanations undermines the core significance of these miracles in affirming Jesus as the Son of God. A Christian perspective would require acknowledging the miraculous and supernatural elements as central to understanding Jesus' identity and the belief in His divine nature."
