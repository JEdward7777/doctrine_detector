  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced analysis of the significance of Jesus' miracles from a Christian perspective. They acknowledge the cultural and historical contexts in which these miracles occurred while offering interpretations that align with their atheist beliefs. The student's ability to provide detailed explanations for each miracle and their consideration of different interpretations demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter. However, the grade could be improved by explicitly acknowledging the biblical accounts of the miracles and engaging more directly with the provided reference answer."
