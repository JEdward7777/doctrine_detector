  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided falls short in acknowledging the true Christian significance of Jesus' miracles as signs of His divinity and the establishment of God's kingdom. It dismisses supernatural explanations in favor of purely cultural and historical interpretations, which undermines the central Christian belief in the miraculous nature of these events. It ultimately detracts from the understanding of Jesus as the Son of God."
