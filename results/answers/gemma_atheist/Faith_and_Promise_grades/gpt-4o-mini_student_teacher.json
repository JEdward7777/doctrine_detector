  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely disregards the Christian worldview and fails to address the concern posed. They dismiss the significance of faith in God's promises and misinterpret the example of Abram by attempting to explain it through secular and cultural lenses. The response lacks biblical foundation and understanding of the role of faith in a Christian context."
