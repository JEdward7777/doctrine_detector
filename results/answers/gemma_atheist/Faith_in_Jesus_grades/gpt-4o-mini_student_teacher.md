Grade: 20

Comment: The student did not address the concern of understanding the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life. They missed the opportunity to apply a Christian worldview to the concept of believing in Jesus as described in the text. It is crucial for them to make that connection in order to fully engage with the question from a Christian perspective.
