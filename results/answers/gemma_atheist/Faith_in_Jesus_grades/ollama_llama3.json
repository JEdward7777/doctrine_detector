  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe response correctly identifies that it cannot provide an interpretation without the provided text, which shows an awareness of the limitations of the prompt. However, it does not engage with the concern about understanding the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life, nor does it provide any insight into how believing in Jesus relates to a Christian's daily life.\n\nTo earn a higher grade, the response could have explored how trusting in Jesus affects one's decisions, relationships, or values. While acknowledging the importance of having the provided text is important, simply stating that limitation without moving towards applying faith in Jesus' name does not demonstrate understanding of the concern."
