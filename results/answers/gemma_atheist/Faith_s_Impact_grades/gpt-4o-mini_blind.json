  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided completely negates the aspect of true faith in Jesus as a spiritual and foundational belief in Christianity. It fails to acknowledge the essential element of personal relationship with Jesus Christ which involves repentance, surrender, and discipleship. From a Christian worldview, true faith in Jesus goes beyond ethical behavior, personal transformation, and cultural influences; it involves salvation, sanctification, and obedience to God's Word. This answer lacks doctrinal correctness and minimizes the centrality of Jesus in the life of a believer."
