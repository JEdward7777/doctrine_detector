However, the answer strays away from the Christian worldview by not emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in producing good spiritual fruits or behaviors. The focus on cultural and historical contexts and the absence of evidence to support traditional religious beliefs do not align with the given Christian-specific reference answer."
