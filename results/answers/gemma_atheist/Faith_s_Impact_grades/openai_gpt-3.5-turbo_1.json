However, the response lacks acknowledgment of the Christian worldview's belief in the role of the Holy Spirit in producing good spiritual fruits through genuine faith. From a Christian perspective, authentic faith in Jesus is indeed expected to result in positive behaviors and spiritual transformation due to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, while the atheistic perspective presented is comprehensive, it falls short in addressing the Christian-specific concern of recognizing genuine faith in daily life."
