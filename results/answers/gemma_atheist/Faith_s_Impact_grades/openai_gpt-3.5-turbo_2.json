However, the response did not directly address the idea that true faith in Jesus, as indicated by the presence of the Holy Spirit, produces good spiritual fruits or behaviors. From a Christian worldview, the Holy Spirit's transformative work in an individual's life would be considered essential in identifying genuine faith. Therefore, the response could have better integrated the Christian perspective on the role of the Holy Spirit in producing good spiritual fruits in evaluating faith."
