  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough and well-written response on faithfulness in marriage, there is a lack of specificity in directly addressing the concern of how Christians are called to maintain integrity and faithfulness in their marriages with a Christian worldview. The response could have been strengthened by directly referencing biblical passages and teachings that emphasize the importance of faithfulness within marriage, such as the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student did a good job exploring various aspects of the topic and incorporating cultural considerations, but a more direct connection to Christian teachings and values would have enhanced the response."
