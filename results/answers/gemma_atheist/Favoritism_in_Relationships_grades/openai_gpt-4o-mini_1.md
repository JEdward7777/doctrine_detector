* **Context-dependent:** The appropriateness of favoritism can depend on the specific context and relationship. 
* **Transparency and accountability:** When favoritism is practiced consciously and transparently, its negative effects can be mitigated.


**Addressing questions in a culturally-retuned way:**

* **Avoid making generalizations:** Recognize that individuals within any group are diverse and should be treated as such.
* **Challenge assumptions:** Question the underlying biases that may influence your responses.
* **Promote inclusivity:** Encourage and celebrate diverse perspectives and experiences.
