  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of finding grace in the eyes of God from a Christian perspective. They provide a nuanced analysis of the cultural, psychological, and philosophical implications of the concept. The student's critique of the supernaturalism and cultural bias associated with the concept is insightful. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit explanation of how the concept of grace aligns with Christian theology."
