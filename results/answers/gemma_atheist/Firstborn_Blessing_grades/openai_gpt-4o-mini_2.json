  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response misses the mark by avoiding the religious context and focusing solely on historical and cultural analysis. While the response is coherent and well-written, it fails to engage with the Christian-specific worldview and spiritual significance of the concept of birthright. In a Christian worldview, the concept of birthright carries deep spiritual implications related to faith and stewardship within the family."
