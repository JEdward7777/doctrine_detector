The connection made to God's authority in the plan is appropriate. However, the response could have gone into more depth in elaborating on how these concepts interact within Christian theology. The concerns raised from an atheological perspective are valid but could be more fully developed. Overall, a solid explanation but with room for more expansion and depth."
