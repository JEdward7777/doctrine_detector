The answer aligns well with the concern of encouraging believers to address sin for a deeper relationship with God, emphasizing the importance of shifting focus from fear to faith and embracing God's grace. The student could further strengthen their answer by directly tying the solutions to the reference answer provided by the teacher, showing a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview of repentance and faith in Jesus for true restoration and freedom."
