  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: This response, while well-articulated and thoughtful, deviates significantly from the Christian worldview. The fruits of the Holy Spirit are deeply rooted in the Christian faith and are believed to be gifts bestowed by the Holy Spirit to believers. The student's perspective, while valuable in its own right, does not align with traditional Christian teachings on the topic. A higher grade could have been achieved by incorporating the Christian understanding of the fruits of the Holy Spirit and how they manifest in a wise person's life."
