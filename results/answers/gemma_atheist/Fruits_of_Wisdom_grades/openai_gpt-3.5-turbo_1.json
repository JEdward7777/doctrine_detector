The response attempts to provide a humanistic and atheistic perspective on spiritual growth, which deviates from the essential Christian understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in transforming individuals into Christ-like beings. It is crucial to integrate the foundational beliefs of Christianity, such as the role of the Holy Spirit in spiritual growth, when discussing these virtues."
