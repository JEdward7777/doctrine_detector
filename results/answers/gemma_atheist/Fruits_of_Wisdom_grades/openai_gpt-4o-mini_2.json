The emphasis on humanism and personal development, while commendable, does not fully address the core concern of manifesting the fruits of the Holy Spirit as essential for spiritual growth and reflecting Christ-like character. Incorporating explicit references to the role of the Holy Spirit and aligning the virtues discussed with biblical teachings would enhance the response from a Christian perspective."
