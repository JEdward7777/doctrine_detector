  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of different aspects related to the fulfillment of prophecy according to Biblical teaching. The inclusion of literal, symbolic, theological, and contextual fulfillments, along with relevant Biblical teachings, demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. The student's acknowledgment of challenges in defining fulfillment and considerations for cultural retribution adds depth to the response. However, to improve, the student could further elaborate on specific examples of prophecies fulfilled in the Bible to strengthen the explanation."
