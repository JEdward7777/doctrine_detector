  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided an extensive and detailed explanation on different aspects of prophecy fulfillment according to Biblical teaching, encompassing literal, symbolic, theological, and contextual perspectives. They also highlighted key Biblical teachings related to fulfillment and raised awareness about challenges in defining fulfillment and cultural considerations. However, the student's answer lacked a direct connection to how God interacts with prophecy fulfillment as per the given teacher's reference answer. The key aspect of God causing the fulfillment of prophecies is not explicitly addressed or emphasized in their response. This connection is essential in a Christian worldview when understanding prophecy."
