However, it falls short in addressing the concern fully, as it does not delve deeply into how prophecies strengthen faith and reveal God's plan. While it is important to consider caution in interpreting prophecies, the response could have provided a more balanced perspective by emphasizing the divine aspect of fulfilled prophecies in strengthening faith."
