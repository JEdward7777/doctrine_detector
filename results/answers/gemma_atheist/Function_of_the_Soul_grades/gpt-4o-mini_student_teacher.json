However, the student's answer could be improved by directly addressing the concern raised by acknowledging how these figurative uses provide deeper insight into human experience from a biblical perspective, as specified in the concern statement. Additionally, the conclusion could have better tied back to the importance of understanding human identity in the biblical context. Nonetheless, the student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the figurative language surrounding 'soul.'"
