  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The student provides a well-thought-out exploration of the concept of 'holy place' beyond the traditional tabernacle or temple. They effectively discuss various aspects such as cultural, psychological, emotional, and social significance, as well as the idea of spiritual but non-religious connections. However, to align more closely with a Christian worldview, the response could have included specific references to the Bible and the Christian understanding of holy places, such as the presence of God, the significance of certain locations in Christian history, and the role of believers as temples of the Holy Spirit. Overall, a good exploration but could benefit from more direct integration of Christian theological perspectives."
