Grade: 60

Comment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive exploration of various perspectives on 'holy places' beyond traditional religious structures, considering cultural, psychological, and social dimensions. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of identifying places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter. While the answer offers insightful reflections on the broad understanding of 'holy places', it lacks a clear connection to the Christian worldview emphasizing the sanctity of places set apart for God in worship. The student could strengthen their response by incorporating the Christian perspective on sacred spaces and the importance of divine encounter in relation to 'holy places'.
