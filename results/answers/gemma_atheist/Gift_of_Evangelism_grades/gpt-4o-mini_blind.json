The points are clear and well-differentiated. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to emphasize the centrality of the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) in the role of an evangelist, as well as the importance of the Holy Spirit's guidance in evangelism. Additionally, incorporating scriptural references to support each distinction would have further strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
