  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThis response touches on some key aspects related to evangelism, such as Christians being given special spiritual gifts for sharing the gospel. However, it falls short in providing more depth and nuance in its explanation. The distinctions made between evangelists and other Christians are somewhat superficial and don't fully capture the complexity of these roles.\n\nThe concern is about understanding spiritual gifts related to evangelism, but this response only scratches the surface on that topic. It would be helpful to explore specific examples of spiritual gifts and how they relate to evangelistic efforts in the church. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more thorough examination of the biblical basis for these distinctions.\n\nOverall, while this response shows some promise, it needs further development to truly address the concern and provide meaningful insights into the role of evangelism in the church."
