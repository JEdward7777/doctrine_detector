  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate distinction between the role of evangelists and other Christians based on spiritual gifts related to evangelism. It acknowledges the special gifting that some Christians receive for effectively sharing the gospel. The response effectively addresses the concern raised about understanding spiritual gifts related to evangelism within the church. The analysis is thorough and well-supported with relevant points and examples. However, there could be further expansion on how the spiritual gift of evangelism fits within the larger framework of spiritual gifts within the body of Christ and how it contributes to the overall mission of the church."
