  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of practical ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily lives, emphasizing actions, gratitude, relationships, mindfulness, reflection, creativity, and additional considerations. While the student's answer covers a wide range of behaviors and attitudes that can honor God's greatness, the reference answer from the teacher focusing on sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments provides a more focused and direct approach to emphasizing the importance of glorifying God. Therefore, the student's answer, while thorough, could benefit from more alignment with the central theme of reflecting God's glory to others through testimony and character."
