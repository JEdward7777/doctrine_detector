The suggested ways align well with the concern of emphasizing the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness, as they involve reflecting God's character and commandments, sharing testimonies of His goodness, and actively engaging in practices that demonstrate reverence and respect towards Him. The only improvement could be further emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commandments in daily living."
