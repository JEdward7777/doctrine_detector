The explanation on the need for divine intervention and the implications for ethics and behavior were clear and aligned with a Christian worldview. However, the response could have been more focused on directly addressing the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in actions and beliefs, as the teacher's reference answer specifically emphasized the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness."
