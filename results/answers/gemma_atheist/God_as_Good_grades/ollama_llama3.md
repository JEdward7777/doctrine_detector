What does Jesus mean when he states, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God'?

## Correct Answer

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.

## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**Jesus' statement, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God,' can be understood as follows:**

**1. Humanity's Inability to Be Good:**

* Jesus acknowledges the widespread human propensity towards moral failings and wrongdoing.
* He asserts that no human being is inherently or consistently "good" in the absolute sense.

**2. God's Perfect Goodness:**

* Conversely, God is characterized as the ultimate source of goodness.
* His goodness is perfect, complete, and unwavering.

**3. The Need for Divine Intervention:**

* Jesus highlights the inadequacy of human efforts to achieve true goodness.
* He suggests that salvation and moral transformation can only come from God.

**4. Moral Relativity and Cultural Context:**

* The concept of "goodness" is culturally relative and subject to interpretation.
* Jesus' statement transcends cultural boundaries and emphasizes the universality of God's inherent goodness.

**5. Implications for Ethics and Behavior:**

* If God is the ultimate source of goodness, it follows that we should align our actions with his moral principles.
* This realization encourages ethical behavior and a commitment to values that align with God's character.

**This statement should be interpreted within the context of Jesus' teachings, which emphasize love, compassion, and forgiveness. It suggests that God's goodness is not based on traditional religious laws or external behaviors, but on an intrinsic quality that transcends human limitations.**

Grade: 90

The response accurately captures the essence of Jesus' statement, emphasizing God's moral perfection and righteousness as the ultimate standard of goodness. The discussion of humanity's inability to be good and the need for divine intervention are also well-addressed.

However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly linking the concept of God's goodness to Christian ethics and behavior. While the response mentions the implications for ethics and behavior, it could delve deeper into how recognizing God as the source of goodness informs our actions and beliefs.

The concern about recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs is well-addressed, as the response highlights God's intrinsic quality that transcends human limitations. The discussion of moral relativity and cultural context also provides a nuanced understanding of Jesus' statement.

Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical concept and its implications for Christian living.
