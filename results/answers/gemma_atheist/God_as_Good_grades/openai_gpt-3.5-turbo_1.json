  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively articulates the Christian worldview that God is the ultimate source of goodness and righteousness. It makes a strong connection between recognizing God as the standard of goodness and aligning our actions and beliefs with His principles. The explanation provided is thorough, clear, and consistent with a Christian perspective. The only potential area for improvement could be a deeper exploration of how this understanding of God's goodness impacts specific ethical decisions and moral dilemmas in everyday life."
