## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**Jesus' statement, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God,' can be understood as follows:**

**1. Humanity's Inability to Be Good:**

* Jesus acknowledges the widespread human propensity towards moral failings and wrongdoing.
* He asserts that no human being is inherently or consistently "good" in the absolute sense.

**2. God's Perfect Goodness:**

* Conversely, God is characterized as the ultimate source of goodness.
* His goodness is perfect, complete, and unwavering.

**3. The Need for Divine Intervention:**

* Jesus highlights the inadequacy of human efforts to achieve true goodness.
* He suggests that salvation and moral transformation can only come from God.

**4. Moral Relativity and Cultural Context:**

* The concept of "goodness" is culturally relative and subject to interpretation.
* Jesus' statement transcends cultural boundaries and emphasizes the universality of God's inherent goodness.

**5. Implications for Ethics and Behavior:**

* If God is the ultimate source of goodness, it follows that we should align our actions with his moral principles.
* This realization encourages ethical behavior and a commitment to values that align with God's character.

**This statement should be interpreted within the context of Jesus' teachings, which emphasize love, compassion, and forgiveness. It suggests that God's goodness is not based on traditional religious laws or external behaviors, but on an intrinsic quality that transcends human limitations.**
