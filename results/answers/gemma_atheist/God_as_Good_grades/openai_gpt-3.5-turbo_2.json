It effectively connects the concept of God's perfect goodness as the ultimate standard for human morality and emphasizes the need for divine intervention in achieving true goodness. The discussion on moral relativity and cultural context adds depth to the interpretation. The response also appropriately addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. Overall, this is a well-thought-out and comprehensive explanation from a Christian worldview."
