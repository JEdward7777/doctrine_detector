It takes a purely atheistic viewpoint, failing to engage with or understand the theological significance of the term within Christianity. The answer dismisses fundamental Christian beliefs about God's sovereignty and grace, and instead, focuses solely on sociological interpretations from a secular standpoint. A deeper analysis rooted in Christian theology and scripture is needed to adequately address the question."
