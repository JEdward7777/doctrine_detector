  "grade": 25.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 25.\n\nWhile the student attempted to provide an analysis from an atheistic perspective, the response misses the mark in addressing the concern of recognizing the significance of being chosen by God. The answer focuses more on a secular interpretation of the concept of a remnant rather than engaging with the idea of God's selective grace. Additionally, the response does not effectively address the concept of God's favor and the theological implications of being chosen by God.\n\nThe student could have provided a more thorough comparison between the Christian worldview of God's selective grace towards His people and the atheistic viewpoint, examining the implications of being chosen by God within both perspectives. This would have shown a deeper engagement with the question and the concern provided."
