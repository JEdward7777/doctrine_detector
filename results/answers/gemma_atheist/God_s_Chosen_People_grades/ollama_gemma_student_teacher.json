  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-reasoned and thoughtful response that clearly articulates the conflict between the idea of a \"remnant\" and traditional theological concepts of selective grace. The student demonstrates a thorough understanding of the issue and provides a nuanced explanation from an atheistic perspective. While the response does not fully align with the teacher's reference answer, it offers a valid and insightful interpretation of the concept of a \"remnant\" that is consistent with the student's worldview."
