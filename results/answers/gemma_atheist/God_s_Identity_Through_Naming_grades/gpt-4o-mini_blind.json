  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student fails to engage with the Christian worldview in this response. Instead, they offer a purely atheistic perspective that dismisses the concept of being \"called by my name\" as merely a culturally conditioned phenomenon. The student overlooks the foundational belief in Christianity that God does call His people by name, as seen throughout the Bible (Isaiah 43:1, John 10:3). Additionally, the response neglects to consider the theological implications of this concept in terms of God's personal relationship with His people. Improvements are needed to align the answer with a Christian-specific worldview."
