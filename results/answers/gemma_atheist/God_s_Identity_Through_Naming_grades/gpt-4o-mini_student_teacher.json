  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely misses the Christian perspective on the concept of being 'called by my name' in relation to our relationship with God. The answer from an atheistic perspective and the exploration of cultural influences, possible interpretations, and alternative perspectives are irrelevant to the concern of exploring the implications of identity and belonging to God in a Christian's life. The student failed to engage with the Christian worldview and provide a meaningful analysis within that context."
