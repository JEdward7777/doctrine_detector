  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The student has provided a well-structured and thoughtful response to the question. They have touched upon various important points, such as cultural influences, intentional communication, human agency, purpose and direction, and ethical implications. The explanation provided is clear and concise. However, the student could strengthen their answer by incorporating more scriptural references or theological teachings to support their points. This would further enhance the doctrinal correctness and depth of their response from a Christian perspective."
