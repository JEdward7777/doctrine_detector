  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The response from an atheistic perspective fails to engage with the biblical understanding of God's jealousy. It dismisses the concept as a cultural and literary construct without acknowledging the theological significance behind it. From a Christian worldview, God's jealousy is rooted in His righteous and exclusive love for His people, as described in the Bible. The interpretation provided lacks doctrinal correctness and overlooks the fundamental truths of the Christian faith."
