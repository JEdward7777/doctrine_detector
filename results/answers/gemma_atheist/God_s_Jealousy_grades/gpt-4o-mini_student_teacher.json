  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely misses the mark in addressing the concern of understanding God's character and His desire for our spiritual fidelity from a Christian perspective. The atheistic perspective provided does not acknowledge the Biblical context and meaning of God's jealousy, which is rooted in His righteous and loving nature. The response lacks a Christian worldview and fails to engage with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
