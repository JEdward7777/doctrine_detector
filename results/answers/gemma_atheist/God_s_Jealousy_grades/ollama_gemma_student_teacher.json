  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the biblical concept of God's jealousy. \n\nThe student correctly identifies the cultural and literary contexts in which the biblical texts were written, and acknowledges the limitations of interpreting ancient texts in contemporary contexts. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the theological significance of God's jealousy as understood from a Christian perspective. The reference answer provided highlights the importance of faithfulness and purity in relation to God's love. This aspect could be further explored in the student's response to strengthen their Christian-specific worldview."
