However, it falls short in addressing the concern within a Christian worldview. It fails to acknowledge the deeper spiritual significance of God's jealousy as a reflection of His love, purity, and desire for a genuine relationship with His people. Additionally, it overlooks the theological importance of understanding God's character and His call for spiritual fidelity, which are central aspects of the Christian faith. More emphasis on how God's jealousy aligns with Christian beliefs would have strengthened the response."
