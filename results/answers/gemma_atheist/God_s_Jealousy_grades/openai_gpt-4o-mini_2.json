However, it falls short of addressing the concern of understanding God's character and His desire for our spiritual fidelity from a Christian worldview. The focus on cultural and literary constructs detracts from the foundational understanding of God's nature and relational expectations with His people as presented in the Bible. A stronger connection to God's attributes and relational dynamics with humanity would have improved the response from a Christian perspective."
