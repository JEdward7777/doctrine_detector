  "grade_comment": "Grade: 5\n\nComment: The student's response completely disregards the Christian context of the question and the importance of the doctrine of justification in salvation. While the student attempts to provide a secular perspective on justification, it misses the mark of addressing the question asked. This response fails to engage with the Christian worldview and does not provide any relevant information on God's justification of sinners as per the Christian doctrine."
