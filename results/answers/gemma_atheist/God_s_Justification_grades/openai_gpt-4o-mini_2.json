  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed exploration of the concept of justification from a secular perspective and within cultural contexts, which is commendable. However, the grade is low as it failed to address the concern of clarifying the Christian doctrine of justification and its importance in salvation. The response did not engage with the given answer on how God justifies sinners in Christianity, missing the opportunity to provide a Christian-specific worldview on the topic. Additionally, from a Christian perspective, the significance of Christ's sacrifice and the role of faith in justification were not discussed."
