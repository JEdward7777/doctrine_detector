  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the cultural, linguistic, and historical aspects of the significance of God's name 'Yahweh' as revealed in the Bible. However, it lacks the theological perspective of the reference answer, which emphasizes the theological significance of the name as representing God's eternal existence and unchanging nature."
