Specifically, the student could have addressed the biblical basis for the belief in God's omnipotence and offered additional insights on how this concept has been understood and interpreted throughout Christian tradition.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that showcases the student's ability to critically analyze religious concepts and articulate their perspective in a clear and well-written manner."
