The response focuses more on deconstructing the term \"Almighty\" rather than engaging with the Christian worldview that views God as all-powerful and sovereign. In a Christian-specific context, it is essential to uphold the belief in God's omnipotence as a central tenet of faith, rather than dismissing it as a cultural construct."
