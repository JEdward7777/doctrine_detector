The approach taken by the student as an atheist scholar lacks the foundational belief in God as the giver of promises and the ultimate authority. The perspectives provided focus solely on social, cultural, and historical interpretations, neglecting to acknowledge the theological significance and divine authority behind God's promises in the Bible. The examples cited lack the essential theological context and spiritual depth necessary to grasp the true significance of God's promises in His relationship with His people. A deeper understanding of the scriptural basis and the covenantal nature of God's promises would have greatly enhanced the response."
