While the perspective offered is valuable in understanding the broader implications of promises in religious narratives, it does not directly address the concern regarding believers' trust in God's faithfulness in their own lives. The response could have been strengthened by acknowledging the impact of God's promises in shaping believers' personal relationships with Him and how understanding these promises can deepen their faith and trust in His faithfulness."
