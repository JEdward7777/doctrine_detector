  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a Christian worldview perspective in addressing how believers can discern what God has planned for them. While the student provides some thoughtful considerations and methods for discernment, they do not emphasize the foundational Christian practices of prayer, Bible reading, seeking counsel from mature Christians, and discerning God's guidance through circumstances. The answer focuses more on cultural, historical, scientific, and ethical perspectives, without grounding the response in a Christian understanding of seeking God's will. A stronger integration of Christian principles and practices related to discerning God's plan would have significantly improved the answer."
