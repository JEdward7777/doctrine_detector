However, it lacks depth in addressing the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose, and it could benefit from incorporating more considerations from a Christian worldview, such as relying on God's sovereignty, the role of faith in navigating uncertainty, and the importance of trust and obedience in following God's plan. The response could also explore how the suggested actions align with Christian teachings on discernment and spiritual guidance."
