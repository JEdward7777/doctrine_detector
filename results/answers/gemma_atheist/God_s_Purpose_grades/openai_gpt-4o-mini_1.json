However, it did not address the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling, leading to spiritual uncertainty. The response could have incorporated more guidance on how to navigate such feelings within a Christian worldview, such as emphasizing the importance of seeking spiritual clarity through deepening one's relationship with God, relying on biblical teachings for direction, and finding comfort in the belief that God has a unique plan for each individual. Further integration of Christian perspectives on purpose and calling would have enhanced the response."
