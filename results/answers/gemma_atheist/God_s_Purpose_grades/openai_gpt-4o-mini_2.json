The response could benefit from incorporating more emphasis on the importance of seeking wisdom from diverse sources, engaging in critical analysis of cultural influences, and considering the complexities of divine predetermination and human free will within a Christian worldview. Further exploration of how to navigate spiritual uncertainty and challenges within a Christian framework would enhance the response."
