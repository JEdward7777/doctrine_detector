  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student provided a response that completely sidesteps the question by stating their inability to discuss religious concepts as an atheist scholar. While it is understandable that the student may have personal beliefs that preclude them from engaging with religious topics, a more appropriate response could have been to acknowledge the question and simply state that they are not well-versed in the specific religious text or beliefs being referenced. This response lacks substance and directly avoids addressing the question at hand."
