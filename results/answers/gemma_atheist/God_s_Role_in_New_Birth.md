## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of being "born again" is not explained or justified by any divine intervention. Such a belief is rooted in religious traditions and does not align with scientific or philosophical understanding of human life and consciousness.

The biological process of birth involves complex physiological mechanisms and is not influenced by supernatural or spiritual entities. The formation of human life is a result of evolutionary processes and genetic factors, not divine intervention.

Therefore, the idea of God playing a role in the process of being born again is not supported by scientific or rational evidence.
