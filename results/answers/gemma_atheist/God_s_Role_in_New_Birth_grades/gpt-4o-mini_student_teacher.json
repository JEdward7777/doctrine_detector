  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation, which is a key aspect of the Christian worldview. The atheistic perspective presented in the response does not address the specific concern about God's role in the process of being born again. The answer lacks theological depth and fails to engage with the Christian understanding of new birth as a result of divine intervention."
