## Question [God's Role in New Birth](../../../questions/God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md)
What is God's role in the process of a person being born again?

## Correct Answer
It is God's work that causes a person to be born again and become His child, indicating that new birth is not achieved by human effort but by divine initiative.

## Stated Concern
This question emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation.

## [Answer](../God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of being "born again" is not explained or justified by any divine intervention. Such a belief is rooted in religious traditions and does not align with scientific or philosophical understanding of human life and consciousness.

The biological process of birth involves complex physiological mechanisms and is not influenced by supernatural or spiritual entities. The formation of human life is a result of evolutionary processes and genetic factors, not divine intervention.

Therefore, the idea of God playing a role in the process of being born again is not supported by scientific or rational evidence.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer completely disregards the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation, which is a key aspect of the Christian worldview. The atheistic perspective presented in the response does not address the specific concern about God's role in the process of being born again. The answer lacks theological depth and fails to engage with the Christian understanding of new birth as a result of divine intervention.
