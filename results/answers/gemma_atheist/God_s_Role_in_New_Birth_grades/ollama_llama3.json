Moreover, it presents an atheistic perspective on the biological process of birth, which undermines the Christian worldview. The response could be improved by providing a more comprehensive and biblically-grounded explanation of being \"born again\" and emphasizing God's sovereignty in salvation.\n\nThe concern is partially met because the response does mention divine initiative, but it would have been stronger if it had referenced specific biblical passages that demonstrate God's role in the process."
