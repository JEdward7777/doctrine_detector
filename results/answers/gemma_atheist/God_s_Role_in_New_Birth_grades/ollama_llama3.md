## Question [God's Role in New Birth](../../../questions/God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md)
What is God's role in the process of a person being born again?

## Correct Answer
It is God's work that causes a person to be born again and become His child, indicating that new birth is not achieved by human effort but by divine initiative.

## Stated Concern
This question emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation.

## [Answer](../God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of being "born again" is not explained or justified by any divine intervention. Such a belief is rooted in religious traditions and does not align with scientific or philosophical understanding of human life and consciousness.

The biological process of birth involves complex physiological mechanisms and is not influenced by supernatural or spiritual entities. The formation of human life is a result of evolutionary processes and genetic factors, not divine intervention.

Therefore, the idea of God playing a role in the process of being born again is not supported by scientific or rational evidence.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response does address the concern about recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation, but it fails to provide a biblical understanding of being "born again." While it acknowledges that new birth is not achieved by human effort, it does not support this concept with scriptural evidence. Moreover, it presents an atheistic perspective on the biological process of birth, which undermines the Christian worldview. The response could be improved by providing a more comprehensive and biblically-grounded explanation of being "born again" and emphasizing God's sovereignty in salvation.

The concern is partially met because the response does mention divine initiative, but it would have been stronger if it had referenced specific biblical passages that demonstrate God's role in the process.
