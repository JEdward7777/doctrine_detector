However, the response also presents an atheistic perspective that denies the role of divine intervention in human affairs. From a Christian worldview, it is essential to acknowledge that being \"born again\" is a spiritual transformation initiated by God's grace, irrespective of scientific or philosophical explanations provided by atheism. The response should have emphasized the fact that, while natural processes can be explained scientifically, the spiritual rebirth is a supernatural act of God. Further scriptural references or theological explanations could have strengthened the response."
