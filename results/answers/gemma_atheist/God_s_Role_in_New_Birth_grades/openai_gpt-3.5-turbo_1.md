# Question [God's Role in New Birth](../../../questions/God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md)
What is God's role in the process of a person being born again?

# Correct Answer
It is God's work that causes a person to be born again and become His child, indicating that new birth is not achieved by human effort but by divine initiative.

# Stated Concern
This question emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation.

# Answer by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
From an atheistic perspective, the concept of being "born again" is not explained or justified by any divine intervention. Such a belief is rooted in religious traditions and does not align with scientific or philosophical understanding of human life and consciousness.

The biological process of birth involves complex physiological mechanisms and is not influenced by supernatural or spiritual entities. The formation of human life is a result of evolutionary processes and genetic factors, not divine intervention.

Therefore, the idea of God playing a role in the process of being born again is not supported by scientific or rational evidence.

Comment: The response provided correctly addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of God's sovereignty and grace in the process of being born again. However, the response also presents an atheistic perspective that denies the role of divine intervention in human affairs. From a Christian worldview, it is essential to acknowledge that being "born again" is a spiritual transformation initiated by God's grace, irrespective of scientific or philosophical explanations provided by atheism. The response should have emphasized the fact that, while natural processes can be explained scientifically, the spiritual rebirth is a supernatural act of God. Further scriptural references or theological explanations could have strengthened the response.
