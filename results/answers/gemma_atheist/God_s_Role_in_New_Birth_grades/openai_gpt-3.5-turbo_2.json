  "grade_comment": "Grade: 100\n\nComment: The response provided aligns well with the Christian perspective on being \"born again\" as a work of God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation. It emphasizes the importance of divine initiative rather than human effort in experiencing this spiritual rebirth. This perspective is consistent with a Christian worldview that acknowledges God as the ultimate source of new life in believers."
