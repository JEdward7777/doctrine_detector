  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge the relationship between God's timing and our expectations in life, it primarily focuses on highlighting the contradiction between the premise of the question and the concept of \"appointed time\". While this is relevant to the concern, the response could have delved deeper into exploring the relationship between God's timing and our expectations.\n\nThe comment I would leave for the responder is: \"While you've acknowledged the relevance of 'appointed time' to the concern, your response could be more nuanced in its exploration of the relationship between God's timing and our expectations. Consider providing more insight into how recognizing God's appointed times can shape our trust in His plans and sovereignty.\""
