The answer focuses on how believers are encouraged to trust in God's timing, but it does not explore the relationship between God's timing and our expectations in life as requested. Additionally, given the Christian worldview, the initial response questioning the relevance of God's appointed time to an atheist scholar could have been addressed more effectively. There is room for improvement in connecting the concepts of God's timing and human expectations within the context of faith."
