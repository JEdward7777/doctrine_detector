  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the belief in God and the concept of divine punishment as understood in Judeo-Christian traditions. It fails to address the question from the perspective of a Christian worldview and instead dismisses it entirely. In grading according to a Christian-specific worldview, the student's response lacks doctrinal correctness and understanding of the significance of the Day of Yahweh in religious beliefs."
