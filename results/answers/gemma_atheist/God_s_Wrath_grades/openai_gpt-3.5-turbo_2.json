  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided by the student diverges significantly from the Christian worldview. As an atheistic scholar, the student dismisses the concept of God's punishment and judgment as culturally constructed and not reflecting objective reality. From a Christian perspective, God's judgment is a foundational belief based on the nature of God as holy and just. The student's emphasis on symbolic interpretations and cultural contexts detracts from the core Christian understanding of God's judgment and consequences for disbelief. Further engagement with Christian theology and perspectives would be beneficial in providing a more nuanced and accurate response."
