However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on how the concept of \"zeal of the Lord\" aligns with specific biblical passages or theological interpretations. Additionally, the student's argument could be strengthened by providing evidence or examples that support their claim that the term is a cultural and religious belief rather than a factual description of God's actions."
