  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of the definitions of godliness in the Bible, including moral character, relationship with God, alignment with God's will, and sacrificial obedience. However, there is a lack of clarity on how to practically incorporate godliness into daily life and actions as per the concern provided. The student could have expanded more on specific ways to apply these principles in everyday situations to better address the concern."
