  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The response fails to engage with the question from a Christian worldview. It dismisses the foundational premise of the question without providing any alternative perspective or insight. A higher grade could have been achieved by respectfully acknowledging the question's context and offering a secular perspective while also addressing the Christian perspective for a well-rounded response."
