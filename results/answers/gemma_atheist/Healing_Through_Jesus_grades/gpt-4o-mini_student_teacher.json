  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 0.\n\nComment: The student's answer completely bypasses the given concern about the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. Their response is more focused on their personal worldview as an atheist scholar rather than engaging with the Christian-specific perspective requested in the concern."
