  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 0\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a blatant disregard for the Christian worldview and the textual basis of their response. They dismiss the supernatural accounts in the Bible without providing any evidence or reasoned argument. This approach is incompatible with the specified concern, which emphasizes the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. The student's answer lacks any engagement with the biblical text or the historical context of Jesus' ministry."
