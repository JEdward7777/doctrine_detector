## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The practice of anointing in the New Testament is not explicitly associated with healing in a culturally retributed way.**

The New Testament accounts of anointing primarily as a ritual act related to ordination, veneration, and remembrance. It does not present it as a primary means of healing or physical restoration.

**Biblical references to anointing in the New Testament:**

* **Ordination:** The apostles were anointed with oil before their ordination (Mark 6:13).
* **Veneration:** Early Christians anointed relics and objects of veneration (I Corinthians 3:16).
* **Remembrance:** The early church practiced anointing with oil as a way to remember the resurrection of Jesus Christ (I Corinthians 15:4).

**Cultural interpretations of anointing for healing:**

It is important to note that cultural interpretations and practices surrounding anointing for healing may vary widely across different contexts and religions. In some cultures, anointing with oil has been associated with healing, but this practice is not directly supported by the New Testament.
