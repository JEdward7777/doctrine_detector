The explanation is accurate in stating that anointing is not explicitly linked to healing in the New Testament. However, the answer could be improved by incorporating examples of anointing for healing in the context of James 5:14-15, where the practice is mentioned in relation to physical restoration. Additionally, a clearer distinction between cultural practices and biblical teachings regarding anointing for healing would enhance the response."
