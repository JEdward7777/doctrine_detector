## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The practice of anointing in the New Testament is not explicitly associated with healing in a culturally retributed way.**

The New Testament accounts of anointing primarily as a ritual act related to ordination, veneration, and remembrance. It does not present it as a primary means of healing or physical restoration.

**Biblical references to anointing in the New Testament:**

* **Ordination:** The apostles were anointed with oil before their ordination (Mark 6:13).
* **Veneration:** Early Christians anointed relics and objects of veneration (I Corinthians 3:16).
* **Remembrance:** The early church practiced anointing with oil as a way to remember the resurrection of Jesus Christ (I Corinthians 15:4).

**Cultural interpretations of anointing for healing:**

It is important to note that cultural interpretations and practices surrounding anointing for healing may vary widely across different contexts and religions. In some cultures, anointing with oil has been associated with healing, but this practice is not directly supported by the New Testament.

Comment: The response presents a comprehensive overview of anointing in the New Testament, highlighting its association with ordination, veneration, and remembrance. The explanation is accurate in stating that anointing is not explicitly linked to healing in the New Testament. However, the answer could be improved by incorporating examples of anointing for healing in the context of James 5:14-15, where the practice is mentioned in relation to physical restoration. Additionally, a clearer distinction between cultural practices and biblical teachings regarding anointing for healing would enhance the response.
