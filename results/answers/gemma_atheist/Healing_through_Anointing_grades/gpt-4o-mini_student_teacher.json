  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-organized explanation of anointing in the New Testament but overlooked the explicit association of anointing with healing in the reference answer. It is essential to recognize the scriptural basis for anointing in relation to seeking healing and God's intervention, which was not addressed in the student's response."
