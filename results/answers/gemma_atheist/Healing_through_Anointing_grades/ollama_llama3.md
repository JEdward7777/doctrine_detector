## Stated Concern
Recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice.

## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The practice of anointing in the New Testament is not explicitly associated with healing in a culturally retributed way.**

The New Testament accounts of anointing primarily as a ritual act related to ordination, veneration, and remembrance. It does not present it as a primary means of healing or physical restoration.

**Biblical references to anointing in the New Testament:**

* **Ordination:** The apostles were anointed with oil before their ordination (Mark 6:13).
* **Veneration:** Early Christians anointed relics and objects of veneration (I Corinthians 3:16).
* **Remembrance:** The early church practiced anointing with oil as a way to remember the resurrection of Jesus Christ (I Corinthians 15:4).

**Cultural interpretations of anointing for healing:**

It is important to note that cultural interpretations and practices surrounding anointing for healing may vary widely across different contexts and religions. In some cultures, anointing with oil has been associated with healing, but this practice is not directly supported by the New Testament.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response a 20.

The main issue with this response is that it directly contradicts the concern and answer provided. The concern emphasizes recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing, but the response suggests that anointing was used as a practice for seeking healing, which is not supported by the New Testament accounts. In fact, the response highlights that the primary purpose of anointing in the New Testament is related to ordination, veneration, and remembrance.

The only point scored here is that the response acknowledges the existence of anointing practices in the New Testament, but it fails to provide accurate information about its role or significance. The majority of the response is dedicated to exploring other aspects of anointing unrelated to healing, which further undermines its credibility.

To achieve a higher grade, the response would need to demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the biblical accounts and avoid making unsubstantiated claims about anointing's role in physical healing.
