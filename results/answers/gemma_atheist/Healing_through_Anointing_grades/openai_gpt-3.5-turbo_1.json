The additional information provided about anointing in the New Testament is informative, but the response could be strengthened by connecting the practice of anointing more explicitly to the Christian belief in God's intervention and healing power through this act. The response would benefit from emphasizing the significance of anointing in both spiritual and physical healing within a Christian worldview."
