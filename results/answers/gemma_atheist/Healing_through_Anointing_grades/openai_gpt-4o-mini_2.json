However, the response failed to adequately address the concern raised about anointing in the context of seeking healing as a practice for God's intervention and healing power. It missed the opportunity to emphasize the spiritual and physical healing aspects associated with anointing in Christian practice. A more comprehensive integration of the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing from a Christian worldview perspective would have strengthened the response."
