However, the concern highlights the deeper significance of the high priest's role in facilitating the relationship between the Israelites and God through the covenant. A Christian worldview would emphasize the importance of the high priest's intercessory role in representing the people before God and carrying out the rituals of atonement, thereby pointing towards the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the covenant through His sacrifice. The response lacks this theological depth and connection to the Christian understanding of priesthood and covenantal relationships."
