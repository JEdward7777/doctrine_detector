  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response accurately acknowledges the role of the high priest as the only individual permitted to approach the ark of the covenant. However, the concern raised highlights the significance of the high priest's role in mediating the relationship between the Israelites and God through the covenant. Since the response does not address this vital aspect from a Christian perspective, it only receives a partial grade."
