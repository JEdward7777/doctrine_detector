## Biblical Events Illustrating the Concept of 'Remnant'

In both Isaiah and Amos, the concept of "remnant" resonates deeply with the cultural contexts in which these prophets spoke. Understanding these cultural contexts is crucial for interpreting the meaning of "remnant" in these texts.

**Isaiah:**
