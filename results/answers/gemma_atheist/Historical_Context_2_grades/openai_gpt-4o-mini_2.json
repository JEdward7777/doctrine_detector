However, the concern about recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices is not fully addressed in the response, as it dismisses the traditional account without acknowledging the religious significance and historical context surrounding the practice of eating unleavened bread. It would be beneficial to acknowledge the intersection of faith and history in shaping religious practices."
