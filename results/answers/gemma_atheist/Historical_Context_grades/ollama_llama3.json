  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of \"remnant\" in both Isaiah and Amos, exploring its cultural significance and biblical context. The discussion of exile, restoration prophecies, and the Suffering Servant is particularly strong, demonstrating a good understanding of the historical context and the prophet's message.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are:\n\n1. The response could delve deeper into the specific historical events that led to the concept of \"remnant\" in Isaiah and Amos. While it provides some background information on the cultural context, it would be beneficial to explore this further.\n2. There is an opportunity to more explicitly connect the concept of \"remnant\" to God's promises and covenant with His people. While this is implied throughout the response, a more direct exploration of how this concept relates to God's commitments would strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical concept of \"remnant\" and its significance in relation to God's promises."
