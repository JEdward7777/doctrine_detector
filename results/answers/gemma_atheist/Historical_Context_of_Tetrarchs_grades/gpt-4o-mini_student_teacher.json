They address various facets such as political decentralization, increased local autonomy, economic and social differentiation, security concerns, rise of local heroism, cultural and religious diversification, contact with non-Jewish cultures, and political marginalization. However, the response lacks a clear focus on how these impacts specifically relate to the socio-political dynamics faced by Jesus and the early church. It is important to connect the implications of the tetrarchies directly to understanding the context in which Jesus and the early church operated."
