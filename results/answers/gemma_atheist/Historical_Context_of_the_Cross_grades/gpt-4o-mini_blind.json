  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a solid overview of how the Roman practice of crucifixion affected the perception of the cross in early Christianity. The student effectively highlights the repudiation of pagan practices, the symbolic significance of the cross, the distancing from pagan symbolism, the cultural context and interpretation, the transformation of the cross, and the cultural influences on interpretations. \n\nOne area for improvement could be to delve deeper into the theological implications of Christ's crucifixion and how it was understood in a salvific context within early Christianity. Additionally, connecting the concept of atonement and redemption more explicitly to the symbolism of the cross would have strengthened the analysis. Overall, a well-rounded response with room for enhanced theological depth."
