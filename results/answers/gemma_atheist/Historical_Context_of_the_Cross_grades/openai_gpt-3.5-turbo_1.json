The points made about the repudiation of pagan practices, the symbolic significance of the cross, the distancing from pagan symbolism, and the cultural influences on interpretations all support the idea of the cross' transformation in early Christianity. However, a clearer link could have been made between the Roman practice of crucifixion and how it specifically influenced the transformation of the cross into a symbol of life and hope. Overall, a strong and well-supported analysis."
