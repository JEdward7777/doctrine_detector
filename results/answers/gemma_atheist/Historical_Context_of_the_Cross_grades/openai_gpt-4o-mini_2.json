It provides insightful discussion on how early Christianity distanced itself from pagan practices, the symbolic significance of the cross, and the cultural context surrounding the use of crucifixion by the Romans. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how the Christian message has transformed the meaning of the cross. Great analysis and integration of Christian worldview perspectives."
