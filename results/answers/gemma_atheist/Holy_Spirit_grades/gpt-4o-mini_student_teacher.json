  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response covers a wide range of relevant aspects such as contextual understanding, metaphorical language, personal experience, universal principles, ethical considerations, shared values, and encouraging inquiry, they lack direct alignment with the concern provided. The concern emphasizes the importance of clear, contextual teaching to prevent misconceptions about the Holy Spirit's identity and work. The student's response does not directly address this concern and instead focuses on introducing the Holy Spirit in a more general and accommodating manner. The reference answer from the teacher provides a succinct and clear approach that directly addresses the concern, which the student's response falls short of."
