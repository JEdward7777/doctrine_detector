**In scripture, the term "hosts" encompasses:**

**1. Angelic Hosts:**

* Revelation 5:11 speaks of "a great multitude...of angels standing before the throne."
* These angels are described as "hosts" because they are a numerous and powerful group.

**2. Heavenly Hosts:**

* Colossians 1:16 refers to "the spirits of the just made perfect" as "a heavenly host."
* This implies a spiritual realm filled with beings who are aligned with God.

**3. Human Hosts:**

* In various passages, God is said to have "hosts" of people who are faithful to him. 
* Examples include:
    * Judges 5:10 - "The people...became valiant warriors, all the valiant warriors were gathered together as a host."
    * 1 Samuel 17:4 - "There went out from the hill of Ephraim...a mighty host."

**4. Cosmic Hosts:**

* Some interpretations of passages suggest a broader concept of "hosts" that encompasses all created beings, including the stars and planets.


**Cultural Considerations:**

* The term "hosts" is used in a variety of cultural and religious contexts, and its meaning can vary depending on the specific setting.
* In some cultures, the term may have connotations of spiritualism or paganism. 
* It is important to consider the cultural and historical context of the scripture when interpreting the term "hosts."

**As an atheistic scholar, I would approach the term "hosts" as a metaphor or symbolic representation rather than a literal description of physical beings.**
