  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the term \"hosts\" in scripture, covering angelic hosts, heavenly hosts, human hosts, and cosmic hosts. The incorporation of relevant biblical references is commendable. However, the student's insertion of the atheistic scholar's perspective at the end detracts from the overall doctrinal correctness of the response within a Christian worldview. In a Christian-specific grading, this should not align with the doctrinal standpoint upheld in scriptural interpretation."
