  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"hosts\" and included scriptural references to support their points, they veered off course by including a perspective from an atheistic scholar at the end of the answer. From a Christian worldview, it is important to maintain a consistent biblical perspective throughout the response without introducing perspectives that undermine the authority of Scripture. The student's answer was well-written and demonstrated a good understanding of the term \"hosts,\" but the inclusion of the atheistic perspective detracts from the overall coherence of the answer."
