  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately describes the various meanings of the term \"hosts\" in scripture, including angelic hosts, heavenly hosts, human hosts, and cosmic hosts. It also acknowledges the importance of considering cultural and historical context when interpreting the term. The only area for improvement is that the response could provide more insight into how understanding the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority can impact a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles.\n\nThe provided answer aligns well with the response, as both describe the various meanings of \"hosts\" in scripture. However, the concern about understanding the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority is not fully addressed in the response."
