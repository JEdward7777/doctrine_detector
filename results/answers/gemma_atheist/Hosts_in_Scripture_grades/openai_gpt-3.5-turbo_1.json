The inclusion of cultural considerations adds depth to the interpretation. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the concern regarding spiritual warfare and divine authority in the Christian worldview. Emphasizing the significance of understanding these aspects in the context of prayer and spiritual battles from a Christian perspective would have strengthened the response further."
