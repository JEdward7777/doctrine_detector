Grade: 72

Comment: The student's response provides practical advice on addressing feelings of jealousy in relationships from a culturally sensitive perspective. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer falls short in addressing the theological aspects of jealousy, particularly in how it can be a manifestation of sinful desires such as covetousness or lack of contentment. Incorporating biblical principles and the importance of seeking God's help in overcoming jealousy would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response. Additionally, emphasizing the role of forgiveness, grace, and humility in dealing with jealousy within the context of Christian relationships would further align the answer with a Christian worldview.
