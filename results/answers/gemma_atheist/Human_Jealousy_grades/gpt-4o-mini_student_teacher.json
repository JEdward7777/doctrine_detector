  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. \n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach to responding to feelings of jealousy in relationships, their focus is more on understanding, navigating, and reframing jealousy rather than directly addressing the concern of reflecting on personal relationships and the impact of jealousy on them. The provided answer offers valuable insights on addressing jealousy but falls slightly short of directly connecting these strategies to the impact on personal relationships.\n\nEncouraging the student to tie their suggestions more explicitly to the specific concern of analyzing how jealousy affects personal relationships could enhance the relevance and effectiveness of their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
