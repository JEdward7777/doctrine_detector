However, the response could be more comprehensive by incorporating the steps provided in the original list, such as exploring underlying issues, reframing jealousy, and promoting self-awareness and growth. Additionally, while the response recognizes the importance of open communication and trust, it does not specifically address cultural norms, social media, or gender roles that can influence jealousy dynamics. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the negative consequences of jealousy and the need for healthy communication in relationships."
