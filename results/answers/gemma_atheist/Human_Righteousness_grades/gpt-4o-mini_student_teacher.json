  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer on how a person can be declared righteous according to the Christian faith. They effectively highlighted the biblical teachings on righteousness as a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ. The student also addressed the components of Christian righteousness, emphasizing faith, repentance, love for God, and goodness towards others. However, the student could strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting the concept of God's cleansing from sins and the attribution of Jesus' righteousness to believers, as outlined in the reference answer. This will help further clarify the basis for human righteousness in relation to faith in Jesus for salvation."
