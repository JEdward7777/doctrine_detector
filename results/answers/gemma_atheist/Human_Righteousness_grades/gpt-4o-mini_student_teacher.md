## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**According to the Christian faith, righteousness is not defined by human actions or merit.** It is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ. 

The Bible teaches that:

* **"Righteousness is the gift of God, not by works so that no one can boast."** (Romans 3:24)
* **"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast."** (Ephesians 2:8)

**Christian righteousness involves:**

* **Faith in Jesus Christ:** Accepting his sacrifice as payment for our sins.
* **Repentance:** Turning away from sin and following God's commands.
* **Love for God:** Having a deep affection for God and his people.
* **Goodness to others:** Showing kindness, compassion, and justice in our actions.

**The Christian concept of righteousness emphasizes:**

* **Grace:** God's unconditional love and forgiveness.
* **Justification:** Being declared innocent of sin and receiving God's approval.
* **Sanctification:** Growing in Christ-likeness and becoming more holy.

**Therefore, a person is declared righteous in the Christian faith by receiving God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ.**

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer on how a person can be declared righteous according to the Christian faith. They effectively highlighted the biblical teachings on righteousness as a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ. The student also addressed the components of Christian righteousness, emphasizing faith, repentance, love for God, and goodness towards others. However, the student could strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting the concept of God's cleansing from sins and the attribution of Jesus' righteousness to believers, as outlined in the reference answer. This will help further clarify the basis for human righteousness in relation to faith in Jesus for salvation.
