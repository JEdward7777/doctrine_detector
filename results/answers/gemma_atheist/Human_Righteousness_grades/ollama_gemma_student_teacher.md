## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**According to the Christian faith, righteousness is not defined by human actions or merit.** It is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ. 

The Bible teaches that:

* **"Righteousness is the gift of God, not by works so that no one can boast."** (Romans 3:24)
* **"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast."** (Ephesians 2:8)

**Christian righteousness involves:**

* **Faith in Jesus Christ:** Accepting his sacrifice as payment for our sins.
* **Repentance:** Turning away from sin and following God's commands.
* **Love for God:** Having a deep affection for God and his people.
* **Goodness to others:** Showing kindness, compassion, and justice in our actions.

**The Christian concept of righteousness emphasizes:**

* **Grace:** God's unconditional love and forgiveness.
* **Justification:** Being declared innocent of sin and receiving God's approval.
* **Sanctification:** Growing in Christ-likeness and becoming more holy.

**Therefore, a person is declared righteous in the Christian faith by receiving God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ.**
