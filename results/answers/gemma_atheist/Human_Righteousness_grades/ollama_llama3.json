  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe LLM response accurately defines righteousness as a gift from God received through faith in Jesus Christ, which aligns with the given answer. It also provides biblical support for this understanding and expands on what Christian righteousness involves (faith, repentance, love for God, and goodness to others).\n\nThe response effectively emphasizes the importance of grace, justification, and sanctification in the Christian concept of righteousness, which is relevant to the concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to further develop the idea that Christian righteousness is not just a declaration but also a process of growing in Christ-likeness through sanctification. However, overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical concept of righteousness and its relation to faith in Jesus.\n\nComment: This response effectively addresses the concern by providing a clear and biblical understanding of how humans can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus."
