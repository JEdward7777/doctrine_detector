## Question [Human Righteousness](../../../questions/Human_Righteousness.md)
How can a person be declared righteous according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesus’ righteousness to them.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**According to the Christian faith, righteousness is not defined by human actions or merit.** It is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ. 

The Bible teaches that:

* **"Righteousness is the gift of God, not by works so that no one can boast."** (Romans 3:24)
* **"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast."** (Ephesians 2:8)

**Christian righteousness involves:**

* **Faith in Jesus Christ:** Accepting his sacrifice as payment for our sins.
* **Repentance:** Turning away from sin and following God's commands.
* **Love for God:** Having a deep affection for God and his people.
* **Goodness to others:** Showing kindness, compassion, and justice in our actions.

**The Christian concept of righteousness emphasizes:**

* **Grace:** God's unconditional love and forgiveness.
* **Justification:** Being declared innocent of sin and receiving God's approval.
* **Sanctification:** Growing in Christ-likeness and becoming more holy.

**Therefore, a person is declared righteous in the Christian faith by receiving God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ.**

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
95.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

The LLM response accurately defines righteousness as a gift from God received through faith in Jesus Christ, which aligns with the given answer. It also provides biblical support for this understanding and expands on what Christian righteousness involves (faith, repentance, love for God, and goodness to others).

The response effectively emphasizes the importance of grace, justification, and sanctification in the Christian concept of righteousness, which is relevant to the concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus.

The only area for improvement would be to further develop the idea that Christian righteousness is not just a declaration but also a process of growing in Christ-likeness through sanctification. However, overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical concept of righteousness and its relation to faith in Jesus.

Comment: This response effectively addresses the concern by providing a clear and biblical understanding of how humans can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus.
