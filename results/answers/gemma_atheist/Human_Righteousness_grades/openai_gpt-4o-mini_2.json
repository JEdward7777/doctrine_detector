  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the Christian concept of righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. It effectively clarifies the basis for human righteousness in relation to trusting in Jesus for salvation, emphasizing the cleansing from sin and the attribution of Jesus' righteousness. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses and key elements of Christian righteousness adds to the theological depth of the explanation. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly linking the response to the need for understanding salvation in the context of faith in Jesus. Overall, a solid response with room for slight improvement in addressing the specified concern more directly."
