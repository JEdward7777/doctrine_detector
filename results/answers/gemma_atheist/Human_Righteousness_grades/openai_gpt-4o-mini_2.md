## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**According to the Christian faith, righteousness is not defined by human actions or merit.** It is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ. 

The Bible teaches that:

* **"Righteousness is the gift of God, not by works so that no one can boast."** (Romans 3:24)
* **"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God—not by works so that no one can boast."** (Ephesians 2:8)

**Christian righteousness involves:**

* **Faith in Jesus Christ:** Accepting his sacrifice as payment for our sins.
* **Repentance:** Turning away from sin and following God's commands.
* **Love for God:** Having a deep affection for God and his people.
* **Goodness to others:** Showing kindness, compassion, and justice in our actions.

**The Christian concept of righteousness emphasizes:**

* **Grace:** God's unconditional love and forgiveness.
* **Justification:** Being declared innocent of sin and receiving God's approval.
* **Sanctification:** Growing in Christ-likeness and becoming more holy.

**Therefore, a person is declared righteous in the Christian faith by receiving God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ.**

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of the Christian concept of righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. It effectively clarifies the basis for human righteousness in relation to trusting in Jesus for salvation, emphasizing the cleansing from sin and the attribution of Jesus' righteousness. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses and key elements of Christian righteousness adds to the theological depth of the explanation. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly linking the response to the need for understanding salvation in the context of faith in Jesus. Overall, a solid response with room for slight improvement in addressing the specified concern more directly.
