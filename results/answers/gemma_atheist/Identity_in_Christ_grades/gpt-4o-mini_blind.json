However, from a Christian worldview, this answer falls short as it completely disregards the theological significance behind God calling individuals by name. It fails to address the personal and intimate relationship aspect that is central to the Christian faith. The answer focuses more on cultural, psychological, and metaphorical interpretations, missing the core theological implications of being called by God. In a Christian-specific worldview, it is essential to highlight that being called by name by God signifies a unique, personal relationship, and a divine invitation to follow Him."
