The answer emphasizes God's personal knowledge of each individual and His desire for a relationship, which is central to understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. The atheistic perspective and alternative interpretations provided do not address the concern in a way that affirms the significance of being called by name by God in Christian faith."
