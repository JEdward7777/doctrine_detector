However, it lacks a crucial element in a Christian-specific worldview - the core doctrinal understanding of Jesus as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity. The focus on cultural symbolism and historical interpretations, while interesting, does not fully address the central purpose of Jesus as the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation. In a Christian worldview, the centrality of Jesus as the divine Son of God, the Redeemer, and the source of eternal life would greatly enhance the response."
