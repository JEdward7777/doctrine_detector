The perspective of approaching the Bible from an atheistic standpoint may hinder a full understanding and application of the seriousness of straying from God's commandments. The response could be strengthened by integrating specific Christian teachings on idolatry and emphasizing the importance of repentance and loyalty to God in order to align more closely with the concern provided."
