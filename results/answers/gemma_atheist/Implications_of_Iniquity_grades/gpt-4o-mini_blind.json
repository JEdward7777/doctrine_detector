  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This answer provides a well-rounded and thoughtful exploration of how understanding injustice as harmful acts influences a Christian's behavior toward others. The student effectively articulates the shift from a retributive model of justice to a restorative perspective, highlighting the ethical implications, responsibility for social injustice, the call to active response, and the focus on reconciliation and transformation. The answer appropriately addresses potential challenges and offers practical applications for interpersonal relationships, social activism, and public policy. To enhance the response, the student could deepen the theological underpinning of restorative justice within Christian doctrine, and perhaps include scriptural references to support their points."
