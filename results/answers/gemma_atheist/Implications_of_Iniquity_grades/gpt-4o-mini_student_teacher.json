  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive exploration of how understanding injustice as harmful acts influences Christian behavior, encompassing reconceptualizing justice, ethical implications, responsibility for social injustice, active response, and reconciliation. The analysis is well-supported with examples and potential challenges. The student effectively connects these points to the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation within the Christian community. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly relating each point to the practice of forgiveness and reconciliation, as per the specified concern. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and presents thoughtful insights from a Christian worldview."
