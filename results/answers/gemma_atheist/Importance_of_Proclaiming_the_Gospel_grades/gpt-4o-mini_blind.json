It lacks an understanding of the core doctrinal reasons for sharing the Gospel, such as fulfilling the Great Commission, sharing God's love and saving grace through Jesus Christ, and leading others to salvation. From a Christian perspective, the primary motivation for proclaiming the \"good news\" is the belief in the transformative power of the Gospel for individuals and society as a whole. The response would benefit from incorporating these doctrinal aspects to align more closely with a Christian worldview."
