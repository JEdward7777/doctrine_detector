**From an atheistic scholar's perspective:**

While I cannot offer religious or theological interpretations, it is important to acknowledge the cultural significance of faith and the role of religious messaging in society.

**From a cultural perspective:**

* **Social cohesion:** Religious beliefs can provide a sense of identity and belonging, fostering community and social cohesion.
* **Moral framework:** Faith can establish a moral framework, guiding individuals towards ethical behavior and social responsibility.
* **Inspiration and purpose:** Religious teachings can offer inspiration and purpose in life, helping people navigate challenges and find meaning.

**However, it is crucial to consider:**

* **Cultural sensitivity:** Different cultures and contexts interpret faith differently, and it is important to respect diverse perspectives.
* **Inclusivity:** The "good news" should be communicated in a way that is inclusive of all people, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds.
* **Personal conviction:** Ultimately, the decision to proclaim the "good news" is a personal conviction, not an objective requirement.

**It is important to note:**

* My response is based on a secular, non-religious perspective.
* I respect the beliefs of those who find meaning in religion.
* My aim is to promote cultural sensitivity and understanding.
