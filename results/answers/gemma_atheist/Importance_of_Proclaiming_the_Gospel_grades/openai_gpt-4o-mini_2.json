The atheistic and cultural perspectives presented lack the acknowledgment of the uniqueness and centrality of the Christian faith in proclaiming the message of salvation. There is a need for a deeper understanding and affirmation of the Christian belief in the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus Christ."
