  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough analysis of the influence of the Sadducees and Pharisees on Jesus' crucifixion, highlighting key differences in their beliefs and motivations. However, there is a lack of direct connection to the teacher's reference answer which emphasizes the selfishness and hypocrisy of the religious leaders. The student could strengthen their answer by explicitly linking their points to how selfishness and hypocrisy played a role in influencing the decision to crucify Jesus. Additionally, while the student effectively discusses the character implications of the Sadducees and Pharisees, tying these traits back to their influence on the crucifixion decision would enhance the coherence of the response."
