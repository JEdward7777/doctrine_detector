## Influence on Jesus' Crucifixion:

**Sadducees:**

* Denied the existence of a spirit world, including angels and ghosts.
* Would not have believed in resurrection or divine intervention.
* Their disbelief could have contributed to the pressure to execute Jesus, seen as a potential threat to their ideology.


**Pharisees:**

* Adhered to strict interpretations of religious law, including the resurrection of the dead.
* Their concern was not with Jesus' divinity, but with his potential violation of religious laws.
* Their legalistic approach could have led to the crucifixion as a means of upholding their interpretation of the law.


## Character Implications:

**Sadducees:**

* Focused solely on this physical world, neglecting spiritual concerns.
* Willing to suppress or even eliminate anyone who challenged their materialistic worldview.
* Lacked compassion for Jesus' suffering, suggesting a callous disregard for human life.

**Pharisees:**

* Strictly adhered to tradition but could be intolerant of new interpretations.
* Employed legalistic reasoning to justify their actions, even when harsh.
* Their emphasis on upholding religious law could sometimes overshadow human compassion.


**Common Traits:**

* Both groups prioritized their own beliefs and interpretations above the needs of others.
* Both played a role in creating an environment where Jesus' radical teachings were seen as a threat.
* Their actions reveal a tendency to prioritize legalistic interpretations of their faith over genuine understanding and compassion.


## Additional Considerations:

* The influence of these two groups on Jesus' crucifixion was likely complex and multifaceted.
* Other factors, such as political and social pressures, also played a role in the decision.
* The historical context should be considered when evaluating the actions of these ancient groups.
