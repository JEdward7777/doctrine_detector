  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 0\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a blatant disregard for the Christian worldview and its understanding of the covenant between God and Abraham. The response is essentially an expression of methodological atheism, rejecting the very possibility of supernatural intervention or religious belief. This approach is fundamentally incompatible with the premise of the question and fails to engage with the assigned concern related to understanding God's covenant with Abraham."
