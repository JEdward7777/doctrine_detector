  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe response completely misses the concern about clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. Instead, it provides an irrelevant statement about its limitations as an AI model. It does not engage with the specific passage or the concern at all, let alone provide any insight into the teachings of Jesus on the topic.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response would need to demonstrate some understanding of and engagement with the concern and the provided answer, even if it's just a brief comment that acknowledges the question and sets the stage for further exploration."
