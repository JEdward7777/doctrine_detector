Instead, it explicitly stated a limitation to providing religious interpretations based on faith-based beliefs. In a Christian context, it is essential to consider the teachings of Jesus when discussing topics related to salvation and eternal life. Further exploration and connection to Christian beliefs and teachings would greatly enhance the response."
