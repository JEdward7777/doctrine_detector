Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided a clear and direct biblical reference to Jesus' teachings, emphasizing the importance of following His guidance for inheriting eternal life. However, the initial response stating a limitation to only secular knowledge and reasoning reflects a lack of willingness to engage with religious interpretations from a Christian worldview. It is important to be open to considering faith-based beliefs when discussing topics related to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus.
