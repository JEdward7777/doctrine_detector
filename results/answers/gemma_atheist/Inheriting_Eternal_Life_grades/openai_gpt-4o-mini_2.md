Comment: This response is not satisfactory as it fails to engage with the concern of clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus from a Christian perspective. It dismisses the importance of faith-based beliefs in addressing this specific concern, which is crucial when discussing matters of salvation according to Christian worldview.
