  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive list of examples of injustices prevalent in the world today and offers a well-rounded range of Christian responses to address these issues. The suggestions for advocacy, compassion, justice-seeking, personal transformation, and reconciliation align well with biblical principles. However, the student could enhance their response by strengthening the connection between the examples of injustice provided and the biblical mandate for Christians to actively combat injustice. Additionally, incorporating more specific biblical references or theological foundations to support the proposed responses would further strengthen the answer."
