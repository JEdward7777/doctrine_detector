  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern by providing examples of injustice and highlighting the importance of Christian activism against these wrongs. The suggestions for advocacy, care, and transformation are all biblical principles that align with the call to justice in Matthew 25:31-46. The recognition of the need for cultural sensitivity and collaboration with non-Christian perspectives also shows an understanding of the complexity of addressing injustice.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger by providing more specific biblical examples or passages that support the call to justice. Additionally, while it mentions advocacy and action, it does not provide concrete steps or strategies for Christians to engage in these efforts.\n\nOverall, this response provides a good foundation for understanding the need for Christian activism against injustice and promoting fairness based on biblical principles."
