## Impact of our responses to God on His will for our lives:

**1. Willingness and surrender:**

- Our responses can express genuine humility and acceptance of God's will, leading to peaceful coexistence.

- Responses that advocate for compassion, justice, and love align with universal ethical principles.
- Such responses can foster positive social change and promote peaceful coexistence within communities.

**3. Mental and emotional well-being:**

- Denying the need for God can alleviate unnecessary mental distress and existential anxieties.
- This freedom can empower individuals to take ownership of their lives and destinies.

- This process can lead to greater self-awareness and a deeper understanding of human values and potential.

**5. Respectful dialogue:**
