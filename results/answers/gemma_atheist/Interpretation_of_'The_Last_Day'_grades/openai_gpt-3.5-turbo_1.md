# Answer by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**In Christian teaching, "the last day" refers to the ultimate culmination of history, when Jesus Christ will return in glory and establish his eternal kingdom.** This event is believed to be:

* **A literal return:** Jesus will physically descend from heaven to earth and establish his reign.
* **A cosmic event:** The heavens and earth will undergo a dramatic transformation, with the wicked being judged and the righteous receiving eternal life.
* **A transformative moment:** For believers, "the last day" will be a day of perfect peace, joy, and fulfillment.

**However, there are different interpretations among scholars and theologians regarding the precise meaning and significance of "the last day":**

* **Historical premillennialism:** This view suggests that "the last day" is a future event, culminating in the Second Coming of Christ and the establishment of a literal millennium-long reign.
* **Symbolic premillennialism:** This perspective views "the last day" as a symbolic representation of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death.
* **Progressive Christianity:** This approach rejects the idea of a literal Second Coming or millennium, arguing that Christ's reign is already ongoing in the hearts of believers.

**As an atheistic scholar, I approach this concept from a non-religious perspective:**

* **Lack of empirical evidence:** There is no scientific or historical evidence to support the claims of Christian eschatology.
* **Cultural and historical influence:** The concept of "the last day" is culturally and historically constructed, and its interpretation has evolved over time.
* **Alternative perspectives:** There are many other philosophical and spiritual perspectives on the nature of time and the ultimate destiny of humanity that do not rely on Christian teachings.

Comment: The response provided does not align with Christian teachings that emphasize the last day as the culmination of history with Jesus Christ's return and establishment of His eternal kingdom. In a Christian worldview, understanding judgment as part of the last day is indeed crucial for one's relationship with God and the urgency of faith. The provided response contradicts this Christian belief by presenting a different interpretation that is not consistent with the specific concern provided.
