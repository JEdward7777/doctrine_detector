  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of \"the last day\" within Christian teaching. They provide a detailed explanation of the various interpretations among scholars and theologians, while also acknowledging the lack of empirical evidence from an atheistic perspective. The answer clearly articulates the traditional Christian belief in judgment and redemption. \n\nHowever, the student's inclusion of their own non-religious perspective, particularly their critique of Christian eschatology, lowers the overall grade slightly."
