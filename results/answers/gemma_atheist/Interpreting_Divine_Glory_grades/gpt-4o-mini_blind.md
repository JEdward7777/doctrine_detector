Comments: 

This answer approaches the question from a very relativistic and secular perspective, downplaying the transcendent and objective nature of divine glory. While acknowledging cultural influences and diversity is important, the answer fails to emphasize the biblical understanding of divine glory as revealed in the Christian faith. It lacks a clear connection to the biblical teachings on worship and the glory of God. The response also falls short in not addressing the unique Christian perspective on divine glory, such as how it is manifested in the person of Jesus Christ. It is essential to ground discussions of divine glory in the truth of Scripture and the centrality of God in worship.
