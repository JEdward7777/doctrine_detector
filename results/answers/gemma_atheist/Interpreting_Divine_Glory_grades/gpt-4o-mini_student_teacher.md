## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as a 65.

While the student's response addresses various aspects related to the understanding of "divine glory" in worship, such as cultural influences, transcendental experience, symbolic representation, transformation, cultural diversity, ethical considerations, and personal interpretation, there are concerns from a Christian worldview.

The student's answer does not directly align with a Christian perspective as it lacks a clear emphasis on the biblical understanding of 'divine glory' as the magnificent and radiant nature of God. While the student encourages diverse interpretations and personal reflections, it is important to anchor these within the foundational Christian belief of the transcendent nature of God's glory. Additionally, the response could benefit from incorporating scriptural references or theological insights to support the interpretation of 'divine glory' within the Christian context.

Therefore, the grade reflects a thoughtful exploration of the topic but would be improved by integrating a more explicitly Christian perspective.
