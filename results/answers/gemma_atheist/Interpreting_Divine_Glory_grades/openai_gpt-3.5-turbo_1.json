  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive understanding of 'divine glory' within the context of worship, focusing on cultural influences, transcendental experience, symbolic representation, transformation, cultural diversity, ethical considerations, and personal interpretation. The answer given aligns well with the concern about recognizing God's glory in worship practices. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique and central belief of Christians that 'divine glory' is specifically linked to the nature of God as revealed in His presence, which influences Christian worship practices and expressions of reverence and awe. It is important to explicitly connect the provided understanding with the Christian worldview to fully address the concern given."
