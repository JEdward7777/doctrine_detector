  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively recognizes the importance of acknowledging God's glory in worship practices, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The suggestions provided on understanding 'Divine Glory' in the Context of Worship demonstrate a respectful approach to cultural influences and diverse interpretations while emphasizing the transformative power of experiencing God's glory. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the uniqueness and centrality of the Christian understanding of 'divine glory' as revealed in the nature of God through Jesus Christ."
