  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the term \"high\" in the title \"Most High.\" They acknowledge the cultural and historical relativity of the term while offering insightful interpretations related to spiritual transcendence, cosmic elevation, and cultural symbolism. The conclusion appropriately emphasizes the importance of sensitivity and open-mindedness when interpreting such terminology. \n\nHowever, the response would benefit from a more direct engagement with the teacher's reference answer, which explicitly connects \"high\" to greatness and authority. The student could have elaborated on the connection between the two concepts and provided additional theological or textual evidence to support their interpretation."
