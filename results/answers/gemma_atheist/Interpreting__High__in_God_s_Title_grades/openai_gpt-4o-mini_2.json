However, the atheistic perspective overlooks the Christian worldview that 'Most High' signifies God's supremacy and authority, and the analysis lacks consideration of the metaphorical use of descriptive titles when understanding God's nature. The response could benefit from acknowledging the Christian perspective on the meaning of 'Most High' and addressing the concern of avoiding misconceptions about God's nature."
