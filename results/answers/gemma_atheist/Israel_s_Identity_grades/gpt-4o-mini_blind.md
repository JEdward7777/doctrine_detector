Comment: The response provides a good overview of the different aspects of the name "Israel" in its biblical context. However, the inclusion of the viewpoint of an atheistic scholar at the end could potentially undermine the importance and sacred nature of the name "Israel" within a Christian worldview. It's crucial to uphold the significance of biblical narratives without diluting them with opposing viewpoints when discussing their meanings.
