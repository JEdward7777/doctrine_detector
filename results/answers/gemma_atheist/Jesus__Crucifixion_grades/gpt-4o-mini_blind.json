While it acknowledges different cultural and historical contexts, it lacks a clear focus on the Christian worldview. The answer would benefit from emphasizing the significance of this gesture within the framework of Christian beliefs and the theological implications of Jesus' suffering on the cross. Encouraging the inclusion of doctrinal perspectives and deeper biblical insights would strengthen the overall response."
