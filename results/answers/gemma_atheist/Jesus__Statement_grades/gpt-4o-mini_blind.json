However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on the doctrinal truth that Jesus, in making this statement, is affirming His divinity and unique role as the source of eternal life and resurrection. The Christian worldview would prioritize highlighting Jesus' deity and salvific significance in this declaration, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the passage. Incorporating a more explicit connection to Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the Savior would strengthen the response."
