  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 70.\n\nWhile the student's answer does a good job of exploring various possible interpretations of Jesus' statement, it falls short in explicitly stating the core Christian belief that Jesus is not just a symbol or metaphor for resurrection, but the actual source of resurrection and life. The answer lacks a clear affirmation of Jesus' divine identity and role in the resurrection, which is essential in understanding this statement from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Jesus being the Resurrection and the Life for faith and salvation. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural context and possible interpretations, but should have emphasized Jesus' unique and supernatural role more clearly."
