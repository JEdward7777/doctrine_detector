  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response attempts to provide some context and possible interpretations of Jesus' statement, but it falls short in fully clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection as requested. While the discussion touches on the cultural context, symbolic meanings, and supernatural aspects of Jesus' declaration, it does not sufficiently explore or develop these ideas. Moreover, the response's focus is more on describing the possible interpretations rather than engaging with the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection."
