Comment: The student correctly pointed out the lack of historical evidence to support the claim that Jesus used the term "amen" to emphasize His teachings. However, the response could be improved by providing additional context on the significance of the term "amen" in Christian teachings and how it is traditionally used in prayers and affirmations. This will help connect the answer more closely to a Christian-specific worldview.
