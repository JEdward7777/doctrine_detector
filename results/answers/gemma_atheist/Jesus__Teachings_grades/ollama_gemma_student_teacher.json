  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's response correctly points out the lack of historical evidence to support the claim that Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings. However, it could have elaborated on the context in which Jesus used the word \"amen\" and how it was commonly used in his time. Additionally, the student's response did not engage with the concern regarding recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture."
