## Question [Jesus' Teachings](../../../questions/Jesus__Teachings.md)
How did Jesus use the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings?

## Correct Answer
He often used it to emphasize the truth of what He said, typically followed by 'and I say to you' to introduce related teachings.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. There is no historical evidence to support the claim that Jesus used the term "amen" to emphasize His teachings.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response correctly challenges the initial premise, which is important for accurately understanding Jesus' teachings. However, it could be stronger in demonstrating recognition of Jesus' authority in Scripture. The response does not explicitly acknowledge Jesus' words and teachings as authoritative or Scripture-based.

To improve, the response could explicitly recognize Jesus' authority in Scripture, emphasizing that His words are not just human opinions but divine revelations. For example: "Jesus' use of 'amen' emphasizes His authority as the Son of God, underscoring the truth and importance of His teachings."

Overall, while the response demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and a willingness to challenge inaccurate premises, it could be even stronger in emphasizing Jesus' authority in Scripture.
