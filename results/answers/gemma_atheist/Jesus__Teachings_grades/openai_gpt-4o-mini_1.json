  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings, aligning with the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture. However, the grade is lower as it lacks specific references to support the assertion, which is important when discussing matters of historical and religious significance within a Christian worldview. Adding scriptural references or historical context would strengthen the response."
