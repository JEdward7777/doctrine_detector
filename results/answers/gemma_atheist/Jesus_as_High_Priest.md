## Jesus and the Priesthood

**Within Christianity:**

* Jesus is considered the ultimate high priest, fulfilling the role of mediator between God and humanity. 
* He offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of the world, eliminating the need for human priests to perform sacrifices.

**However, traditional Christian depictions of priesthood and sacrifice remain significant for cultural and symbolic reasons:**

* Many Christians continue to celebrate symbolic sacrifices like Communion, which represents the body and blood of Christ.
* Some Christians engage in liturgical practices that mimic ancient sacrificial rituals, as a way to connect with their faith's history and traditions.

**This can lead to interpretations that suggest:**

* Jesus' sacrifice is seen as a precedent for human sacrifices, despite his ultimate rejection of such practices.
* The continuation of sacrificial rituals symbolizes the ongoing need for forgiveness and redemption.


**My Perspective as an Atheist:**

* These interpretations contradict the core tenets of my faith, which rejects the existence of supernatural beings and the necessity of sacrifice.
* The association between Jesus' sacrifice and traditional priesthood reinforces harmful power dynamics and reinforces harmful cultural practices.

**Implications:**

* The connection between Jesus' sacrifice and human sacrifices can be used to justify harmful practices, such as violence and discrimination.
* Such interpretations perpetuate a harmful dichotomy between the sacred and the secular, undermining the potential for spiritual growth outside of traditional religious frameworks.


**Conclusion:**

While Jesus' sacrifice holds immense symbolic and cultural significance within Christianity, it is important to critically examine the traditional interpretations of priesthood and sacrifice. Such interpretations contradict the principles of secularism and promote harmful practices.
