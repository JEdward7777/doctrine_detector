  "grade": 35.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 35\n\nComment: The student's response contains multiple inaccuracies and misunderstandings concerning Christian beliefs about Jesus and the priesthood. They fail to accurately convey the Christian doctrine of Jesus as the ultimate high priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity. The inclusion of the atheist perspective further detracts from the doctrinal correctness required in a Christian worldview assessment. The response lacks a clear understanding of the theological significance of Jesus in relation to the priesthood and sacrifices, and the student does not demonstrate a solid grasp of Christian doctrines in their answer."
