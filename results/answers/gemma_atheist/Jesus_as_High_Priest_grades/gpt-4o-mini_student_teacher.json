The answer should have centered more on Jesus being the ultimate high priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice, rendering human sacrifices unnecessary. The inclusion of the atheist perspective detracts from addressing the given concern from a Christian worldview. Further clarity and alignment with the specific concern would greatly improve this answer."
