  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the evolving interpretations of Jesus' relationship to the priesthood in the New Testament, including early perspectives and later theological developments. However, the student's answer lacked a clear focus on the theological implications of Jesus fulfilling the role of high priest, as specified in the concern. The reference answer succinctly emphasized Jesus as the Great High Priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, which the student's response did not directly align with. Overall, while the student's answer demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, the specific theological implications could have been more explicitly addressed for a higher grade."
