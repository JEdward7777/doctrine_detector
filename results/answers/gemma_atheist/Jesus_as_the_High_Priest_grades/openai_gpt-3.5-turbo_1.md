# Answer by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The New Testament presents a complex and evolving understanding of the relationship between Jesus and the priesthood. Early interpretations viewed Jesus as a high priest, but this perspective was later contested and redefined.

**Early Interpretations:**

* Some early theologians, like Barnabas and Papias, saw parallels between Jesus and the high priesthood. They interpreted Jesus' sacrifice as fulfilling the priestly role of offering atonement for sins.
* This perspective was widely accepted in early Christian communities, where Jesus was seen as the ultimate priest and mediator between God and humanity.

**Later Developments:**

* As Christianity developed, theological debates emerged regarding the need for an earthly priesthood. Some argued that Jesus' sacrifice rendered the traditional priesthood obsolete.
* Paul's letters specifically address the abolishment of the legal priesthood and the universality of believers as priests before God through Christ.
* This shift in perspective led to the emergence of a new understanding of priesthood as spiritual, focusing on the inherent holiness of all believers rather than the ordination of priests.

**New Testament Sources:**

* The New Testament presents varying interpretations of Jesus' priestly role. Some passages suggest a temporary priestly authority, while others emphasize his uniqueness as the ultimate sacrifice and mediator.
* The concept of priesthood is primarily associated with the Old Testament sacrificial system, which Jesus fulfills and transcends.

**Conclusion:**

The New Testament description of Jesus' relationship to the high priesthood is nuanced and evolving. Early interpretations saw Jesus as a high priest, but later theological developments emphasized the universality of believers as priests through Christ. The New Testament primarily focuses on Jesus' unique role as the ultimate sacrifice and mediator between God and humanity.
