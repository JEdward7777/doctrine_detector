  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the evolving understanding of Jesus' relationship to priesthood in the New Testament, considering early interpretations and later developments. The conclusion accurately summarizes the nuanced perspectives presented. The student effectively addresses the concern by exploring the theological implications of Jesus fulfilling the role of high priest within a Christian worldview. The response could have included more direct scriptural references to support the points made, which would have strengthened the analysis. Overall, a well-reasoned and insightful response."
