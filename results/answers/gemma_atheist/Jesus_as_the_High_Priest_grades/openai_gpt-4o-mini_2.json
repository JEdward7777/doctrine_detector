  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a well-structured and comprehensive analysis of the New Testament perspectives on Jesus fulfilling the role of high priest. It effectively references early interpretations, later developments, New Testament sources, and concludes with a clear summary of the evolving understanding. The inclusion of specific theologians, scriptural references, and theological debates adds depth to the discussion. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong grasp of the theological implications of Jesus as the Great High Priest in the New Testament. A slightly higher grade could be achieved by further emphasizing the continuity and fulfillment of the Old Testament sacrificial system by Jesus in the context of priesthood."
