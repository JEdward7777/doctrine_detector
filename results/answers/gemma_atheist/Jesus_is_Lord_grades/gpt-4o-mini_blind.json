However, the answer could be strengthened by explicitly highlighting the unique and exclusive lordship of Jesus in contrast to political leaders. Additionally, incorporating more direct references to biblical teachings on Jesus' lordship would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response. The tone of respect and cultural sensitivity is appropriate, but a firmer assertion of the supremacy of Jesus as Lord would be beneficial."
