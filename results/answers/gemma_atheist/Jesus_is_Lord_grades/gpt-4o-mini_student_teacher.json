  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has addressed the concern regarding the differentiation between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles by acknowledging the need for precision and clarity in communication. However, the student could have focused more directly on emphasizing the unique significance of Jesus' lordship and providing a clear explanation similar to the reference answer given by the teacher. Overall, the student has demonstrated an understanding of the importance of contextual awareness and cultural sensitivity in communicating theological concepts, but could have been more explicit in emphasizing the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles."
