It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The integration of precision, clarity, and inclusivity in language is commendable. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on the unique nature of Jesus' lordship and how it relates to traditional conceptions of earthly rulership. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful response."
