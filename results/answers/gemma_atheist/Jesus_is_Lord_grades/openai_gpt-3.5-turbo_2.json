  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the significance of \"Jesus is Lord\" in conveying Jesus' divine authority and distinction from human rulers. It provides clarity on differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The suggested guidelines for contextual awareness, precision, inclusive language, and cultural sensitivity offer valuable insights for addressing the concern raised. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly address how the term \"Lord\" may be perceived differently in various cultural and religious contexts. Overall, a strong and respectful Christian worldview approach is demonstrated in the response."
