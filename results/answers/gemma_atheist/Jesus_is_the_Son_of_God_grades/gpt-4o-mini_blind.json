  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and respectful approach to translating the phrase \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context. They have offered both a direct translation and contextual translations, emphasizing the differences in belief between Christianity and Islam. The student appropriately suggests focusing on shared beliefs and avoiding controversy. However, they could further enhance their answer by providing more explicit references to Islamic beliefs about Jesus as a prophet and how that contrasts with the Christian concept of Jesus being the Son of God. Overall, a solid response but could benefit from more depth in certain areas."
