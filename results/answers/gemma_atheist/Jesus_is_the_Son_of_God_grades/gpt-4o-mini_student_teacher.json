  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a good effort in providing multiple translation options while striving to minimize offense. The student appropriately emphasizes shared beliefs and suggests consulting Islamic scholars for accuracy. However, the answer could improve by directly maintaining the original terminology while providing clearer teaching and context, as recommended in the reference answer. Overall, a solid attempt with room for slight enhancement in aligning more closely with the Bible's intended meaning."
