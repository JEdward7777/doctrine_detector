It suggests maintaining the original terminology while providing clear teaching and context to explain the meaning, which aligns well with the concern of ensuring Biblical accuracy. The mention of incorporating shared beliefs and avoiding controversial language demonstrates a respectful and considerate attitude towards Muslim beliefs. The only room for improvement could be to provide more specific examples of how to explain the meaning of \"Son of God\" in a way that is both faithful to the Bible and respectful to Islamic beliefs."
