However, the statement that the Bible does not provide any instructions regarding how Christians should judge each other is inaccurate. The Bible does address the topic of judgment among believers, encouraging accountability, correction, and discipline within the community of faith. The response would benefit from a more balanced perspective on the issue of judgment as outlined in the biblical teachings."
