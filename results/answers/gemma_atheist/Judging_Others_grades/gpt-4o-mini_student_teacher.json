However, the student overlooks the fact that the Bible does provide instructions regarding how Christians should judge each other, as outlined in passages such as Luke 6:37. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into biblical teachings on judgment within the Christian community would enhance their understanding of this topic from a Christian worldview."
