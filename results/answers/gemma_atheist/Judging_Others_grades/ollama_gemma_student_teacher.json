  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's response accurately highlights the central theme of Christian teachings, which emphasizes compassion and forgiveness rather than judgment. However, it could benefit from a more explicit reference to the specific biblical passages that support the claim about avoiding harsh judgment. Including such references would strengthen the overall argument and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject matter."
