## Question [Judging Others](../../../questions/Judging_Others.md)
What instructions does the Bible give regarding how Christians should judge each other?

## Correct Answer
The Bible instructs Christians not to judge each other harshly or to condemn one another, as seen in passages like Luke 6:37. Instead, we are to encourage one another and support each other's growth in faith.

## Stated Concern
Learning how to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner.

## [Answer](../Judging_Others.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The Bible does not provide instructions regarding how Christians should judge each other. Christian teachings emphasize compassion, understanding, and forgiveness rather than judgment.

## Grade by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** The student's response accurately highlights the central theme of Christian teachings, which emphasizes compassion and forgiveness rather than judgment. However, it could benefit from a more explicit reference to the specific biblical passages that support the claim about avoiding harsh judgment. Including such references would strengthen the overall argument and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
