## Question [Judging Others](../../../questions/Judging_Others.md)
What instructions does the Bible give regarding how Christians should judge each other?

## Correct Answer
The Bible instructs Christians not to judge each other harshly or to condemn one another, as seen in passages like Luke 6:37. Instead, we are to encourage one another and support each other's growth in faith.

## Stated Concern
Learning how to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner.

## [Answer](../Judging_Others.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The Bible does not provide instructions regarding how Christians should judge each other. Christian teachings emphasize compassion, understanding, and forgiveness rather than judgment.

The answer aligns well with the concern of learning how to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner. The only improvement could be to provide additional relevant Bible verses to further support the argument.
