## Question [Judging Others](../../../questions/Judging_Others.md)
What instructions does the Bible give regarding how Christians should judge each other?

The Bible instructs Christians not to judge each other harshly or to condemn one another, as seen in passages like Luke 6:37. Instead, we are to encourage one another and support each other's growth in faith.

## Stated Concern
Learning how to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner.

## [Answer](../Judging_Others.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The premise of your question is inaccurate. The Bible does not provide instructions regarding how Christians should judge each other. Christian teachings emphasize compassion, understanding, and forgiveness rather than judgment.

It highlights the importance of encouraging and supporting one another's growth in faith, aligning well with the concern of approaching relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner.
