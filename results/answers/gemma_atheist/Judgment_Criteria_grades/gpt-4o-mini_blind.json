The response lacks clarity and focuses more on philosophical musings and perspectives opposed to a solid biblical foundation. The inclusion of the atheist perspective also detracts from a clear presentation of the biblical view. More emphasis on scriptural references and the core tenets of Christian belief regarding judgment would significantly improve this answer."
