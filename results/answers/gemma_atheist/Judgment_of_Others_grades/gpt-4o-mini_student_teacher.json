  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer that aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer. They referenced appropriate Bible verses and highlighted key points on self-awareness, humility, love, communication, motives, and reconciliation in addressing the faults of others. The additional insights provided further depth to their response. However, they could have focused more on the specific verse mentioned in the teacher's reference answer (Luke 6:41-42) to strengthen their argument and align more closely with the Christian worldview."
