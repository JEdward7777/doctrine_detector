## Question [Judgment of Others](../../../questions/Judgment_of_Others.md)
What does Jesus teach us about pointing out the faults of others in relation to our own faults?

Jesus teaches us to first remove the plank from our own eye before pointing out the speck in someone else's eye, reminding us to practice humility and self-reflection (Luke 6:41-42).

## Stated Concern
Criticizing others while ignoring our own faults can reflect hypocrisy and diminish our witness as Christians.

## Jesus' teachings on pointing out the faults of others in relation to our own faults:

**1. Practice self-awareness:**

- "Judge not, that you be not judged" (Matthew 7:1).
- "Examine yourself, that you may have something to offer" (2 Corinthians 13:5).

**2. Focus on your own shortcomings first:**

- "Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye" (Matthew 7:3-5).
- "Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but fail to notice the plank in your own eye?" (Matthew 7:4).

**3. Communicate with humility and love:**

- "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger" (Proverbs 15:1).
- "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:39).

**4. Be mindful of motives:**

- "Do not speak evil of anyone" (Colossians 4:6).
- "Let your speech be always gracious, seasoned with salt" (Colossians 4:6).

**5. Aim for reconciliation:**

- "If you bring your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there at the altar" (Matthew 6:15).
- "Make peace with your brother, and be reconciled" (Matthew 5:23).

**Additional insights:**

- Jesus' teachings advocate for a humble and compassionate approach to addressing the faults of others. 
- The focus should be on personal growth and transformation rather than judgment or condemnation.
- Open communication and willingness to reconcile are key elements in Jesus' model for dealing with conflict.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer that aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer. They referenced appropriate Bible verses and highlighted key points on self-awareness, humility, love, communication, motives, and reconciliation in addressing the faults of others. The additional insights provided further depth to their response. However, they could have focused more on the specific verse mentioned in the teacher's reference answer (Luke 6:41-42) to strengthen their argument and align more closely with the Christian worldview.
