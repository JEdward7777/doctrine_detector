  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out response showing consideration for both cultural sensitivity and theological accuracy. The suggested rephrasing options are creative and attempt to convey the essence of the Kingdom of God in a culturally relevant manner. However, it would have been beneficial if the student had explicitly mentioned the importance of consulting Scripture and theological doctrines to ensure that the essence of the Kingdom of God is not compromised in the rephrasing process. Overall, a solid effort with room for minor improvements."
