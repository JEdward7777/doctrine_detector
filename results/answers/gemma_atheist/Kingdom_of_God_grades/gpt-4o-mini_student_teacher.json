However, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes retaining 'Kingdom of God' to preserve its deep spiritual and eschatological significance. The student could improve their answer by addressing this concern more directly and emphasizing the importance of not losing the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God'."
