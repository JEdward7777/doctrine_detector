However, it does not fully address the concern, as rephrasing may indeed lead to a loss of depth and context. A more nuanced approach would be to provide explanations about the spiritual and eschatological significance of \"Kingdom of God\" alongside the rephrased options, thereby preserving the biblical context while still being sensitive to cultural differences."
