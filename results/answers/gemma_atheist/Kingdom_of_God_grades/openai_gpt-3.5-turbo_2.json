However, the proposed rephrasing options lack the direct connection to biblical terminology and may not fully capture its eschatological significance. While acknowledging the value of explanations to enhance understanding, more emphasis on retaining the original term and its spiritual implications would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
