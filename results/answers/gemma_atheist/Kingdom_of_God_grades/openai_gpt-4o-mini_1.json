  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned argument for retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' in translation, emphasizing the spiritual and eschatological significance while acknowledging the concern that rephrasing could potentially lose the deep biblical context. The suggestions for providing explanations to aid understanding are in line with maintaining theological integrity. The balancing of cultural sensitivity and theological accuracy is addressed effectively. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of preserving the biblical context while also being sensitive to cultural considerations."
