While it suggests retaining the original term and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance, it lacks a strong emphasis on the importance of preserving the theological accuracy in translations. Additionally, more specific references to Biblical passages or theological principles related to the Kingdom of God would strengthen the argument. Overall, a decent effort but could benefit from clearer theological insights and scriptural support."
