## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I acknowledge the cultural and symbolic significance of various religious concepts, including 'heaven' and 'kingdom.' However, I do not subscribe to the belief in supernatural entities or afterlife.

**From a cultural perspective:**

* The term 'heaven' resonates with cultural and linguistic traditions, providing a relatable framework for understanding the teachings.
* Its use evokes a sense of hope, aspiration, and transformation.
* It allows for a nuanced exploration of spiritual and ethical themes without making literal claims.

**From a literary perspective:**

* The pairing of 'kingdom' and 'heaven' in the book of Matthew creates a powerful symbolic contrast.
* The kingdom represents an earthly transformation, while heaven suggests a ultimate spiritual goal.
* This dichotomy highlights the interconnectedness of earthly actions and spiritual aspirations.

**From a non-religious perspective:**

* The concept of 'heaven' as a metaphor for a state of perfect peace, fulfillment, and liberation can inspire people regardless of their religious beliefs.
* It captures the human longing for transcendence, growth, and spiritual fulfillment.

**Therefore, retaining the term 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' adds depth and cultural sensitivity to the interpretation of the text, while remaining open to non-religious interpretations.**
