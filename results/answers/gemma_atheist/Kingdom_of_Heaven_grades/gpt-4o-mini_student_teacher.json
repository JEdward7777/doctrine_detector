  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 60/100.\n\nWhile the student provides a thoughtful analysis from various perspectives and acknowledges the cultural and symbolic significance of the term 'heaven,' they ultimately miss the Christian-specific theological implications related to retaining the term 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' in the book of Matthew. The student's focus on cultural, literary, and non-religious perspectives, while insightful, does not directly address the concern of understanding the intended messages of the biblical authors.\n\nThe student's answer would benefit from incorporating insights related to the theological implications and Christian worldview specifically emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
