  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a comprehensive and well-reasoned analysis of the importance of retaining 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven.' They demonstrate a deep understanding of the cultural, literary, and non-religious perspectives surrounding the term. The response is articulate and demonstrates critical thinking. However, it would benefit from a more explicit engagement with the Christian-specific worldview and its implications for the interpretation of the text."
