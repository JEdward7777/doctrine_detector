It also presents a nuanced analysis from different perspectives (cultural, literary, and non-religious), which demonstrates a comprehensive approach to grasping the intended message of the biblical author.\n\nThe response aligns well with the concern about understanding unique terminology used in the gospels. However, it could be improved by more explicitly connecting the cultural and symbolic significance of \"heaven\" to its theological implications regarding God's reign, as mentioned in the provided answer. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the context and offers thoughtful insights that can help readers appreciate the intended message of Matthew's gospel."
