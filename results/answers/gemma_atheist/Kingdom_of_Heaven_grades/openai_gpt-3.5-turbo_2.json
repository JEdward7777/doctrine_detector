  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and well-articulated analysis from an atheistic perspective, considering the cultural, literary, and non-religious implications of the term 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven.' While the response does not align with a Christian worldview due to the denial of supernatural entities and afterlife, it effectively addresses the concern by examining the significance of the unique terminology in Matthew's gospel. The response engages with the given answer while offering a comprehensive exploration of the topic."
