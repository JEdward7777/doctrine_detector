While their response did not align with a Christian worldview due to their atheistic beliefs, they made valid points regarding the cultural and metaphorical meanings associated with the term. However, they did not directly address the theological implications related to the use of 'heaven' in Matthew's gospel and its correlation to God's reign, which was the specific concern raised."
