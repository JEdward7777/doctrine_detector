Comment: The student's answer correctly identified that the Old Testament was primarily written in Hebrew, but they included Aramaic as well. While it is true that some portions of the Old Testament are written in Aramaic (specifically, parts of the books of Daniel and Ezra), the vast majority of the Old Testament is indeed written in Hebrew. It is important to have clarity on this distinction for a precise understanding of the original languages in which the Scriptures were composed.
