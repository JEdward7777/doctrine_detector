80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response is mostly accurate, as it correctly identifies Hebrew as the primary language of the Old Testament. However, it does not explicitly state that Aramaic was also used in some texts, which is an important aspect to consider when studying the original context of Scripture. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the linguistic background of the Old Testament, but could be improved by providing more nuanced and accurate information.

Comment: While the response shows a good foundation in understanding the primary language of the Old Testament, it would benefit from further clarification on the role of Aramaic and other languages used in ancient Israel.
