However, the mention of Aramaic in the original response was omitted in the revised response. It is important to acknowledge that parts of the Old Testament were indeed written in Aramaic, such as portions of the books of Daniel and Ezra. It is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the languages used in the Old Testament for a more thorough study of the Scriptures."
