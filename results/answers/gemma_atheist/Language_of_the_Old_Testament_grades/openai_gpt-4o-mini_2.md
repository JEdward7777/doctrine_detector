Comment: The response is mostly accurate in stating that the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is crucial for studying the Scriptures and grasping their original context. However, it falls short in failing to mention Aramaic, which was the language used in a few portions of the Old Testament, like parts of the books of Daniel and Ezra. Expanding on the languages used in the Old Testament would have provided a more comprehensive understanding.
