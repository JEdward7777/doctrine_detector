## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer does not directly address the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers. In a Christian worldview, fellowship and meeting together for prayer and scripture study are important aspects of believers' lives. The student's response lacks insight into the specific practices of believers meeting in someone's home, which are significant in nurturing faith and community among Christians. A more appropriate response would have acknowledged the importance of believers meeting together in fostering spiritual growth and encouragement.
