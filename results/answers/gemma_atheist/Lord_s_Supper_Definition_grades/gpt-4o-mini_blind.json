  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer accurately touches on the symbolic nature of the Lord's Supper and its significance in commemorating Jesus Christ's sacrifice and the new covenant. However, it falls short in emphasizing the historical and literal aspect of the Last Supper as recorded in the Bible. The Last Supper was indeed a historical event, not merely a symbolic representation. A stronger emphasis on the factual and historical context would improve the overall grade."
