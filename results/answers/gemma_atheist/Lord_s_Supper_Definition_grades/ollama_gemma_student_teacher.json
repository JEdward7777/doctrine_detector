  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer adequately explains the symbolic significance of the Lord's Supper as a representation of Christ's sacrifice and the establishment of a new covenant. However, it lacks specific reference to the Passover meal as the historical event commemorated by the ritual. Including this detail would strengthen the student's understanding of the Lord's Supper within the Christian faith."
