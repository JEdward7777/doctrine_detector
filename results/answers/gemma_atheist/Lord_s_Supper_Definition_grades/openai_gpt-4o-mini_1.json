It accurately depicts the event as a commemoration of the Passover meal where Jesus symbolized his body and blood as a sacrifice for sin. The only minor point of concern is that it could have included a bit more elaboration on the depth of the symbolism and the importance of partaking in the Lord's Supper with reverence and self-examination."
