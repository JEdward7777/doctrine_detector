## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The Lord's Supper commemorates the symbolic actions of Jesus Christ during the Last Supper, where he shared a meal with his disciples before his crucifixion. This ritualistic meal symbolizes Christ's sacrifice and the new covenant he establishes with his followers. 

While the event holds deep spiritual significance for believers, it does not commemorate a historical dinner in the literal sense. The Last Supper is primarily a symbolic representation of Christ's love, sacrifice, and the establishment of the Christian faith.
