  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns closely with the Christian perspective on the significance of the 'bond of marriage' and how couples should view their commitment to each other. The student effectively incorporated scriptural references and emphasized key principles such as covenant, sacrificial love, family foundation, fidelity, mutual submission, partnership, forgiveness, and reconciliation. The answer promotes strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships effectively."
