It effectively emphasizes the sacred covenant nature of marriage, the reflection of Christ's love, the foundation for family, and the importance of couple's commitment in fidelity, mutual submission, partnership, forgiveness, and reconciliation. It aligns well with promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships. Great job!"
