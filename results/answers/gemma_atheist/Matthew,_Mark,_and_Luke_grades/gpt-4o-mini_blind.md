## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The answer correctly points out that there is no specific book in the Bible that lists the names of the twelve disciples. However, it could have been strengthened by mentioning that the names of the twelve disciples can be found scattered across the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John).
