Grade: 50

Comment: While the student correctly identifies that the Bible does not list the names of the twelve disciples in every book, they missed the key aspect of the question, which was to be familiar with the Gospel accounts where these names are indeed listed. The answer lacks depth and understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic.
