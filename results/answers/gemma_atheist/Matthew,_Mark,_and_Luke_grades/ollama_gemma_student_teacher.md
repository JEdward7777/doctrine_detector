**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical text and accurately points out that the premise of the question is inaccurate. However, they could have elaborated further to acknowledge that while the Bible does not explicitly list the twelve disciples' names in one specific book, their names are indeed found in the Gospel accounts mentioned by the teacher's reference answer.
