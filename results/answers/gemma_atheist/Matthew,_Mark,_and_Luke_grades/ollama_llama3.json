  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThe respondent correctly identifies that the premise of the question is inaccurate, which shows understanding of the Gospel accounts. They also provide a clear and concise explanation of why the premise is incorrect. The only area for improvement is that they do not explicitly reference the correct books (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) in their response, instead stating that the names are listed \"in the books\" without specifying which ones.\n\nThe concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings is well-addressed, as the respondent demonstrates knowledge of the relevant scriptures. However, there is room for improvement in terms of clarity and specificity."
