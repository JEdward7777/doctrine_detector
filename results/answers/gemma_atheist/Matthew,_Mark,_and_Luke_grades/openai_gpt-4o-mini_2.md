Grade: 70

Comment: The response correctly identifies where the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the Bible, which demonstrates a good understanding of the Gospel accounts. However, the initial concern raised was about being familiar with the Gospel teachings, not just the accounts, so there is room for improvement in addressing the concern more directly by discussing the significance of the twelve disciples in the teachings of Jesus.
