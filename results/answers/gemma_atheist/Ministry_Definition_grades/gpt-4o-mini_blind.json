  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response lacks adherence to the specified Christian worldview. By dismissing the traditional understanding of 'ministering' in the Bible due to personal beliefs, the response fails to engage with the question from the perspective requested. In a Christian context, it is essential to approach biblical concepts with reverence and respect for the text's teachings, even if one does not personally adhere to them. Further engagement with the biblical understanding of ministering would have been more appropriate in this context."
