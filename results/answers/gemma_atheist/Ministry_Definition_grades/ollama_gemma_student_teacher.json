  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student demonstrates a thoughtful and analytical approach to the question, expressing reservations about traditional theological concepts of divine intervention and intermediaries. However, the response lacks clarity in its explanation of how the biblical concept of ministry aligns with the student's non-theistic perspective. The student could benefit from providing more direct engagement with the reference answer, explaining how their understanding of ministry differs from the traditional biblical perspective."
