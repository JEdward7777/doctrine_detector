  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response lacks alignment with the specified concern which emphasizes the importance of understanding the biblical definition of ministry for effective service. The rejection of a theistic framework does not acknowledge the significance that this framework holds for interpreting biblical concepts. In a Christian worldview, the validity of ministering and the role of divine intervention are foundational beliefs that shape the understanding and practice of ministry. This response does not effectively engage with the importance of biblical perspectives in ministry contexts."
