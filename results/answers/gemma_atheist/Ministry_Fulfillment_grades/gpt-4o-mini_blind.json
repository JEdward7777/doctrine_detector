The Christian perspective on ministry is deeply rooted in faith, Scripture, and the teachings of Jesus Christ. The answer should have addressed what it means to fulfill ministry specifically as a Christian, rather than offering a secular interpretation. Understanding and acknowledging the Christian worldview is crucial in providing a comprehensive response to this question."
