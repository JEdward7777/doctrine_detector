It dismisses the foundational Christian belief that ministry is a calling from God and focuses solely on secular and cultural interpretations. From a Christian perspective, fulfilling one's ministry goes beyond mere social service; it involves a spiritual commitment to God's purpose for one's life. This response lacks acknowledgment of the divine aspect of ministry, which is essential in a Christian worldview."
