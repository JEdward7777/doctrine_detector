  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The student's response dismisses the significance of miracles in leading to belief in God without considering the Christian perspective. From a Christian worldview, miracles are regarded as signs and wonders that testify to the power and existence of God. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and overlooks the importance of miracles in reinforcing faith in God as demonstrated throughout the Bible. The answer needs to align with Christian beliefs and acknowledge the role of miracles in pointing people towards belief in God, rather than solely focusing on scientific and cultural perspectives."
