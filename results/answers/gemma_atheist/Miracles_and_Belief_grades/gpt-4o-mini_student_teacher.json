  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the Christian perspective on miracles as signs of God's power. They fail to address the specific concern of how miracles lead to belief in God and instead focus solely on scientific, cultural, and logical perspectives that deny the supernatural. From a Christian worldview, miracles are seen as manifestations of God's presence and power, and the student's response does not align with this perspective."
