  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided presents a viewpoint that directly opposes a Christian specific worldview that believes in miracles as evidence of God's existence. While the argument is logically structured and presents scientific and psychological perspectives on miracles, it does not account for the Christian belief system where miracles are seen as manifestations of divine power. From a Christian worldview perspective, miracles are considered integral to validating faith and the ministry of prophets and apostles. In this context, the given response does not align with the concern of understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith, hence the low grade."
