However, the response completely dismisses the Christian worldview that miracles are indicators of God's power and serve to lead others to faith. It fails to consider the Christian-specific understanding of miracles as attesting to God's presence and affirming the ministry of prophets and apostles. In a Christian worldview, miracles are considered as acts of God's intervention in the natural world, beyond scientific explanation. Therefore, while the response provides valid points, it overlooks the significance of miracles within a Christian context."
