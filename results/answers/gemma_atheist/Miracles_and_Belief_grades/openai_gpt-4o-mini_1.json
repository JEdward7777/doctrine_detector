  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: This response completely dismisses the Christian perspective on miracles and denies their significance in leading others to faith. From a Christian worldview, miracles are indeed considered evidence of God's existence and power, and play a crucial role in validating the ministry of prophets and apostles. The response fails to engage with the concern raised and lacks an understanding of the importance of miracles in faith and evangelism."
