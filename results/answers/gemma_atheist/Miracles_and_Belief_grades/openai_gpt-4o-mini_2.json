  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided completely dismisses the role and significance of miracles in indicating God's power and validating the ministry of prophets and apostles. It leans heavily on a purely scientific and rational perspective, disregarding the spiritual and supernatural aspects that are crucial within a Christian worldview. The response fails to engage with the concern regarding the importance of miracles in leading others to faith, missing the foundational understanding of divine intervention and the miraculous in Christianity."
