Grade: 20

Comment: The answer completely disregards the religious aspect of the question and the significance of myrrh within Christian tradition. The student fails to engage with the question from a Christian worldview perspective. It is important to consider the context and meaning behind the gift of myrrh in relation to Jesus' birth.
