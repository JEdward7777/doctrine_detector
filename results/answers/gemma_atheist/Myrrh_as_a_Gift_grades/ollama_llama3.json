  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 20.\n\nThe response does not directly address the concern or relate to the answer provided, which is about understanding the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus. The respondent's statement about their limited knowledge base and inability to comment on historical existence also does not contribute to a deeper understanding of Jesus' purpose and mission.\n\nTo increase the grade, the respondent could have explicitly linked their knowledge limitations to the concern about understanding the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus, or provided an example from the Bible that illustrates how the symbolism of myrrh (or other gifts) relates to Jesus' purpose and mission. As it stands, the response does not demonstrate a meaningful connection between the concern and answer."
