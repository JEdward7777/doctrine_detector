However, the initial response avoiding commenting on the historical existence of Jesus due to a limitation to secular analysis does not fully engage with the Christian worldview, which emphasizes the importance of acknowledging Jesus as a central figure in history. Engaging with Jesus' historical existence from a Christian perspective would enhance the understanding of the symbolism of the gifts given to Him."
