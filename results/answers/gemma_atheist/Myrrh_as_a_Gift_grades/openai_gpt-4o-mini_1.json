The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the symbolism behind the gifts given to Jesus and how it relates to his purpose and mission. However, the initial response regarding the historical existence of Jesus Christ was inadequate as it failed to acknowledge the importance of Jesus' actual existence in understanding his significance. Encouraging the student to incorporate a Christian worldview in discussing historical aspects related to Jesus would have enhanced the overall response."
