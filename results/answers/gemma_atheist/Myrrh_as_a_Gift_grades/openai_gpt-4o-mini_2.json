  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-articulated explanation of the significance of myrrh in relation to Jesus' sacrificial role as the Messiah. However, the initial response that the historical existence of Jesus Christ cannot be commented on due to a limitation in the knowledge base raises a concern from a Christian worldview perspective. As a Christian, it is pivotal to understand and acknowledge the historical reality of Jesus Christ as a foundational aspect of faith. The response on the symbolism of myrrh is insightful, but the initial disclaimer regarding the historicity of Jesus impacts the overall grade."
