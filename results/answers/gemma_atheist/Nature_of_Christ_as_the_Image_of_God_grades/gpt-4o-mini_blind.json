  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45/100\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a decent overview of the concept of Jesus as the image of God, citing relevant biblical passages and common interpretations. However, the inclusion of the student's personal perspective, particularly denying the literal divinity of Jesus, significantly detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the response. In a Christian context, it is essential to uphold Jesus' divinity as a foundational belief, and any deviation from this doctrine would lower the grade significantly. The response lacks depth in explaining the profound theological implications of Jesus being the image of God in Christian belief. Additionally, it does not emphasize the unique and central role of Jesus in salvation and redemption, which are crucial aspects of understanding the significance of Jesus as the image of God."
