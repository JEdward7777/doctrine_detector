  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer diverges significantly from the Christian perspective by denying the literal divinity of Jesus. According to Christian belief, Jesus being the image of God signifies his divinity and role in salvation, which the student's response does not accurately reflect. Additionally, the student's answer lacks a clear theological understanding of the relationship between Jesus and God, focusing more on cultural influences and personal beliefs rather than the core Christian doctrine."
