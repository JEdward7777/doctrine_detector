  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of Jesus as the image of God from a Christian perspective, incorporating biblical references, cultural influences, common interpretations, significance, and a personal perspective. However, the response diverges from the specified concern by failing to emphasize Jesus' divine nature and instead takes a more metaphorical approach. While the content is well-written and informative, it lacks alignment with the explicitly stated theological focus on Christ's divinity."
