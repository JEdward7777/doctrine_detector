  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the concept of Jesus as the image of God from a biblical perspective, discussing various interpretations and the significance of this belief in Christian theology. However, the student's personal perspective, while acknowledging the impact of Jesus, diverges from traditional Christian belief in the divinity of Christ. This departure from Christian orthodoxy affects the overall grade."
