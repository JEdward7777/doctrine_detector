The discussion on common interpretations and significance, while insightful, lacks a direct alignment with the concern regarding the theological understanding of Christ's nature in relation to God. The personal perspective diverges from the Christian belief in the divinity of Jesus, which impacts the overall coherence with a Christian-specific worldview."
