  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of principles and strategies for approaching exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament. However, the core reference answer from the teacher emphasizes exhorting in love, which is a fundamental principle that seems to be missing from the student's detailed response. While the student's points are valid and relevant, they could have been improved by explicitly highlighting the importance of exhortation being delivered in a loving and supportive manner, as per the concern provided."
