Each point addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of love, sensitivity, authenticity, respect, and continuous growth in exhortation practices. The suggestions align well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the principles of the New Testament and the authority of Scripture. The only minor area for improvement could be further emphasizing the importance of prayer and reliance on the Holy Spirit in the exhortation process. Overall, a solid and well-rounded response."
