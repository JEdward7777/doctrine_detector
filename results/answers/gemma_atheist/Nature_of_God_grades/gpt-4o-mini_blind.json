  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive exploration of the concept of God as spirit and its implications for worship. The student demonstrates an understanding of the theological implications and ethical considerations related to this statement. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the distinct Christian understanding of God as spirit and the exclusive nature of Christian worship through Jesus Christ. Incorporating more explicit references to Christian doctrine and the unique role of Jesus as the mediator between God and humanity would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
