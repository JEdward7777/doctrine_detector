The writer correctly identifies that God's spirituality transcends physical form, suggesting that worship should be focused on spiritual engagement rather than physical rituals. The response also shows awareness of the importance of cultural sensitivity in interpreting biblical texts and acknowledges the need to respect diverse spiritual perspectives.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more specific examples or illustrations to support its points. Additionally, some of the language is quite general and does not add significant depth or nuance to the discussion. However, overall, this is a strong and thoughtful response that demonstrates a good grasp of the concern.\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and concise explanation of Jesus' statement \"God is a spirit\" and its implications for worship.
