  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student demonstrates an attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of biblical perspectives on hell from a cultural and critical standpoint. However, as the question specifically asked for the biblical perspective without the filter of atheistic or cultural lenses, the student's response falls short in providing a doctrinally accurate portrayal of what the Bible says about the nature and experience of hell. There is a noticeable lack of reference to the authority of Scripture and a tendency to secularize or rationalize biblical teachings on this topic. The response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on biblical passages and traditional Christian interpretations of hell."
