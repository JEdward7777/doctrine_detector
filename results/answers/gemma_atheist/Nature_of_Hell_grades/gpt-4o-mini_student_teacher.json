  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-written and insightful, falls short from a Christian perspective as it lacks the fundamental belief that hell is a real place of eternal punishment for those who reject God. The student's focus on cultural interpretations and symbolic language detracts from the central Christian teaching on hell as a place of unending suffering. A Christian viewpoint would emphasize the seriousness of hell as a just consequence for sin and rejection of God's salvation through Jesus Christ."
