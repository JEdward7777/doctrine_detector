  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the response attempts to provide a nuanced examination of biblical interpretations of hell and acknowledges cultural influences, it falls short in addressing the Christian-specific concern of the severity and purpose of hell in relation to judgment and salvation. The response focuses more on symbolic and metaphorical interpretations rather than the traditional Christian understanding of hell as a place of eternal punishment for those who reject God. A stronger emphasis on the significance of hell in the Christian view of judgment and salvation would have improved the grade for this response."
