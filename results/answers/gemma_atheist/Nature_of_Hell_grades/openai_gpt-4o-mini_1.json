The response could have emphasized the significance of hell as a consequence for rejecting God's offer of salvation through Jesus Christ, highlighting the ultimate separation from God as the ultimate punishment. Additionally, the ethical implications could have been critiqued within a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of justice and righteousness in understanding the concept of hell."
