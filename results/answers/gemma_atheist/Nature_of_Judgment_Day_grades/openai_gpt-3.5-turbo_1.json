The student's refusal to engage with religious concepts limits the opportunity for a meaningful discussion within a Christian worldview perspective. Encouragement to seek out Christian sources for more accurate information is appropriate, but a basic understanding and acknowledgment of the significance of Judgment Day within Christian belief would have been beneficial in addressing the concern."
