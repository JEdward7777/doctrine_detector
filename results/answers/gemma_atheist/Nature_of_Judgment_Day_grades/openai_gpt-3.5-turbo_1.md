Comment: The response provided lacks depth and understanding of the Christian concept of Judgment Day and its implications for personal faith. The student's refusal to engage with religious concepts limits the opportunity for a meaningful discussion within a Christian worldview perspective. Encouragement to seek out Christian sources for more accurate information is appropriate, but a basic understanding and acknowledgment of the significance of Judgment Day within Christian belief would have been beneficial in addressing the concern.
