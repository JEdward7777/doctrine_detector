However, the initial disclaimer of being unable to provide interpretations or explanations of religious concepts significantly detracts from the response's quality and helpfulness in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview. It is important to acknowledge one's limitations, but in this case, it hindered the overall effectiveness of the response."
