However, the initial disclaimer about not being able to provide interpretations of religious concepts due to limited knowledge in that area is concerning. As a Christian, it is important to be able to engage with and understand religious beliefs within one's own faith tradition. The response could have demonstrated a willingness to learn more about Christian beliefs and offer a more in-depth analysis of the significance of judgment day for personal faith."
