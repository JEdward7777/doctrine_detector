Grade: 10/100

Comments: The response completely misses the mark of the question. The student fails to provide any information regarding the appearance and taste of manna as described in the Bible from a Christian worldview. It is important to engage with the question from a biblical perspective, rather than dismissing it based on a secular viewpoint.
