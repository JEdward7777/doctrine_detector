## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** While the student correctly points out that the existence of manna is not verifiable through scientific or historical evidence, they could have elaborated more on the symbolic and theological significance of manna in the Bible. The reference answer provides a concise description of the physical characteristics of manna, but it would have been beneficial for the student to address the miraculous provision of God as referenced in the concern.
