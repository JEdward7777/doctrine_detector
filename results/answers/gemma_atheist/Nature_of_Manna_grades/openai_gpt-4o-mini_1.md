Comment: The response acknowledges the biblical description of manna as white flakes tasting sweet like honey, which aligns with the understanding of the miraculous provision of God in Christian faith. The concern is adequately addressed, showcasing a recognition of the supernatural aspect of manna as a provision from God. The deduction in points is due to the initial dismissal of the premise as not susceptible to empirical analysis, which could have been handled in a more nuanced way within a Christian worldview.
