  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: The student's answer completely dismisses the Christian worldview and foundational beliefs. The student fails to engage with the question from a Christian perspective, which holds that Jesus' miracles do indeed reveal His identity as the Son of God. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and ignores the significance of miracles in confirming Jesus' divine nature as understood within Christianity."
