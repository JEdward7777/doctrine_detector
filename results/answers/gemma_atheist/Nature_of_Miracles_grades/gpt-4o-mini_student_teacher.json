  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 20.\n\nWhile the student provides a well-reasoned argument from a secular perspective, the answer deviates significantly from the Christian worldview. As the concern specifically relates to the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature, the student completely dismisses the foundational belief held by Christians that Jesus' miracles do indeed point to His identity as the Son of God.\n\nThe student argues against the reliability of the miracles based on scientific scrutiny, cognitive biases, and alternative explanations, failing to engage with the Christian understanding of miracles as expressions of divine power and purpose. From a Christian worldview, miracles are seen as signs pointing to the supernatural, rather than purely natural or psychological phenomena.\n\nIn light of the divergence from the Christian perspective on the significance of Jesus's miracles, the low grade reflects the lack of alignment with the specified concern."
