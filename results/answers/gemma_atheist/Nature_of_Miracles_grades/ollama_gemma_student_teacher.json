They acknowledge the cultural and historical context of the accounts, consider scientific scrutiny, and explore alternative explanations. However, the overall tone of the answer leans towards skepticism, questioning the reliability of the miracles as evidence for Jesus' identity. While this approach is commendable, it ultimately departs from the teacher's reference answer, which emphasizes the miracles as proof of Jesus' divinity."
