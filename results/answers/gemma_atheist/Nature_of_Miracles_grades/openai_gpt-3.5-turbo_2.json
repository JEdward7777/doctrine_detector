  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided a well-structured and detailed analysis from a secular perspective, highlighting various concerns about the reliability and interpretation of Jesus' miracles. However, it completely disregarded the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature, which is a crucial aspect from a Christian worldview. It failed to engage with the question posed and the significance of miracles as a foundation for affirming Jesus's identity as God incarnate. The response did not address the concern provided with a Christian-specific perspective, resulting in a low grade."
