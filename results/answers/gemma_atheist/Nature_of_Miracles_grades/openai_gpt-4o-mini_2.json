However, the response does not consider or engage with the Christian worldview that asserts Jesus' miracles as evidence of His divine nature and identity as the Messiah. To truly evaluate the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature from a Christian perspective, one must approach the topic with an understanding and acceptance of the foundational beliefs of Christianity."
