The mention of various literary genres and human authorship, without highlighting the ultimate authority of God as the primary author of Scripture, may lead to a misunderstanding of the Bible's nature and purpose. A stronger emphasis on the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding the authors and preserving the integrity of God's Word would have strengthened the theological perspective in the response."
