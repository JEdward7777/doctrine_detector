  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of scripture and the Word of God in the biblical context, addressing the various literary genres and interpretations involved. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the specific relationship between written scripture (Old Testament) and God's spoken word (including messages from Jesus), as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, incorporating more direct biblical references or theological perspectives would strengthen the student's argument from a Christian worldview."
