40.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student correctly acknowledges the absence of information in the provided text regarding sinful nature and external influences in temptation. However, a better response could have been provided by explaining the Christian perspective on these concepts in relation to temptation, even if not directly mentioned in the text. This response lacks depth and application of a Christian worldview.
