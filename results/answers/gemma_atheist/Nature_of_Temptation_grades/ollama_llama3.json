  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThis response partially addresses the concern by acknowledging that there are external influences (other people and Satan) that can entice us to sin, which is in line with Christian teaching. However, it does not fully address the concern because it only briefly touches on the concept of external influences without providing more depth or explanation. Additionally, it does not mention the sinful nature as a driving force for desire, which is an important aspect of Christian teaching.\n\nThe response also fails to engage directly with the provided text, which could have been used to support or illustrate the concepts being discussed. A higher grade would require a more thorough engagement with the concern and the provided text, providing more depth and explanation regarding the sources and reasons for temptation in Christian teaching."
