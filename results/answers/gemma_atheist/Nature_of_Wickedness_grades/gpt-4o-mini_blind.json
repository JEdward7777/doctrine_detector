The references to specific biblical passages are appropriate and supportive of the points made. However, to enhance the answer, further elaboration on the transformative power of repentance and forgiveness through Jesus Christ could have been included. Additionally, expounding on God's mercy and grace even towards the wicked, as demonstrated in scriptures like Romans 5:8, would provide a more balanced perspective on the topic."
