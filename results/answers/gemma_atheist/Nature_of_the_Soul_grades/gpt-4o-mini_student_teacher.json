  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the distinctions between soul and spirit in the Bible, referencing relevant biblical passages and cultural considerations. However, the reference answer from the teacher indicates that the Bible may present these concepts as either distinct or interchangeable, which the student did not address. This oversight slightly affects the accuracy of the response. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic, but attention to the possibility of interchangeable use in biblical contexts would have improved the answer."
