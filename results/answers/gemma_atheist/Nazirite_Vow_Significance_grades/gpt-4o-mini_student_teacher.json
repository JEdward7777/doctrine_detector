  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the student acknowledges the historical and religious significance of the Nazirite vow, their answer does not directly address the specific restrictions outlined in Numbers 6:1-4. It is important to provide a clear and direct response to the question being asked, while also taking into consideration the biblical context and significance. The student's answer falls short in this regard."
