  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response does a good job of accurately summarizing the key restrictions of the Nazirite vow as outlined in Numbers 6:1-4. It demonstrates an understanding of the purpose and significance of the vow within its biblical context. The deduction in points is due to the initial disclaimer that suggests a reluctance to engage with potentially controversial topics, even when addressing them from a biblical perspective. Overall, a strong response with appropriate biblical knowledge and understanding."
