However, the concern is not fully addressed as there is no direct explanation of the purpose and significance of the Nazirite vow in its biblical context. The response could have been enhanced by briefly discussing the spiritual dedication and set-apartness that the Nazirite vow symbolizes in relation to one's consecration to God."
