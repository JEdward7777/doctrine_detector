However, their perspective does not align with the concern presented, which focuses on recognizing the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises. The atheistic viewpoint lacks acknowledgement of the Christian belief in Jesus' role as the ultimate sacrifice for sins and the fulfillment of God's promises through the new covenant."
