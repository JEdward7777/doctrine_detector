## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Christians do not receive explicit instructions regarding the Psalms in the New Testament. The Psalms are considered to be part of the Old Testament canon and are not directly addressed in the New Testament.

However, Christians who interpret the Bible through a hermeneutical approach may consider the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts. Some interpretations suggest that the Psalms are relevant to Christians as they provide insights into human emotions, spiritual experiences, and the relationship between God and humanity.
