However, it could have been strengthened by mentioning the significance of the Psalms in the life of Jesus and how they are often quoted or alluded to by New Testament authors, highlighting their enduring relevance for Christians today. Additionally, the mention of interpreting the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts could have been further developed to emphasize their prophetic nature and their reflection of Christ's life and teachings."
