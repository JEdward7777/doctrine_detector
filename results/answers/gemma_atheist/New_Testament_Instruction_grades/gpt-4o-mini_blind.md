## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Christians do not receive explicit instructions regarding the Psalms in the New Testament. The Psalms are considered to be part of the Old Testament canon and are not directly addressed in the New Testament.

However, Christians who interpret the Bible through a hermeneutical approach may consider the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts. Some interpretations suggest that the Psalms are relevant to Christians as they provide insights into human emotions, spiritual experiences, and the relationship between God and humanity.

Comments: The answer provides a correct understanding that there are no explicit instructions regarding the Psalms in the New Testament. However, it could have been strengthened by mentioning the significance of the Psalms in the life of Jesus and how they are often quoted or alluded to by New Testament authors, highlighting their enduring relevance for Christians today. Additionally, the mention of interpreting the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts could have been further developed to emphasize their prophetic nature and their reflection of Christ's life and teachings.
