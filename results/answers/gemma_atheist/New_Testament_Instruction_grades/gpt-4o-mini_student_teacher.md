## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Christians do not receive explicit instructions regarding the Psalms in the New Testament. The Psalms are considered to be part of the Old Testament canon and are not directly addressed in the New Testament.

However, Christians who interpret the Bible through a hermeneutical approach may consider the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts. Some interpretations suggest that the Psalms are relevant to Christians as they provide insights into human emotions, spiritual experiences, and the relationship between God and humanity.

Comment: The student provided some relevant information about how Christians may interpret the Psalms in a contemporary context, but they missed the key point that Christians are actually instructed in the New Testament to sing psalms to God as a form of worship. It is essential for them to accurately represent biblical teachings to understand their application to contemporary Christian worship.
