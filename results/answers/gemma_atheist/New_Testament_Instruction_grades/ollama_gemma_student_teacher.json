However, it lacks clarity in addressing the specific concern regarding the application of Psalms in contemporary Christian worship. The response correctly points out that the Psalms are not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament but suggests their potential relevance based on theological and literary interpretations. However, it does not elaborate on how Christians can practically incorporate the Psalms into their contemporary worship practices."
