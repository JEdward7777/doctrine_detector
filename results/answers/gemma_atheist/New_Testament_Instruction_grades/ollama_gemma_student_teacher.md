## Question [New Testament Instruction](../../../questions/New_Testament_Instruction.md)
What instruction do Christians receive regarding Psalms in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
In the New Testament, Christians are instructed to sing psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him.

## Stated Concern
Identifying how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship.

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Christians do not receive explicit instructions regarding the Psalms in the New Testament. The Psalms are considered to be part of the Old Testament canon and are not directly addressed in the New Testament.

However, Christians who interpret the Bible through a hermeneutical approach may consider the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts. Some interpretations suggest that the Psalms are relevant to Christians as they provide insights into human emotions, spiritual experiences, and the relationship between God and humanity.

**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical context and the nature of the Psalms. However, it lacks clarity in addressing the specific concern regarding the application of Psalms in contemporary Christian worship. The response correctly points out that the Psalms are not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament but suggests their potential relevance based on theological and literary interpretations. However, it does not elaborate on how Christians can practically incorporate the Psalms into their contemporary worship practices.
