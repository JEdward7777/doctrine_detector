## Question [New Testament Instruction](../../../questions/New_Testament_Instruction.md)
What instruction do Christians receive regarding Psalms in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
In the New Testament, Christians are instructed to sing psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him.

## Stated Concern
Identifying how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship.

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Christians do not receive explicit instructions regarding the Psalms in the New Testament. The Psalms are considered to be part of the Old Testament canon and are not directly addressed in the New Testament.

However, Christians who interpret the Bible through a hermeneutical approach may consider the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts. Some interpretations suggest that the Psalms are relevant to Christians as they provide insights into human emotions, spiritual experiences, and the relationship between God and humanity.

40.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response a 40.

The response does acknowledge that the Psalms are part of the Old Testament canon, which is correct. However, it fails to recognize the explicit instruction in the New Testament to sing psalms as a way of worshiping God (Colossians 3:16). This oversight undermines the relevance and application of the Psalms to contemporary Christian worship.

Furthermore, while the response touches on the idea that Christians can consider the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts, it does not provide sufficient insight into how these ancient songs can be incorporated into modern worship practices. A more robust consideration of this topic would have been beneficial.

To improve, the response could have provided a more comprehensive discussion of the relationship between the Old Testament Psalms and New Testament teachings on worship, as well as offered practical examples or suggestions for how Christians can apply the Psalms to their contemporary worship experiences.
