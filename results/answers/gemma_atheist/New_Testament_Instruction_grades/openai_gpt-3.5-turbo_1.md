## Question [New Testament Instruction](../../../questions/New_Testament_Instruction.md)
What instruction do Christians receive regarding Psalms in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
In the New Testament, Christians are instructed to sing psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him.

## Stated Concern
Identifying how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship.

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Christians do not receive explicit instructions regarding the Psalms in the New Testament. The Psalms are considered to be part of the Old Testament canon and are not directly addressed in the New Testament.

However, Christians who interpret the Bible through a hermeneutical approach may consider the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts. Some interpretations suggest that the Psalms are relevant to Christians as they provide insights into human emotions, spiritual experiences, and the relationship between God and humanity.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response correctly acknowledges that Christians are instructed to sing psalms to God in the New Testament for worship, which is relevant to contemporary Christian worship. However, it does not fully address the concern of how this biblical teaching applies to worship today. A stronger response would have provided more depth and insight into how the Psalms can influence and enrich contemporary Christian worship practices and deepen the believer's relationship with God.
