## Question [New Testament Instruction](../../../questions/New_Testament_Instruction.md)
What instruction do Christians receive regarding Psalms in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
In the New Testament, Christians are instructed to sing psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him.

## Stated Concern
Identifying how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship.

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Christians do not receive explicit instructions regarding the Psalms in the New Testament. The Psalms are considered to be part of the Old Testament canon and are not directly addressed in the New Testament.

However, Christians who interpret the Bible through a hermeneutical approach may consider the Psalms in their theological and literary contexts. Some interpretations suggest that the Psalms are relevant to Christians as they provide insights into human emotions, spiritual experiences, and the relationship between God and humanity.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response acknowledges the instruction in the New Testament to sing psalms to God as a form of worship, which is relevant to contemporary Christian worship practices. However, it could have provided more direct application of this biblical teaching to how Christians can specifically incorporate the Psalms into worship today. Additional scriptural references or examples of how Psalms are utilized in modern Christian worship would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective.
