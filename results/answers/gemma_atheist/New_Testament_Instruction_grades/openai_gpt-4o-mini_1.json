However, the concern raised about how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship was not fully addressed in the response. While the response mentioned the relevance of the Psalms in theological and literary contexts, it could have further explored how Christians today can incorporate the Psalms into their worship practices to deepen their relationship with God and express their emotions in a way that honors Him."
