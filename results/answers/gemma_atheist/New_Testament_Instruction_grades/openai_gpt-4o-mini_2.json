The concern of applying biblical teachings to contemporary Christian worship is partially addressed by highlighting the instruction to sing Psalms to God in the New Testament. However, there could be further elaboration on how this practice can be practically implemented in modern worship settings, which would enhance the response and align more closely with the concern provided."
