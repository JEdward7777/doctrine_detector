  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-rounded explanation on the concept of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament. They correctly highlighted the biblical perspective on universal priesthood, ministry, service, and the absence of a formal priestly ordination in the New Testament. The inclusion of cultural considerations added depth to the answer. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the unique role of Christ as the High Priest in relation to believers being priests, emphasizing the doctrine of the priesthood of Christ. Overall, a solid and informative response."
