## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The assertion that every believer in Jesus is considered a priest in the New Testament is not accurate.**

While the New Testament emphasizes the priesthood of all believers, it does not literally mean that every individual becomes a priest in the traditional sense. The concept of priesthood in the New Testament refers to the spiritual responsibility of all believers to participate in God's work through their faith and actions.

**Biblical Perspective:**

* **Universal Priesthood:**
    * The New Testament teaches that all believers are priests because they have been made "royal priests" (1 Peter 2:9) and "a royal priesthood" (Revelation 1:6).
    * This means that every believer has the privilege of approaching God directly through Christ (Hebrews 4:16).

* **Ministry and Service:**
    * The priesthood involves serving others and participating in God's work.
    * The New Testament encourages believers to use their gifts and talents to serve the church and the wider community (1 Corinthians 12:4-5).

* **Formal Priesthood:**
    * The New Testament does not establish a formal priestly ordination or hierarchy.
    * The concept of ordination is primarily associated with the early church and is not explicitly commanded in the New Testament.

**Cultural Considerations:**

* **Cultural Influences:**
    * The understanding and practice of priesthood can vary widely across cultures and religions.
    * Some cultures may have different interpretations or traditions regarding priesthood.

* **Inclusivity and Empowerment:**
    * Promoting the idea that every believer is a priest can empower individuals and foster a sense of inclusivity.
    * It emphasizes that every follower of Jesus has a valuable role to play in God's kingdom.

**Conclusion:**

While the New Testament emphasizes the spiritual priesthood of all believers, it does not suggest that every individual becomes a formal priest in the traditional sense. The concept of priesthood involves spiritual responsibility, ministry, and service, rather than a hierarchical ordination system.

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-rounded explanation on the concept of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament. They correctly highlighted the biblical perspective on universal priesthood, ministry, service, and the absence of a formal priestly ordination in the New Testament. The inclusion of cultural considerations added depth to the answer. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the unique role of Christ as the High Priest in relation to believers being priests, emphasizing the doctrine of the priesthood of Christ. Overall, a solid and informative response.
