  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers from a biblical perspective and considers cultural influences and implications, they ultimately come to the conclusion that every individual does not become a formal priest in the traditional sense. The student's explanation aligns closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, demonstrating a good understanding of the concept. However, deducting some points for not directly matching the reference answer in stating that every believer in Jesus is considered a priest who can come directly to God in prayer to intercede for themselves and others. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid comprehension of the concept despite falling slightly short of replicating the specific wording of the reference answer."
