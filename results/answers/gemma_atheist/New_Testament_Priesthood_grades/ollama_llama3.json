  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of the priesthood of all believers, emphasizing its spiritual significance and implications for Christian life. It correctly notes that this concept does not imply formal ordination or hierarchy, but rather emphasizes the responsibility of every believer to participate in God's work and serve others. However, it could be improved by providing more explicit connections between the biblical passages cited and the concept of priesthood. Additionally, the cultural considerations section seems somewhat disconnected from the main theme and could be integrated more smoothly into the overall discussion.\n\nThe graded response addresses the concern \"Understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers\" well, but could benefit from further development to achieve a perfect score."
