  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response offers a comprehensive and well-supported analysis of the concept of the priesthood of all believers from a biblical perspective. It effectively addresses the concern by providing scriptural references and explanations while also acknowledging cultural influences and considerations. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept and provides a nuanced explanation of how every believer is considered a priest in the spiritual sense rather than in a formal hierarchical sense."
