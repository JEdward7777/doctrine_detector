  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers from a Christian perspective. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying that while all believers are considered priests in the spiritual sense, it does not equate to a formal priesthood as traditionally understood. The biblical references and cultural considerations enhance the response's depth and perspective, making it insightful and well-rounded."
