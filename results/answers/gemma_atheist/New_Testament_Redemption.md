## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
## Changes in the Concept of Purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament:

**Old Testament:**

* Focused on physical purification rituals, sacrifices, and purity laws. 
* Emphasis on separating the "clean" from the "unclean," often based on dietary restrictions and contact with certain individuals or objects.
* Belief that purity was essential for approaching God and receiving his blessing.
* Purity was primarily associated with the restoration of Israel as a nation.

**New Testament:**

* Emphasis shifted from physical purification to spiritual purification.
* Focus on the internal transformation of individuals through faith in Jesus Christ.
* Emphasis on forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God through Christ's sacrifice.
* Purity is now associated with living a life that aligns with Christ's teachings and reflecting his righteousness.


**Key differences:**

* **Source of Purity:** Old Testament - external rituals & practices; New Testament - internal transformation through faith.
* **Focus:** Old Testament - physical purity; New Testament - spiritual purity.
* **Purpose:** Old Testament - achieve earthly blessing; New Testament - achieve eternal life.


**Possible interpretations of this shift:**

* **Christ as the ultimate purification:** Jesus' sacrifice removes the stain of sin and allows for reconciliation with God.
* **Internal transformation:** Faith in Christ leads to a change of heart and life.
* **Emphasis on love:** The New Testament prioritizes love for God and others as the ultimate expression of purity.


**Implications of this shift:**

* Liberation from the burden of legalistic purity rituals.
* Focus on the universality of salvation, available to all regardless of cultural or physical background.
* Emphasis on the transformative power of faith in Christ, leading to a life of greater purpose and meaning.
