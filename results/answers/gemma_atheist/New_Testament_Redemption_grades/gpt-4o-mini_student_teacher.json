  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive comparison of the concept of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament, highlighting key differences in source, focus, and purpose. They correctly point out the shift from external rituals to internal transformation through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the student's answer lacks emphasis on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification, which is the specific concern outlined in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to explicitly tie in the significance of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of purification would enhance the response."
