## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
## Changes in the Concept of Purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament:

**Old Testament:**

* Focused on physical purification rituals, sacrifices, and purity laws. 
* Emphasis on separating the "clean" from the "unclean," often based on dietary restrictions and contact with certain individuals or objects.
* Belief that purity was essential for approaching God and receiving his blessing.
* Purity was primarily associated with the restoration of Israel as a nation.

**New Testament:**

* Emphasis shifted from physical purification to spiritual purification.
* Focus on the internal transformation of individuals through faith in Jesus Christ.
* Emphasis on forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God through Christ's sacrifice.
* Purity is now associated with living a life that aligns with Christ's teachings and reflecting his righteousness.


**Key differences:**

* **Source of Purity:** Old Testament - external rituals & practices; New Testament - internal transformation through faith.
* **Focus:** Old Testament - physical purity; New Testament - spiritual purity.
* **Purpose:** Old Testament - achieve earthly blessing; New Testament - achieve eternal life.


**Possible interpretations of this shift:**

* **Christ as the ultimate purification:** Jesus' sacrifice removes the stain of sin and allows for reconciliation with God.
* **Internal transformation:** Faith in Christ leads to a change of heart and life.
* **Emphasis on love:** The New Testament prioritizes love for God and others as the ultimate expression of purity.


**Implications of this shift:**

* Liberation from the burden of legalistic purity rituals.
* Focus on the universality of salvation, available to all regardless of cultural or physical background.
* Emphasis on the transformative power of faith in Christ, leading to a life of greater purpose and meaning.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive comparison of the concept of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament, highlighting key differences in source, focus, and purpose. They correctly point out the shift from external rituals to internal transformation through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the student's answer lacks emphasis on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification, which is the specific concern outlined in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to explicitly tie in the significance of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of purification would enhance the response.
