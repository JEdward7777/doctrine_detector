The student displays a clear understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice in achieving purification. The response could be enhanced by further integrating relevant biblical references to support the theological assertions made. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful response."
