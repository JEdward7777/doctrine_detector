  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student correctly pointed out that there is no explicit mention of John the Baptist being a Nazirite in the New Testament. However, they failed to consider the angel's announcement to Zechariah, which does suggest that John may have been under the Nazirite vow. The student's response shows some knowledge but lacks a holistic understanding of connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures."
