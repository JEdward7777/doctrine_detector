75.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 75

**Comment:** The student correctly points out that the premise of the question is inaccurate, as there is no explicit evidence in the New Testament to support the claim that John the Baptist was a Nazirite. However, the teacher's reference answer suggests that the angel's announcement to Zechariah implies that John was under the Nazirite vow, which connects the practice of the Nazirite vow in the Old Testament with John the Baptist's life in the New Testament.
