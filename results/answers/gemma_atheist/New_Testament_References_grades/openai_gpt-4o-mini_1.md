85.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The response is well-supported with contextual evidence from the angel's announcement to Zechariah. However, it could have been strengthened by further discussing the significance of connecting Old Testament practices, such as the Nazirite vow, with New Testament figures like John the Baptist to demonstrate biblical continuity.
