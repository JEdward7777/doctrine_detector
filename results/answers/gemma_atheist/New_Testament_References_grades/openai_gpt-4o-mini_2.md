Grade: 80

Comment: The response provided a valid argument connecting John the Baptist's abstinence from strong drink with the Nazirite vow, which suggests a continuity between Old Testament practices and New Testament figures. However, it could have been strengthened by referencing other relevant passages to support this claim.
