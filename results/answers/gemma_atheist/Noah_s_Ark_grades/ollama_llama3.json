  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that the Bible describes events from a spiritual perspective, which shows some understanding of the concern to understand God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative of Noah's Ark. However, the response's inability to provide an answer based on the premise of the question, due to viewing biblical accounts as non-historical, may not fully address the concern.\n\nThe score of 60 reflects that while the response shows some awareness of the importance of spiritual perspective in understanding biblical events, it does not directly engage with the specific concern about God's plan for salvation and preservation through Noah's Ark. To receive a higher grade, the response would need to demonstrate a more explicit connection between the story of Noah's Ark and God's plan for salvation and preservation."
