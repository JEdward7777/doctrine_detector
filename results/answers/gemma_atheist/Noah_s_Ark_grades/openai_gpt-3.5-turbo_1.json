The concern regarding understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative of Noah's Ark is adequately addressed through the explanation given. However, the initial response that the Bible is not to be understood as historical facts in the modern sense lacks depth and nuance in representing the Christian view of Scripture."
