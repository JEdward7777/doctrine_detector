  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response fails to acknowledge the Christian perspective on wisdom and listening to God. From a Christian worldview, wisdom is ultimately rooted in fearing the Lord and following His commandments (Proverbs 9:10). Additionally, listening to God through prayer, scripture, and meditation is integral to gaining wisdom (James 1:5). The student presented a comprehensive analysis from an atheistic and traditional perspective, but their explanation lacks depth from a Christian viewpoint. It is important for the student to consider and incorporate the foundational principles of Christian faith when exploring this topic to provide a more well-rounded and accurate understanding."
