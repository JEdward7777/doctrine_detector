  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive exploration of the topic from differing perspectives, but the answer lacks alignment with the Christian worldview. The atheistic perspective dominates the explanation, with minimal acknowledgment of the Christian worldview that recognizes God as the source of wisdom. The emphasis on cultural and psychological factors overlooks the spiritual aspect of wisdom based on listening to God. In a Christian context, wisdom is inseparable from a relationship with God and obedience to His will, which is not adequately addressed in the response."
