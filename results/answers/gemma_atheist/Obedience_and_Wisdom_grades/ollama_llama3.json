  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThis response does acknowledge the connection between obedience to God and wisdom, which aligns with the concern. However, it also provides a nuanced view by highlighting the limitations of relying solely on listening to God for wisdom. The response recognizes that true wisdom involves critical thinking, analysis, and a willingness to challenge assumptions, which is an important consideration.\n\nWhile the response may not fully affirm the original statement about becoming wise through listening to God, it does provide a thoughtful and balanced perspective. The grade reflects this balance, recognizing both the connection between obedience and wisdom as well as the need for intellectual inquiry and critical thinking.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the concern, acknowledging the link between obedience and wisdom while also emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and intellectual inquiry. While it may not fully align with the original statement, it provides a nuanced and balanced perspective that is worth considering."
