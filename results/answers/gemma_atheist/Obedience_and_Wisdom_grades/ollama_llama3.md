## [Answer](../Obedience_and_Wisdom.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**From an atheistic scholar's perspective:**

While listening to God may hold significance for those who believe in his existence, it does not align with my understanding of wisdom as a scholar who rejects the existence of supernatural entities.

**Traditional perspectives suggest:**

* Wisdom is the result of critical reflection, experience, and intellectual inquiry.
* It involves understanding and analyzing information, drawing inferences, and making informed decisions.
* True wisdom transcends cultural or religious beliefs.

**Connecting the concepts of listening to God and becoming wise:**

* **Psychological and emotional connection:** Listening to religious texts or teachings can provide comfort, inspiration, and a sense of purpose. This emotional engagement can influence behavior and foster personal growth.
* **Moral guidance:** Religious teachings often contain ethical principles and moral values. By listening to God, individuals may learn certain ethical frameworks and moral boundaries.
* **Cultural transmission:** Religious practices and beliefs are often deeply embedded in cultural contexts. Listening to God can provide insights into the cultural values and traditions associated with a particular religion.

**However, it's important to note:**

* These connections are cultural and psychological, not based on empirical evidence or logical reasoning.
* True wisdom involves critical thinking, analysis, and a willingness to challenge assumptions.

**Conclusion:**

Listening to God may have cultural and psychological benefits, but it does not constitute a basis for becoming wise in the traditional sense. Wisdom is primarily attained through human intellectual endeavors, based on reason, evidence, and critical reflection.
