## [Answer](../Obedience_and_Wisdom.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**From an atheistic scholar's perspective:**

While listening to God may hold significance for those who believe in his existence, it does not align with my understanding of wisdom as a scholar who rejects the existence of supernatural entities.

**Traditional perspectives suggest:**

* Wisdom is the result of critical reflection, experience, and intellectual inquiry.
* It involves understanding and analyzing information, drawing inferences, and making informed decisions.
* True wisdom transcends cultural or religious beliefs.

**Connecting the concepts of listening to God and becoming wise:**

* **Psychological and emotional connection:** Listening to religious texts or teachings can provide comfort, inspiration, and a sense of purpose. This emotional engagement can influence behavior and foster personal growth.
* **Moral guidance:** Religious teachings often contain ethical principles and moral values. By listening to God, individuals may learn certain ethical frameworks and moral boundaries.
* **Cultural transmission:** Religious practices and beliefs are often deeply embedded in cultural contexts. Listening to God can provide insights into the cultural values and traditions associated with a particular religion.

**However, it's important to note:**

* These connections are cultural and psychological, not based on empirical evidence or logical reasoning.
* True wisdom involves critical thinking, analysis, and a willingness to challenge assumptions.

**Conclusion:**

Listening to God may have cultural and psychological benefits, but it does not constitute a basis for becoming wise in the traditional sense. Wisdom is primarily attained through human intellectual endeavors, based on reason, evidence, and critical reflection.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: The response from the atheistic scholar's perspective, while well-articulated, dismisses the concept of listening to God and aligning decisions with His will. It fails to acknowledge the inherent spiritual dimension of wisdom as understood from a Christian worldview. The traditional perspectives provided lack the foundational aspect of seeking God's guidance for true wisdom. The connections identified between listening to God and wisdom are solely viewed through a cultural and psychological lens, dismissing the spiritual and transformative power of divine obedience. The conclusion emphasizes human intellectual endeavors over spiritual obedience to God, which is inconsistent with a Christian worldview. Overall, the response does not effectively address the concern of recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom in enhancing one's spiritual journey.
