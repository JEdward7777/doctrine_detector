  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how the priests in the Old Testament carried out their ministry in the temple. The answer includes key points such as ritual purity, sacrificial system, temple rituals, instruction and guidance, mediation and reconciliation, as well as cultural considerations. The response is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. Consideration of the theological significance and spiritual aspects tied to the priestly ministry could further enrich the response from a Christian worldview perspective. Great effort overall."
