  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive understanding of how the priests in the Old Testament carried out their ministry in the temple. However, the answer tends to focus more on the intricate details and cultural considerations surrounding the priests' practices rather than specifically emphasizing their primary roles of offering sacrifices, taking care of the temple, and praying on behalf of the people. While the student showcases a solid understanding of the practices, the answer could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the core functions of the priests' ministry as outlined in the reference answer."
