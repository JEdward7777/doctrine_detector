  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nThe student's answer is somewhat general and does not provide specific details about the priests' ministry in the Old Testament, as presented in the original text. While they mention some of the key aspects of priestly ministry, such as offering sacrifices and praying on behalf of the people, their description lacks depth and nuance.\n\nIn particular, the student's answer does not engage with the concern of recognizing how Old Testament practices can inform current ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service. The original text highlights the importance of understanding these cultural considerations, but the student's response does not demonstrate an awareness of this relevance.\n\nTo improve their response, the student could provide more specific examples from the text about the priests' ritual purity, sacrificial system, temple rituals, instruction and guidance, and mediation and reconciliation. They could also explore how these practices might inform current ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service, rather than simply listing general characteristics of priestly ministry."
