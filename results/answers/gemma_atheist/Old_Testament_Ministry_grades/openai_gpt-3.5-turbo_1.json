However, the response could be improved by incorporating more specific details from the original answer, such as the importance of ritual purity, temple rituals, and mediation and reconciliation in the priestly ministry. By doing so, the response would better reflect how understanding the practices of the Old Testament priests can inform current ministry approaches and sacrificial service within a Christian worldview."
