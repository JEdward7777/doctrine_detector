However, it could have been strengthened by incorporating more specific details from the provided information, particularly regarding the priests' role in maintaining ritual purity, conducting temple rituals, providing guidance, and mediating reconciliation. Connecting these practices to inform current ministry approaches could have further enhanced the response."
