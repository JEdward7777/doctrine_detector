## Difference between Old and New Testament Understanding of Atonement:

**Old Testament:**

* Emphasizes animal sacrifices and rituals as atonement for sin. 
* Focuses on external actions and offerings to appease God's wrath. 
* Represents atonement as restoration of relationship with God through ritual purity. 
* Implicitly linked to the concept of sacrifice as foreshadowing Jesus' sacrifice in the New Testament.

**New Testament:**

* Highlights Jesus Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and perfect atonement for sin. 
* Emphasis on Christ's sacrifice as an act of love and redemption, not as payment or bribe. 
* Focuses on the transformation of the heart through faith in Jesus, rather than external actions. 
* Represents atonement as reconciliation with God through a personal relationship with Christ.


**Key Differences:**

* **Underlying Philosophy:** The Old Testament approach is influenced by the ancient Hebrew belief in a transactional relationship with God, where sacrifices were seen as restoring balance. The New Testament emphasizes God's unconditional love and grace in redemption.
* **Focus:** The Old Testament emphasizes external actions, while the New Testament emphasizes internal transformation through faith.
* **Nature of Atonement:** The Old Testament approach involves animal sacrifices, while the New Testament focuses on Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and perfect atonement.


**Implications:**

* Understanding the differing concepts of atonement can lead to better interpretation of both testaments.
* Applying the New Testament understanding of atonement to the Old Testament context can lead to confusion and misinterpretation. 
* Recognizing the continuity and discontinuity between the two testaments allows for a richer understanding of God's redemptive plan throughout history.
