  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: \nThe student has provided a generally accurate and comprehensive comparison between the Old and New Testament understandings of atonement. The distinctions in underlying philosophy, focus, and nature of atonement are well articulated. However, the answer could benefit from a deeper exploration of key doctrinal differences, such as the satisfaction theory of atonement in the New Testament and how it differs from the sacrificial system in the Old Testament. Additionally, a more explicit connection to specific biblical passages or theological concepts would enhance the answer's depth and clarity."
