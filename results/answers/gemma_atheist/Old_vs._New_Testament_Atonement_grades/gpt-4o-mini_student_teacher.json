  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provides a detailed comparison between the Old and New Testament understandings of atonement, highlighting key differences in philosophy, focus, and nature of atonement. They also discuss the implications of understanding these differences. \n\nHowever, the student's answer lacks a direct focus on the transition from temporary to permanent atonement as specified in the concern. They touch upon the nature of atonement in both testaments but do not explicitly address how the concept evolved from temporary sacrifices in the Old Testament to the permanent sacrifice of Christ in the New Testament. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic but could improve by directly addressing the specified concern."
