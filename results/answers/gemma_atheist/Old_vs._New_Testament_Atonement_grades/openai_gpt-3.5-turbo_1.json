The analysis provided in the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the differences between the Old and New Testament perspectives on atonement from a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps provide a bit more explanation on how this transition from temporary to permanent atonement reflects the progression of God's redemptive plan throughout biblical history."
