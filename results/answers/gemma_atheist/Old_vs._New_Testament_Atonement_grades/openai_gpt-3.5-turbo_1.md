# Answer by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
## Difference between Old and New Testament Understanding of Atonement:

**Old Testament:**

* Emphasizes animal sacrifices and rituals as atonement for sin. 
* Focuses on external actions and offerings to appease God's wrath. 
* Represents atonement as restoration of relationship with God through ritual purity. 
* Implicitly linked to the concept of sacrifice as foreshadowing Jesus' sacrifice in the New Testament.

**New Testament:**

* Highlights Jesus Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and perfect atonement for sin. 
* Emphasis on Christ's sacrifice as an act of love and redemption, not as payment or bribe. 
* Focuses on the transformation of the heart through faith in Jesus, rather than external actions. 
* Represents atonement as reconciliation with God through a personal relationship with Christ.


**Key Differences:**

* **Underlying Philosophy:** The Old Testament approach is influenced by the ancient Hebrew belief in a transactional relationship with God, where sacrifices were seen as restoring balance. The New Testament emphasizes God's unconditional love and grace in redemption.
* **Focus:** The Old Testament emphasizes external actions, while the New Testament emphasizes internal transformation through faith.
* **Nature of Atonement:** The Old Testament approach involves animal sacrifices, while the New Testament focuses on Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and perfect atonement.


**Implications:**

* Understanding the differing concepts of atonement can lead to better interpretation of both testaments.
* Applying the New Testament understanding of atonement to the Old Testament context can lead to confusion and misinterpretation. 
* Recognizing the continuity and discontinuity between the two testaments allows for a richer understanding of God's redemptive plan throughout history.

Comment: This response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the transition from temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament to Christ's single sacrifice in the New Testament for permanent atonement. The analysis provided in the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the differences between the Old and New Testament perspectives on atonement from a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps provide a bit more explanation on how this transition from temporary to permanent atonement reflects the progression of God's redemptive plan throughout biblical history.
