The explanation is well-supported with relevant details and demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian perspective on atonement. However, the response could further elaborate on how this transition reflects God's redemptive plan and the significance of Christ's sacrifice in fulfilling the temporary sacrifices of the Old Testament."
