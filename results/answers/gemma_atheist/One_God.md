**1. Context-Sensitive Translation:**

* Understand the cultural and religious beliefs of the target audience.
* Consult religious scholars and theologians from diverse perspectives.
* Consider the symbolic and cultural significance of the concept of "one God" in different cultures.


**2. Emphasize Similarity rather than Exclusivity:**

* Highlight the universal principles of monotheism: monolatry (worship of one deity) and exclusivity of devotion.
* Emphasize the similarities between the monotheistic belief in "one God" and other polytheistic traditions that acknowledge multiple deities as powerful entities.


**3. Use Inclusive Language:**

* Avoid language that suggests exclusivity or superiority of one religion over others.
* Use neutral and inclusive terms that respect the diverse beliefs of the audience.


**4. Focus on Shared Beliefs:**

* Emphasize the shared human experience of seeking a higher power or ultimate reality.
* Highlight the common ground between monotheistic and polytheistic beliefs in concepts such as creation, morality, and transcendence.


**5. Provide Contextual Explanations:**

* Offer background information on the concept of monotheism and its historical development.
* Explain the theological debates and interpretations surrounding the concept of "one God" within Christianity.


**6. Seek Compromise and Respect:**

* "The singular and ultimate source of power and creation."
