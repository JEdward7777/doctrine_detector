However, there is a concern that the response may not adequately address cultural polytheism or considerations for an inclusive approach that respects diverse beliefs. Incorporating elements from the suggested response, such as using inclusive language, emphasizing shared beliefs, and seeking compromise and respect, would have further enhanced the overall effectiveness of addressing the concern."
