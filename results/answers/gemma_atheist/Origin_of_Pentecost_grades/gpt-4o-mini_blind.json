  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive overview of the historical and religious significance of the Festival of Weeks before the events described in the New Testament. The student effectively explains the origins, religious significance, cultural importance, and significance for early Christianity. The inclusion of details such as sacrificial practices, communal meals, and religious instruction enriches the answer. From a Christian perspective, the transition of the Festival of Weeks into the celebration of Pentecost in early Christianity is well articulated. Good job overall, with minor room for further elaboration on the connection between the Old Testament symbolism and its fulfillment in Christ."
