It effectively connects the Jewish celebration of Pentecost with its fulfillment in Christ by highlighting the early Christians' adoption of the festival and the theological implications of Pentecost in Christianity. The response maintains a strong Christian worldview by acknowledging the continuity and transformation of religious practices from the Old Testament to the New Testament."
