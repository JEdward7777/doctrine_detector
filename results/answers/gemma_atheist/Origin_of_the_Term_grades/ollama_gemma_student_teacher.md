## Question [Origin of the Term](../../../questions/Origin_of_the_Term.md)
Where were Jesus' followers first called 'Christians'?

## Correct Answer
Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in the city of Antioch.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing historical context and significance of the term 'Christian'.

## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The earliest reference to Christians as a collective appears in non-canonical writings around 100 AD, several decades after Jesus' death and resurrection. The term likely emerged as a way to describe the followers of Jesus within the Roman Empire, and its usage was likely influenced by the existing political and cultural landscape.

The first known instances of the term "Christian" in historical records come from non-Christian sources such as the Roman historian Tacitus and the Jewish historian Josephus. These early references suggest that the term was used to describe the followers of Jesus as a distinct group with a unique identity.
