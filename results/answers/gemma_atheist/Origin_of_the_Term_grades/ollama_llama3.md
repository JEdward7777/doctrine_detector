## Question [Origin of the Term](../../../questions/Origin_of_the_Term.md)
Where were Jesus' followers first called 'Christians'?

## Correct Answer
Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in the city of Antioch.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing historical context and significance of the term 'Christian'.

## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The earliest reference to Christians as a collective appears in non-canonical writings around 100 AD, several decades after Jesus' death and resurrection. The term likely emerged as a way to describe the followers of Jesus within the Roman Empire, and its usage was likely influenced by the existing political and cultural landscape.

The first known instances of the term "Christian" in historical records come from non-Christian sources such as the Roman historian Tacitus and the Jewish historian Josephus. These early references suggest that the term was used to describe the followers of Jesus as a distinct group with a unique identity.

Comment: The response provides some accurate information about the early use of the term "Christian", but it lacks recognition of the historical context and significance of the term in its discussion. While it mentions that the term emerged several decades after Jesus' death and resurrection, it does not delve deeper into the cultural and political factors that influenced its usage. Additionally, the response does not explicitly acknowledge the significance of the term "Christian" as a distinct identifier for followers of Jesus within the Roman Empire. Overall, while the response touches on some key points, it could be improved by providing more nuance and context to its discussion.

The main issue with this response is that it does not fully address the concern of recognizing the historical context and significance of the term "Christian". The correct answer mentions Antioch specifically, which is a important piece of information that is not addressed in the provided response.
