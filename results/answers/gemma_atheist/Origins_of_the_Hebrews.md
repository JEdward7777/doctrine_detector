## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The biblical account of the Hebrews' ancestry is a religious and cultural construct that lacks historical verification.** Many scholars argue that the traditional biblical narratives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are cultural myths rather than historical facts.

**From a secular perspective:**

* The archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the ancient Hebrews were a diverse group of people who shared common cultural and linguistic traits.
* Their origins likely predate the biblical narratives and are not fully understood.
* Many scholars believe that the concept of "the Hebrews" as a distinct and unified people did not exist until much later in history.

**Therefore, there is no definitive answer to the question of who the Hebrews descended from in the Bible, from an atheistic or secular perspective.**
