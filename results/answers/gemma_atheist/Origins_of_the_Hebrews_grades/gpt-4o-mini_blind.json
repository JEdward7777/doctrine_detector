From a Christian perspective, the Bible is considered the inspired Word of God, and the accounts of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are foundational to the faith. The answer should acknowledge the biblical narrative and explore how it aligns or differs with historical and archaeological evidence, rather than outright dismissing it as a religious construct lacking historical verification. The response could benefit from a more balanced approach that considers both secular and Christian perspectives."
