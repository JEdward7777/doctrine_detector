## Question [Origins of the Hebrews](../../../questions/Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md)
Who are the Hebrews descended from in the Bible?

## Correct Answer
The Hebrews are descended from Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the heritage of the Hebrew people is important for grasping Biblical narratives.

## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The biblical account of the Hebrews' ancestry is a religious and cultural construct that lacks historical verification.** Many scholars argue that the traditional biblical narratives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are cultural myths rather than historical facts.

**From a secular perspective:**

* The archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the ancient Hebrews were a diverse group of people who shared common cultural and linguistic traits.
* Their origins likely predate the biblical narratives and are not fully understood.
* Many scholars believe that the concept of "the Hebrews" as a distinct and unified people did not exist until much later in history.

**Therefore, there is no definitive answer to the question of who the Hebrews descended from in the Bible, from an atheistic or secular perspective.**

Grade: 20

Comment: The response completely dismisses the biblical account of the Hebrews' ancestry as a cultural construct without historical verification, which ignores the Christian perspective that views the Bible as the inspired word of God. While it's valid to consider archaeological and genetic evidence, the answer fails to engage with the importance of understanding the Hebrew people's heritage in grasping Biblical narratives from a Christian worldview. The response also completely overlooks the significance of the lineage from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob in Christian theology.
