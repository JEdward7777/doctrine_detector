  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student attempts to engage with the concept of pardon in a secular and cultural context, which is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview, the rejection of the premise of a supernatural being forgiving sin through sacrifice conflicts with fundamental Christian beliefs. The emphasis on forgiveness as a social construct and cultural construct disregards the core theological significance of God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ. The response lacks a clear understanding and representation of Christian doctrine in discussing the concept of pardon in relation to God's forgiveness of sin."
