  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student fails to engage with the Christian worldview presented in the reference answer. Their perspective as an atheist scholar and focus on secular and cultural views do not address the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness as understood through Jesus Christ in Christianity. The answer dismisses the religious belief without providing a Christian perspective or demonstrating an understanding of the topic from within that framework."
