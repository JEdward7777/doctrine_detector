The focus on secular, atheist, and cultural perspectives detracts from examining the concept within a Christian framework. It dismisses the religious understanding of pardon and divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ, missing the opportunity to delve into the theological implications of this relationship. A more in-depth analysis rooted in Christian beliefs would have been more appropriate for this question."
