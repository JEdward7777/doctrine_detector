  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation on how the celebration of Passover signifies Jesus' fulfillment of ancient prophecies and his role as the ultimate Passover offering. They effectively connect the Old Testament Passover to the New Testament revelation of Jesus. However, the student includes some unnecessary information like the variations in how Christians celebrate Passover and potential scholarly disagreements. The response could have been improved by focusing more on the specific connection between Jesus and the Passover lamb, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding is demonstrated, but a more focused and concise approach would have enhanced the clarity and relevance of the response."
