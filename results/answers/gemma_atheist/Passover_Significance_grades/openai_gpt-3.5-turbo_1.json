The response effectively addresses the concern by presenting how Jesus is not only seen as the Passover Lamb but also how His sacrifice fulfills ancient prophecies and provides redemption from sin and death. The connections drawn between Jesus and the Passover lamb are supported by relevant biblical references and theological explanations. The response acknowledges differing Christian practices related to Passover and raises valid scholarly perspectives, showing a well-rounded understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
