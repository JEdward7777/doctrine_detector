It is crucial to recognize the contextual significance of the stoning of Paul in Lystra and draw out lessons on perseverance in faith and ministry, while also acknowledging the broader theological principles at play in scripture. Encouraging the exploration of these themes through a doctrinally sound lens would have enriched the response."
