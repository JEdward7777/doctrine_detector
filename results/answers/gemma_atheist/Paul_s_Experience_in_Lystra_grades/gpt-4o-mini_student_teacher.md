Comment: While it is important to recognize and condemn harm and violence, the student's response missed the opportunity to focus on the underlying message of perseverance and faith in difficult circumstances that can be drawn from the stoning of Paul in Lystra. Encouraging perseverance and faith in the face of adversity is a key aspect of the Christian worldview, and the student's answer did not address this essential element.
