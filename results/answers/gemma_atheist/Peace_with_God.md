## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**Faith in Jesus' sacrifice does not play a role in achieving peace with God according to scripture.**

The core teachings of Christianity emphasize belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and his sacrifice as the means of salvation. However, this concept is not consistent with the principles of atheism, which rejects the existence of supernatural beings and the need for redemption through sacrifice.

The scriptures that Christians interpret as evidence of Jesus' sacrifice and redemption are open to various interpretations and do not provide definitive proof of his divinity or the need for salvation through his sacrifice.

**Peace with God is achieved through understanding and accepting the principles of humanism and reason.** This involves:

* Recognizing the interconnectedness of all things
* Embracing empathy and compassion
* Practicing ethical behaviors
* Engaging in meaningful relationships
* Finding fulfillment in intellectual and artistic pursuits

**Therefore, faith in Jesus' sacrifice is not necessary or sufficient for achieving peace with God according to scripture or human experience.**
