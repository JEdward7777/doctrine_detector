  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The answer provided shows a fundamental misunderstanding of Christian doctrine. Faith in Jesus' sacrifice is central to achieving peace with God according to Scripture as taught throughout the New Testament. The response's promotion of humanism and reason as the means to achieving peace with God contradicts Christian beliefs. The student's answer lacks doctrinal correctness and misrepresents Christian teachings, earning a low grade."
