  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response strays significantly from the Christian perspective outlined in the reference answer. Faith in Jesus' sacrifice is foundational in Christian belief for achieving peace with God, and the student's assertion that it is not necessary or sufficient is not aligned with core Christian teachings. Additionally, the discussion on humanism and reason as the means to achieving peace with God does not address the specific Christian worldview inherent in the question. A deeper understanding of Christian theology and scripture is needed for a higher grade."
