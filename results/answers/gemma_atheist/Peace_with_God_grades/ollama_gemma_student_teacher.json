While the student presents well-reasoned arguments against the traditional understanding of salvation through sacrifice, their approach lacks engagement with the specified concern, which focuses on the significance of faith in the Life of a Christian. The response relies on secular humanist and rationalist principles to achieve peace with God, completely disregarding the Christian perspective."
