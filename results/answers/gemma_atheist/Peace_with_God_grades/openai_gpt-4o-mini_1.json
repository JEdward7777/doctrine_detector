It fails to address the concern regarding the significance of faith in the life of a Christian, and instead promotes a humanistic perspective that contradicts essential Christian teachings. In a Christian worldview, faith in Jesus' sacrifice is foundational to salvation, reconciliation with God, and living a life aligned with God's will."
