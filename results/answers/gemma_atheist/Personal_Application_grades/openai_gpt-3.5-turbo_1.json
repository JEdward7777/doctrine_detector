However, the majority of the response focuses on cultural influences and alternative perspectives rather than directly addressing the concern of personal implications in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. It would have been stronger if the response had delved deeper into how purification from sin impacts the individual's relationship with God and their commitment to living a holy life according to Christian teachings."
