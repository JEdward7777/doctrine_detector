However, the majority of the response focuses on alternative perspectives and cultural influences, with minimal exploration of the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living from a Christian worldview. More emphasis on the Christian perspective and its significance in personal spiritual transformation would have been beneficial."
