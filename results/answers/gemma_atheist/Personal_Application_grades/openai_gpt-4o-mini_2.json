While it acknowledges cultural influences, it does not sufficiently address the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living from a Christian worldview. The response should focus more on aligning the alternative perspectives discussed with the central Christian belief of repentance, forgiveness through Jesus' sacrifice, and the call to live a holy life."
