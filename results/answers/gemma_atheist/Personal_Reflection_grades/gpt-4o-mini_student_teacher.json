  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized explanation of how the expression \"woe is me\" relates to awareness of suffering or sin, covering aspects such as distress, self-inflicted torment, self-awareness, humility, and cultural significance. The response effectively addresses the concern of encouraging personal reflection on one's own spiritual state and awareness of sin. However, the student could have tied these points back more explicitly to a Christian worldview perspective, emphasizing the need for repentance, redemption, and reliance on God's forgiveness in the face of suffering and sin."
