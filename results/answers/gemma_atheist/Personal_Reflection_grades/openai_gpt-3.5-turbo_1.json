The inclusion of variations in meaning and contextual considerations further enriches the analysis. The discussion encourages personal reflection on one's spiritual state and awareness of sin by highlighting the implications of the expression within a Christian worldview. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern and provides insightful insights. Great work!"
