It effectively connects the expression to acknowledging personal suffering or sin and highlights the significance of self-inflicted torment, self-awareness, humility, and desperation. The response also provides insight into the cultural and contextual aspects of the phrase, enriching the understanding from a Christian worldview perspective."
