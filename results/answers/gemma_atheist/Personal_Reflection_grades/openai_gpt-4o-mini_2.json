The connection to personal reflection on one's spiritual state and awareness of sin is well-established throughout the explanation. The additional insights on variations in meaning and contextual considerations further enhance the understanding of the expression. This response effectively promotes deep reflection from a Christian worldview on the implications of personal suffering and sin."
