It effectively highlights the points of conflict, misunderstandings, division, and Jesus' criticisms and confrontations. The inclusion of early Christian responses and the influence on Christian thought is also commendable. To improve, the response could strengthen the connection to a Christian worldview by emphasizing the theological implications of the Pharisees' legalism and contrasting it with the teachings of Jesus from a doctrinal perspective."
