It effectively addressed the concern by highlighting the specific points of conflict, misunderstandings, division, Jesus' criticism and confrontation, early Christian responses, and influence on Christian thought. The analysis aligns well with the concern and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the role of the Pharisees in shaping the challenges faced by Jesus in his ministry from a Christian worldview."
