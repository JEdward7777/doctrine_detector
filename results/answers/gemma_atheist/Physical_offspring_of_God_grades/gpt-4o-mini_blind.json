It effectively emphasizes the symbolic and metaphorical nature of the concept while acknowledging diverse interpretations. The inclusion of cultural sensitivity and seeking diverse perspectives further enhances the response. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly referencing biblical passages or doctrines that support the interpretation of \"Son of God\" as symbolic rather than literal. Overall, a good effort with room for a bit more doctrinal grounding in biblical theology."
