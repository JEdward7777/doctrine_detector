  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive approach to clarifying the term \"Son of God\" for someone who believes it implies physical offspring of God. However, the answer lacks a direct emphasis on the Christian-specific interpretation that 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God. This foundational teaching is crucial in preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology within a Christian worldview. The answer could be significantly improved by incorporating this key theological point into the response."
