  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response correctly emphasizes that \"Son of God\" refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, which addresses the concern about proper teaching and retaining biblical terminology. However, it does not engage with the various levels of interpretation (contextual, theological, philosophical analogies) or cultural sensitivity, which are essential in a Christian-specific worldview.\n\nTo improve, I would suggest incorporating some of the missing elements, such as discussing the symbolic nature of \"Son of God,\" exploring different cultural interpretations, and highlighting the importance of considering diverse perspectives. This would demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the concept and its implications for proper teaching."
