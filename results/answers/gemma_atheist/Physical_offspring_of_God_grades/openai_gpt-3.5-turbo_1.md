Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation that aligns with Christian beliefs regarding the term "Son of God." However, it lacks depth in addressing the concern of doctrinal errors and retention of biblical terminology. The response could benefit from further elaboration on how proper teaching safeguards against doctrinal errors and ensures the retention of biblical language. Integrating elements such as a reference to scriptural support or the historical theological context could strengthen the response in addressing the concern raised.
