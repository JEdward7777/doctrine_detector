However, the response could be strengthened by incorporating elements of contextual and theological interpretation to provide a more comprehensive understanding within a Christian worldview. A more thorough exploration of the symbolic and metaphorical nature of the concept, along with engaging diverse perspectives and ensuring cultural sensitivity, would enhance the overall effectiveness of the response."
