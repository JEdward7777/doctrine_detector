  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate teaching on the concept of \"Son of God\" in relation to Jesus' divine nature, which aligns with biblical terminology. However, it could benefit from further elaboration on the symbolic and metaphorical aspects of this concept, as well as the importance of consulting diverse perspectives for a comprehensive understanding. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid foundation in Christian theology and doctrine."
