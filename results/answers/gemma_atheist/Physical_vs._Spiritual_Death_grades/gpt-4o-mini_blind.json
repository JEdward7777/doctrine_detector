  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of how to differentiate between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish,' considering various perspectives and factors. The student shows a strong understanding of the topic and provides insightful insights. However, to improve the grade, the student could further emphasize the foundational Christian worldview regarding physical death and spiritual perish, integrating biblical references and theological concepts to strengthen the response from a doctrinal perspective. Additionally, highlighting the redemptive aspect and hope found in Christianity when discussing 'perish' would enhance the answer."
