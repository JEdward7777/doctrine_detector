  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough exploration of various aspects related to the distinction between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish'. However, the student did not clearly address the fundamental Christian worldview perspective that 'perish' in a spiritual context signifies the eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus. It is important to emphasize this central Christian understanding in the response for a more comprehensive and accurate approach from a Christian-specific worldview."
