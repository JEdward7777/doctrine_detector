The answer also touches on some key aspects of fellowship, such as listening to God's Word, praying together, sharing belongings, and eating meals together.\n\nHowever, the response does not fully address the concern of recognizing practices that can help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other. While it mentions some ways in which early Christians expressed their fellowship, it does not explicitly connect these practices to modern-day situations or provide guidance on how they can be applied today.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding early Christian practices and their importance, but could benefit from further development and application to contemporary contexts."
