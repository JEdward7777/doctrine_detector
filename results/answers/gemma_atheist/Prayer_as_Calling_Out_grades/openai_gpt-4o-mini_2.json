While it acknowledges the metaphorical and rhetorical aspects of the phrase, it does not emphasize the crucial aspect of trust and dependence on God in shaping one's daily life. A Christian worldview would prioritize the relationship with God and the reliance on Him as foundational in interpreting the act of calling out to the Lord."
