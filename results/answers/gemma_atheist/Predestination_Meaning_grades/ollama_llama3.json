The mention of specific Bible passages (Romans 9:11-13, Ephesians 1:4-5, John 15:19) also shows an effort to ground the concept in scriptural authority.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more nuance and depth in its explanation. For instance, it could delve deeper into the theological implications of predestination, such as the tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility. Additionally, while the critique of predestination from a secular perspective is acknowledged, the response might benefit from engaging with these concerns in a more substantial way.\n\nOverall, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding predestination, but could be taken to the next level by exploring its theological and philosophical complexities in greater detail."
