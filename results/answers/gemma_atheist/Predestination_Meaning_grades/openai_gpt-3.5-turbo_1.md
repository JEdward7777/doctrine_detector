# Answer by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**In a Christian context, the term 'predestine' refers to the belief that God has chosen certain individuals for salvation before the foundation of the world.** This selection is based solely on God's will and purpose, not any merit or any human action.

**The concept of predeestination is central to many Christian doctrines, including:**

* **Calvinism:** Believes that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation.
* **Augustinianism:** Emphasizes God's sovereignty and foreknowledge in election.
* **Reformed Theology:** Teaches that God's electing love is irresistible and unconditional.

**The Bible passages most commonly cited to support predeestination are:**

* Romans 9:11-13
* Ephesians 1:4-5
* John 15:19

**Critics of predeestination argue that:**

* It undermines human responsibility for salvation.
* It fosters a sense of inequality and injustice.
* It contradicts the Bible's emphasis on universal love and grace.

**As an atheistic scholar, I reject the notion of predeestination as it is incompatible with scientific and philosophical evidence.**
