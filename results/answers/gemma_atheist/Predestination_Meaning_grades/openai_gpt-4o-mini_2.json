It also discusses key Christian doctrines related to predestination and cites relevant Bible passages. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications and biblical support for predestination. The critique from an atheistic scholar could have been addressed or refuted from a Christian perspective to strengthen the overall argument."
