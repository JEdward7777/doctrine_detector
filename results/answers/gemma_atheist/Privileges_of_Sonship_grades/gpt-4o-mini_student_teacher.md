Grade: 30

Comment: The student correctly identified that the provided text did not explicitly mention adopted children of God, which is a valid observation. However, the student missed the opportunity to draw on their knowledge of Christian theology to explain the concept of adoption as discussed in Romans 8:14-15 and provide an answer based on a Christian worldview. The grade reflects the student's appropriate recognition of the limitation of the given text but also the missed opportunity to engage with the Christian perspective on adoption into God's family.
