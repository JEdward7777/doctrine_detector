However, it falls short from a Christian worldview perspective by neglecting to acknowledge the Christian interpretation and application of the term. The perspective presented is primarily historical and critical, overlooking the spiritual and theological dimensions that Christian theology would emphasize in understanding the concept of \"Daughter of Zion.\" To improve, the student should incorporate more insight from a Christian perspective and explore how this term is understood in the context of the New Testament and Christian eschatology."
