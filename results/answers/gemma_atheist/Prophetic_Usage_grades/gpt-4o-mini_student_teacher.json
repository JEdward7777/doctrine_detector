  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough overview of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in Biblical prophecies from a cultural and historical perspective, they fail to acknowledge its significance within Christianity. A Christian worldview would emphasize the spiritual and prophetic implications of this term in relation to the relationship between God and His people, particularly in the context of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of such prophecies. The student's perspective as an atheist scholar also detracts from a Christian-specific interpretation of the term."
