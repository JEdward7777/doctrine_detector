  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in Biblical prophecies, providing a comprehensive analysis of its cultural, religious, and historical significance. \n\nThe student effectively highlights the primary usage of the term in Jewish prophetic literature, while also acknowledging the debate and controversy surrounding its interpretation. The inclusion of an atheist perspective adds depth to the discussion by challenging literal interpretations and encouraging a critical approach to religious texts. \n\nHowever, the grade could be improved by providing more specific examples of prophecies where the term \"Daughter of Zion\" is used, and by elaborating on the theological significance of the term within Christian traditions."
