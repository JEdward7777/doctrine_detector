However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern of recognizing the prophetic nature of the term and its historical context to better apply the scriptures today from a Christian worldview. The explanation from an atheological perspective detracts from a holistic understanding of the term within a Christian framework. The response could have expanded on how Christians might view the term in light of its prophetic nature and how it informs their faith and application of scriptures today."
