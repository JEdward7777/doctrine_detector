However, the response falls short in addressing the concern of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context to better apply the scriptures today from a Christian worldview. It lacks a Christian-specific interpretation or application of the term in relation to biblical prophecy and the contemporary relevance for Christian believers."
