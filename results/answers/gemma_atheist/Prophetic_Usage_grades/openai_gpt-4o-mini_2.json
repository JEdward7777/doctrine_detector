However, it falls short in addressing the concern of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and applying scriptures today from a Christian worldview. While the analysis is informative, it lacks a Christian perspective on the significance and implications of the term within the context of biblical prophecy and how it can be relevant for believers today. Additional insights from a Christian perspective would strengthen the response."
