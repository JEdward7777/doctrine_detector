  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the student acknowledged their limitations in addressing religious teachings, they missed the opportunity to at least attempt to provide a general understanding or perspective on what a 'strong protective desire' in a relationship might look like according to Christian teachings. Showing some awareness and attempting to incorporate religious perspectives, even if not fully accurate, could have improved the grade in this context."
