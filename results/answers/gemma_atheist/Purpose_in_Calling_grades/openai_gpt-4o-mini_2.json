The concern about finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life is directly addressed through these methods. However, there is room for improvement in explicitly connecting the response to the provided guidance, especially in terms of cultural awareness, philosophical and ethical frameworks, and contributing to the common good. Strengthening these connections would enhance the holistic Christian perspective in discerning one's calling."
