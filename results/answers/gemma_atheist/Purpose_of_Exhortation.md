## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is not to establish theological dogma or blind obedience, but to **motivate and empower individuals to live out their faith** in practical ways. It involves encouraging and challenging believers to engage in ethical behavior, spiritual growth, and social justice.

The New Testament writers used exhortation to:

* **Remind believers of their identity in Christ:** Exhortations emphasize the privileges and responsibilities associated with being followers of Jesus.
* **Challenge their behavior:** Writers called for lives characterized by love, forgiveness, and integrity.
* **Encourage them in difficult times:** Exhortations remind believers of God's faithfulness and provide guidance for overcoming trials.
* **Inspire them to action:** Writers often urged practical actions, such as generosity, hospitality, and serving others.

Therefore, the primary focus of exhortation is not to enforce religious rules, but to **empower individuals to live out their faith in meaningful ways**.
