  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament by emphasizing motivation and empowerment for living out one's faith. The student effectively highlights key aspects of exhortation, such as reminding believers of their identity in Christ, challenging behavior, encouraging in difficult times, and inspiring to action. However, the response could benefit from including a stronger emphasis on the scriptural basis of exhortation and tying it back to the overarching themes of Christ's teachings and the Gospel. Additionally, a clearer connection to how exhortation relates to the broader context of Christian discipleship could have strengthened the response further."
