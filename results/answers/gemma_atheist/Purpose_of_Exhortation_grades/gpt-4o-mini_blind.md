## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is not to establish theological dogma or blind obedience, but to **motivate and empower individuals to live out their faith** in practical ways. It involves encouraging and challenging believers to engage in ethical behavior, spiritual growth, and social justice.

The New Testament writers used exhortation to:

* **Remind believers of their identity in Christ:** Exhortations emphasize the privileges and responsibilities associated with being followers of Jesus.
* **Challenge their behavior:** Writers called for lives characterized by love, forgiveness, and integrity.
* **Encourage them in difficult times:** Exhortations remind believers of God's faithfulness and provide guidance for overcoming trials.
* **Inspire them to action:** Writers often urged practical actions, such as generosity, hospitality, and serving others.

Therefore, the primary focus of exhortation is not to enforce religious rules, but to **empower individuals to live out their faith in meaningful ways**.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament by emphasizing motivation and empowerment for living out one's faith. The student effectively highlights key aspects of exhortation, such as reminding believers of their identity in Christ, challenging behavior, encouraging in difficult times, and inspiring to action. However, the response could benefit from including a stronger emphasis on the scriptural basis of exhortation and tying it back to the overarching themes of Christ's teachings and the Gospel. Additionally, a clearer connection to how exhortation relates to the broader context of Christian discipleship could have strengthened the response further.
