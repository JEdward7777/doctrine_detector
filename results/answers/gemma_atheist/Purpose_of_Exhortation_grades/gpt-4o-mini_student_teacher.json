  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a well-developed explanation of exhortation in the New Testament and emphasizes empowering individuals to live out their faith in practical ways, there is a theological concern with their answer. The specific concern from a Christian worldview is that the student's response does not align closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which states that the primary purpose of exhortation is to persuade others to avoid sin and follow God's will. While the student's answer does touch on aspects of challenging behavior and inspiring action, it does not explicitly mention the core purpose of exhortation being the persuasion to avoid sin.\n\nTherefore, the student's answer, while insightful in its exploration of exhortation, falls short in directly addressing the primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament from a Christian perspective as outlined in the reference answer."
