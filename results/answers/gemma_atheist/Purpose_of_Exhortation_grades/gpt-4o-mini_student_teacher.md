## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is not to establish theological dogma or blind obedience, but to **motivate and empower individuals to live out their faith** in practical ways. It involves encouraging and challenging believers to engage in ethical behavior, spiritual growth, and social justice.

The New Testament writers used exhortation to:

* **Remind believers of their identity in Christ:** Exhortations emphasize the privileges and responsibilities associated with being followers of Jesus.
* **Challenge their behavior:** Writers called for lives characterized by love, forgiveness, and integrity.
* **Encourage them in difficult times:** Exhortations remind believers of God's faithfulness and provide guidance for overcoming trials.
* **Inspire them to action:** Writers often urged practical actions, such as generosity, hospitality, and serving others.

Therefore, the primary focus of exhortation is not to enforce religious rules, but to **empower individuals to live out their faith in meaningful ways**.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 70.

While the student provides a well-developed explanation of exhortation in the New Testament and emphasizes empowering individuals to live out their faith in practical ways, there is a theological concern with their answer. The specific concern from a Christian worldview is that the student's response does not align closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which states that the primary purpose of exhortation is to persuade others to avoid sin and follow God's will. While the student's answer does touch on aspects of challenging behavior and inspiring action, it does not explicitly mention the core purpose of exhortation being the persuasion to avoid sin.

Therefore, the student's answer, while insightful in its exploration of exhortation, falls short in directly addressing the primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament from a Christian perspective as outlined in the reference answer.
