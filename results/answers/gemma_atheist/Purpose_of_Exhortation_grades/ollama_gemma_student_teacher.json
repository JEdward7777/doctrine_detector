  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* The student clearly articulates that exhortation is about empowering individuals to live out their faith, not establishing rigid theological dogma.\n* The student identifies several ways the New Testament writers used exhortation, focusing on reminding believers of their identity, challenging their behavior, encouraging them in tough times, and inspiring action.\n* The student connects exhortation to practical actions like generosity, hospitality, and social justice.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The student's answer aligns more with a motivational or inspirational approach to exhortation rather than a persuasive or theological one. \n* While it mentions the importance of challenging behavior, the student doesn't elaborate on how exhortation confronts sin or encourages conformity to God's will.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student's response would benefit from further elaboration on the theological aspects of exhortation, specifically how it relates to convincing others of the need to avoid sin and follow God's will.\n* The connection between exhortation and influencing behavior could be further strengthened by referencing specific passages from the New Testament where exhortation is used in this way."
