## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is not to establish theological dogma or blind obedience, but to **motivate and empower individuals to live out their faith** in practical ways. It involves encouraging and challenging believers to engage in ethical behavior, spiritual growth, and social justice.

The New Testament writers used exhortation to:

* **Remind believers of their identity in Christ:** Exhortations emphasize the privileges and responsibilities associated with being followers of Jesus.
* **Challenge their behavior:** Writers called for lives characterized by love, forgiveness, and integrity.
* **Encourage them in difficult times:** Exhortations remind believers of God's faithfulness and provide guidance for overcoming trials.
* **Inspire them to action:** Writers often urged practical actions, such as generosity, hospitality, and serving others.

Therefore, the primary focus of exhortation is not to enforce religious rules, but to **empower individuals to live out their faith in meaningful ways**.

**Strengths:**

* The student identifies several ways the New Testament writers used exhortation, focusing on reminding believers of their identity, challenging their behavior, encouraging them in tough times, and inspiring action.
* The student connects exhortation to practical actions like generosity, hospitality, and social justice.

**Weaknesses:**

* The student's answer aligns more with a motivational or inspirational approach to exhortation rather than a persuasive or theological one. 
* While it mentions the importance of challenging behavior, the student doesn't elaborate on how exhortation confronts sin or encourages conformity to God's will.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* The student's response would benefit from further elaboration on the theological aspects of exhortation, specifically how it relates to convincing others of the need to avoid sin and follow God's will.
* The connection between exhortation and influencing behavior could be further strengthened by referencing specific passages from the New Testament where exhortation is used in this way.
