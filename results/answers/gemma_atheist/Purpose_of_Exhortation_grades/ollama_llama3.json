  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response accurately understands that the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is not to establish theological dogma or enforce obedience, but rather to motivate and empower individuals to live out their faith in practical ways. It also correctly identifies specific examples of how the New Testament writers used exhortation, such as reminding believers of their identity in Christ, challenging their behavior, encouraging them in difficult times, and inspiring them to action.\n\nThe response is well-organized and easy to follow, making it clear that the primary focus of exhortation is not on enforcing religious rules, but rather on empowering individuals to live out their faith in meaningful ways. The only minor area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly addressed the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, although it does provide some relevant biblical examples and principles.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern of understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey."
