  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, emphasizing empowerment and practical application of faith rather than mere enforcement of rules. The argument is well-supported with examples from the New Testament. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include direct biblical references to support each point made. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey from a Christian worldview."
