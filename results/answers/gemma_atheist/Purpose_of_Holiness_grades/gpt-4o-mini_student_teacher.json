  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that integrates both cultural and Biblical perspectives on holiness. The response emphasizes the importance of ethical conduct, spiritual growth, social engagement, humility, gratitude, contextual understanding, interfaith dialogue, inclusive practices, balancing tradition with progress, authenticity, and the transformative journey of living a holy life. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly referencing God's commandments, practices that bring glory to Him, and the role of the Holy Spirit in transforming believers to live holy lives, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer."
