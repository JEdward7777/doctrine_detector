* This involves practices like prayer, fasting, and selfless service to others.

**Living a Holy Life:**

* **Spiritual Growth:** Engaging in personal study, meditation, and reflection to deepen one's faith.
* **Social Engagement:** Serving the community and caring for those in need.

**Key Considerations:**
