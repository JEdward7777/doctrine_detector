It effectively expands on the original answer by outlining specific practices and behaviors that align with biblical principles of holiness while also addressing the importance of cultural contexts, ethical conduct, humility, and balance in living a holy life. The integration of key considerations and the conclusion further enhance the depth and clarity of the response. Well-developed and thoughtfully articulated. Great job!"
