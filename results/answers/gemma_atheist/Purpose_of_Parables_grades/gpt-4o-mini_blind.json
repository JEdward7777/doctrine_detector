The explanation is well-detailed and aligns with the perspective of how Jesus used parables to convey deeper spiritual messages in a relatable and impactful manner. The response could further benefit from directly emphasizing how parables were used as a way for Jesus to both reveal and conceal spiritual truths, reflecting the dual purpose of his teachings in fulfilling prophecy and revealing the kingdom of God to those receptive to it."
