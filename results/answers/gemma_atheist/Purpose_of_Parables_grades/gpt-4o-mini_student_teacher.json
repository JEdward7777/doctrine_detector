  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the purposes of Jesus using parables in his teachings, covering various aspects such as cultural accessibility, simplicity, engaging attention, illustrating spiritual truths, challenging assumptions, and promoting reflection. However, the primary purpose specified in the reference answer - that Jesus used parables to reveal truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe - was not directly addressed. The student's answer focused more on the accessibility, impact, and universal nature of parables rather than emphasizing the selective revelation of truth. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the teaching methods of Jesus in relation to faith, but could have aligned more closely with the specific concern provided."
