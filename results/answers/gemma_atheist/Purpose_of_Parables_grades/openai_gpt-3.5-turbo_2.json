  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the multifaceted purposes of Jesus' use of parables, connecting them to cultural accessibility, simplicity, transcending boundaries, engaging attention, illustrating spiritual truths, challenging assumptions, and promoting reflection. The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring how Jesus' teaching methods through parables impact faith and understanding. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly tie the explanation back to the given answer, showing a direct connection between the significance of parables and the revelation of truth to believers versus non-believers."
