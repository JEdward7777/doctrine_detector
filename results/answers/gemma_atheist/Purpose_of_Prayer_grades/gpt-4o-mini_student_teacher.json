  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of the key purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible, encompassing various aspects such as communication with God, petition and intercession, confession and reconciliation, gratitude and praise, strength and encouragement, transformation and growth, as well as community and fellowship. However, the student's response goes beyond the reference answer and introduces perspectives from an atheistic worldview at the end, which may not align with a strictly Christian perspective on the topic. This detracts from the overall coherence and consistency of the response within a Christian worldview."
