  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and thoughtful exploration of the role of the Psalms in the worship practices of ancient Israel. The student effectively highlights the Psalms' functions in expressing collective grief, transformation, public praise, royal and common use, and their influence on later religious traditions. The mention of cultural appropriation considerations demonstrates awareness and sensitivity. The response could be enhanced by incorporating more explicit references to the Psalms' connection to Yahweh's covenant with Israel and the reinforcement of faith in God's sovereignty. Overall, a commendable analysis with room for further theological depth."
