Grade: 70

Comment: The student provides a comprehensive overview of the various roles the Psalms played in the worship practices of ancient Israel. They demonstrate a good understanding of how the Psalms were used for collective grief, public praise, and as a precursor to later religious traditions. However, the answer could have been strengthened by focusing more on the central theme of worship, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. They also address cultural appropriation appropriately, showing sensitivity towards interpreting religious texts within their historical contexts. Overall, a solid response but could have been more focused on the specific concern of understanding worship through Psalms.
