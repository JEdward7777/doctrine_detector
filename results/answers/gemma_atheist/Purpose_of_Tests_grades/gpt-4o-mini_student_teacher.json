  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided an answer from an atheistic perspective, which does not align with the Christian worldview. The student failed to address the purpose of tests being allowed by God as stated in the reference answer, which is to expose sin, help people turn away from sin, and draw closer to God. The student's focus on cultural interpretations and criticisms without acknowledging the Christian perspective resulted in a low grade. It is important to provide responses that reflect the specific worldview being discussed."
