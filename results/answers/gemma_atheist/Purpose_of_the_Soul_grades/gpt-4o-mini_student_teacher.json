  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response fails to engage with the question and concern at hand, which specifically ask about the soul's relationship to a person's relationship with God as described in scripture and how this understanding influences spiritual life and moral decisions. The student's focus on atheistic perspectives, cultural constructs, historical origins, and ethical considerations is irrelevant to the given question and concern from a Christian worldview. The answer lacks any discussion of the soul's role in connecting with God as described in scripture, leading to a low grade."
