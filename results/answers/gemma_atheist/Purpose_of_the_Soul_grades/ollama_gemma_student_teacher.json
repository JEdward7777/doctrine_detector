  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the philosophical, cultural, and religious aspects of the soul and its relationship to God as described in scripture. They effectively articulate the lack of scientific evidence for the soul and critically analyze the cultural origins and interpretations of this concept. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of the soul in Christian theology and its influence on spiritual life and moral decisions."
