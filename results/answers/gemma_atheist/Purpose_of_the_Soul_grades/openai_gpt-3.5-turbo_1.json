However, it fails to address the concern regarding the influence of the soul's relationship to God on a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions from a Christian worldview. The perspective lacks acknowledgment of the importance and significance of the soul as described in scripture in shaping one's understanding of God and guiding ethical behavior. A Christian-specific worldview would place a higher emphasis on the intrinsic value and eternal nature of the soul as a key component of human identity and accountability before God, impacting one's spiritual life and moral decisions."
