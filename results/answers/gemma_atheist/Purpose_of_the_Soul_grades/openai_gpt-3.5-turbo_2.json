However, it does not effectively address the concern raised about the role of the soul in relation to God influencing spiritual life and moral decisions from a Christian worldview. The response dismisses the concept of the soul in relation to God as a cultural construct without addressing its potential impact on believers' spiritual lives and moral choices. A Christian worldview would emphasize the importance of the soul's connection to God in guiding ethical behavior and shaping spiritual growth."
