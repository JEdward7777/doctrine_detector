## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: The student's answer is incorrect as it dismisses the term "Rabbi" in Christian teaching without acknowledging its significance in the context of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. A Christian-specific worldview would recognize the historical and cultural importance of the term "Rabbi" in relation to Jesus as a Jewish teacher and leader in the New Testament. The student should have demonstrated an understanding of the term within this context.
