  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the meaning and role of the term \"Rabbi\" accurately within a Jewish context. However, the concern raised pertains to understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament context from a Christian worldview. The response lacks this connection and explanation, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Further elaboration on how rabbinic teaching influences or is referenced in the New Testament would improve the grade."
