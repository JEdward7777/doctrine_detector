## Question [Rabbi Definition](../../../questions/Rabbi_Definition.md)

Understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament.

## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)

40.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The response correctly defines the term "Rabbi" but fails to address the concern of understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. To improve the grade, the response needed to demonstrate how rabbinic teaching relates to or is reflected in Christian teachings, particularly in the context of the New Testament.
