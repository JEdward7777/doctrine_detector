## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 65

Comment: The response adequately defines the term "Rabbi" and provides accurate information about the role of a Jewish religious teacher. However, the concern specified a focus on understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, which this response does not directly address. To improve the grade, the response could have connected the definition of "Rabbi" to its relevance in the New Testament, showcasing how rabbinic teachings influenced early Christianity or were referenced by Jesus and the apostles.
