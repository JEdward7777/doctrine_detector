The initial response fails to address this concern and inaccurately states that the term \"Rabbi\" is not used in Christian teaching, which is not true as Jesus himself was referred to as \"Rabbi\" in the New Testament. It missed the opportunity to discuss the Jewish roots and influences on Christianity through the teachings of Jewish rabbis like Jesus."
