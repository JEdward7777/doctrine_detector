  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response regarding the significance of Jesus being referred to as a ransom in Christianity. They effectively highlighted the theological interpretation, cultural context, redemption and reconciliation aspects, moral implications, and eschatological significance of this concept. The points presented align well with Christian doctrine and offer a comprehensive understanding of the topic. However, the student could enhance their answer by including more Scriptural references to support their points and by addressing potential objections to the ransom theory within Christianity."
