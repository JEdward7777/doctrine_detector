It effectively connects the concept of Jesus as a ransom to the idea of redemption and salvation, emphasizing the importance of Jesus' sacrifice in purchasing freedom from sin. The only slight deduction in points is due to the mention that the ransom theory is not universally accepted among theologians and scholars, which could lead to some ambiguity regarding the concept of redemption in Christianity. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
