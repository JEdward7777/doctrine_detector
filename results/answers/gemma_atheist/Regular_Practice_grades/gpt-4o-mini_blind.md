Grade: 20/100

Comment: The answer provided is incorrect from a Christian worldview perspective. The Apostle Paul explicitly refers to the institution of the Lord's Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 when he states, "For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.'" Therefore, Paul did establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers, contrary to the response provided.
