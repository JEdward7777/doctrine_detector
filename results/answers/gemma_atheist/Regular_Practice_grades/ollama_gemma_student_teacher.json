  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer correctly points out that there is no textual evidence to support the claim that Paul established the Lord's Supper as a regular practice. However, it lacks nuance and fails to engage with the concern of the teacher, who is explicitly recognizing the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. The student could have elaborated on the historical development of the practice of the Lord's Supper and its significance within Christian tradition."
