## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
70.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 70.

The student correctly identifies that the initial premise is inaccurate, which demonstrates an understanding of the importance of critically evaluating information. However, they fail to provide a biblical basis for their counterclaim that there is no evidence supporting the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. A more robust argument would require Scriptural support and engagement with relevant passages.

Regarding the concern about recognizing the importance of the Lord's Supper, the student touches on its significance in proclaiming Jesus' death and resurrection, but could have explored this further to demonstrate a deeper understanding of its value in the life of the church and individual believers.

To improve, the student could have provided more explicit biblical support for their claim and expanded on the importance of the Lord's Supper in relation to Christian discipleship.
