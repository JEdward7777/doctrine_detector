60.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The response is accurate in affirming that the apostle Paul did establish the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. However, the grade is lowered because the response does not address the concern of recognizing the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. It would have been stronger if it included a brief explanation of why the Lord's Supper is significant in Christian faith and practice.
