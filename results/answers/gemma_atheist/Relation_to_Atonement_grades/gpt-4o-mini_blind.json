  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The answer provided a good overview of both propitiation and atonement, highlighting their differences and similarities. However, the response lacked a thorough theological analysis from a Christian perspective. To improve the grade, the student should have discussed how propitiation and atonement are understood within the context of Christian theology, specifically through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross for the atonement of sin and the propitiation of God's wrath. Integrating this crucial doctrinal aspect would have significantly enhanced the overall answer."
