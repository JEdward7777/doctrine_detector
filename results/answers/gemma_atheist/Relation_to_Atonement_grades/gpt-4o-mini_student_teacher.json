  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student effectively addresses the concern by providing a comprehensive comparison between propitiation and atonement, highlighting key differences and similarities. The student's explanation is clear and well-organized, however, the teacher's reference answer offers a more concise and focused explanation by emphasizing the appeasement of God's wrath in propitiation. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated."
