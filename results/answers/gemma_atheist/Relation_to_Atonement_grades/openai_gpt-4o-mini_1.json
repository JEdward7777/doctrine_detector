It offers clear definitions, contrasts the concepts well, and provides insightful examples to illustrate the relationship between the two terms. However, it could further emphasize the distinct theological implications of propitiation and atonement within a Christian worldview, specifically highlighting the unique role of Jesus Christ in the atonement process."
