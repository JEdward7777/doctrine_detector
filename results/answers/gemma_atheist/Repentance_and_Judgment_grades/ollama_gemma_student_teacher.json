  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the relationship between repentance and God's wrath from a Christian perspective. They provide solid biblical evidence to support their claims and acknowledge the cultural context of interpreting biblical texts. However, the inclusion of an atheist perspective at the end of the answer is unnecessary and does not contribute to the overall argument."
