The response could have more explicitly highlighted the significance of repentance as essential for avoiding God's judgment and receiving His mercy, aligning more closely with the specified concern. Additionally, the inclusion of the atheist perspective, while providing a broader perspective, detracts from a focused Christian worldview evaluation of the issue."
