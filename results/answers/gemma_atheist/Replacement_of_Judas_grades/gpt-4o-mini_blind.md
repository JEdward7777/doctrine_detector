Grade: 50

Comment: The student correctly notes that there is no explicit replacement mentioned in the Bible for Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. However, the Bible does record the selection of Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot in Acts 1:23-26. The answer could have been improved by providing this biblical reference.
