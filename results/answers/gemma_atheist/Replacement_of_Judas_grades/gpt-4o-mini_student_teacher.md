Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer is partially correct in recognizing that Judas Iscariot was not replaced during Jesus' ministry, but they failed to acknowledge the biblical account in Acts where Matthias was chosen to replace Judas after his betrayal and death. In a Christian worldview, it is important to acknowledge the continuity of apostolic leadership to fulfill Jesus' plan for the foundation of the Church.
