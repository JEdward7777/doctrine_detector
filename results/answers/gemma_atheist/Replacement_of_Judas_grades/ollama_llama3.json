  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response directly addresses the concern by acknowledging the replacement of Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, which shows recognition of the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The statement \"Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after Judas' betrayal and subsequent death\" is a clear and accurate representation of the biblical account (Acts 1:21-26).\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to further explain how this event demonstrates the continuity of apostolic leadership, rather than simply stating it. However, overall, the response effectively addresses the concern and provides a clear answer to the original question.\n\nComment: The response could be strengthened by providing more context or explanation about how Matthias' selection shows the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension."
