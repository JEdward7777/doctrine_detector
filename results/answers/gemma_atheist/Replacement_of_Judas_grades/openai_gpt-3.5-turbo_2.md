Comment: The response correctly addresses the concern by highlighting the appointment of Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot, thereby maintaining continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The initial response's claim that there is no historical evidence of Judas Iscariot being replaced is inaccurate based on Christian beliefs and biblical accounts.
