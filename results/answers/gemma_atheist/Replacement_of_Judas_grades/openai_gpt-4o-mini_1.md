Grade: 95

Comment: The response accurately provides the Christian perspective that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, showing recognition of the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The deduction in points is due to the inaccurate assertion in the initial response that there is no historical evidence for Judas' replacement, which goes against Christian teachings and biblical accounts.
