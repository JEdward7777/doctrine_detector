  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response is accurate in stating that the provided text does not contain information regarding Peter's specific address to the crowd about their role in the crucifixion. However, a higher grade could be achieved by mentioning that Peter did address the crowd about their responsibility for crucifying Jesus in Acts 2:23, where he boldly proclaimed that the crowd had crucified Jesus by lawless hands. This additional information would have shown a deeper understanding of the biblical passage."
