  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response correctly acknowledges that the provided text does not contain the information being asked about, which shows an understanding of the limitations of the given context. However, it does not attempt to provide any further insight or analysis beyond stating the obvious. The concern is specifically about evaluating the early church's preaching and call to respond to the gospel, but this response does not engage with that concern in a meaningful way.\n\nTo improve, the response could have attempted to provide some contextual insight into how Peter's preaching might have addressed the crowd's role in Jesus' crucifixion, or how it relates to the broader theme of calling people to repentance and faith."
