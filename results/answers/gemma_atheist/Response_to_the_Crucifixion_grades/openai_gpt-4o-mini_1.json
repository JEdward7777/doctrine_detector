  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided lacks depth and analysis in evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel. While acknowledging the lack of specific information in the given text is important, a more comprehensive exploration of Peter's message and its significance in terms of repentance and faith would have strengthened the response. More emphasis on the implications of Peter's words for the audience's response to the gospel would have improved the grade."
