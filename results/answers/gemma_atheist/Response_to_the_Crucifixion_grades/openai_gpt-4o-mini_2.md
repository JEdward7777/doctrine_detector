## Grade by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
85.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the early church's preaching message which emphasized the need for repentance and faith in Jesus. The concern about the call to respond to the gospel is addressed well in light of a Christian worldview. The deduction in grade is due to the initial response not directly addressing the question in context with Peter's speech.
