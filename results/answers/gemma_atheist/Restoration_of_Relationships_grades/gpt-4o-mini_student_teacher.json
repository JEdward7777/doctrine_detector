  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's answer does not address the significance of reconciliation in the Christian faith as required by the concern. From a Christian worldview, reconciliation is not merely about personal growth, community renewal, or psychological healing; it is about the restoration of a broken relationship between God and sinful individuals. The answer provided by the student is highly inadequate in addressing the specific concerns from a Christian perspective."
