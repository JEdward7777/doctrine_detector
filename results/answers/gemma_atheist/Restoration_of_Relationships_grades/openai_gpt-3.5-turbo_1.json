As an atheist scholar, the explanation focuses solely on secular and humanistic interpretations, completely missing the Christian worldview's emphasis on God's role in restoring sinful individuals back into fellowship with Himself. There is a lack of acknowledgment of the spiritual aspect of reconciliation in the Christian faith."
