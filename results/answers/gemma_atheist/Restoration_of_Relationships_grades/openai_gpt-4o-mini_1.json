The perspective from an atheistic viewpoint was well articulated, but it did not engage with the Christian-specific concern provided. In a Christian worldview, the importance of reconciliation with God through Christ's sacrifice is central to understanding restoration. The response missed the opportunity to analyze the deeper theological implications of reconciliation in the context of Christian belief."
