The mention of the significance of the resurrection in Christian theology and culture is appropriate. However, the response could have been strengthened by including more explicit references to key biblical passages such as Jesus' resurrection appearances and the theological implications of His resurrection for believers. Additionally, a clearer distinction between the unique nature of Jesus' resurrection and the general concept of resurrection could have been beneficial."
