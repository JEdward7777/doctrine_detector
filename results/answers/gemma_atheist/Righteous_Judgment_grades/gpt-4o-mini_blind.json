  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: The response provides a comprehensive and well-thought-out explanation of how Christians reconcile the concept of God's wrath with His nature as loving and merciful. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of key theological concepts and effectively articulates the distinctions between God's wrath, justice, mercy, and redemption. The explanation is grounded in biblical teachings and maintains doctrinal correctness throughout. One area for improvement could be providing specific biblical references to support the points made. Overall, a solid and informative response."
