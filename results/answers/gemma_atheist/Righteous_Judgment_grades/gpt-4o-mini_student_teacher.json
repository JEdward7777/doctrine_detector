  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as an 85.\n\nThe student provided a thorough and well-structured response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. They addressed the importance of contextual understanding, made a clear distinction between God's wrath and justice, highlighted the role of mercy and redemption in Christianity, discussed God's character and the concept of reconciliation and grace.\n\nWhile the student's answer covers various aspects of the topic effectively and offers insightful explanations, it could have been improved by directly aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer. Specifically, emphasizing that God's wrath is a part of His justice and holiness would have strengthened the student's response.\n\nOverall, the student's answer shows a solid understanding of the topic, and with a bit more alignment with the specific emphasis on God's justice in the reference answer, it would have received a higher grade."
