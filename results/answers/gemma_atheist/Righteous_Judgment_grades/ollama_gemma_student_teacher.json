The response effectively addresses the concern of reconciling these seemingly contradictory attributes of God. \n\nThe student provides a nuanced explanation of the distinction between wrath and justice, and highlights the importance of understanding the cultural contexts in which these concepts emerge. The inclusion of references to Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate reconciliation between God and humanity adds depth and theological accuracy to the response."
