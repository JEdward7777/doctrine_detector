  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer does not engage with the question from a Christian worldview perspective, which is necessary for understanding the roles of angels as described in biblical references. As an atheist scholar, it is expected that the student would not provide information on angels serving God, but in the context of this question, the lack of relevance to the Christian worldview significantly impacts the grade."
