**Comment:** 

While the student correctly points out the lack of scientific or empirical evidence for the existence of angels, their response fails to engage with the provided concern. The response would be more helpful if it addressed how the student's perspective aligns or differs from the biblical perspective on angels and their service to God. Additionally, the response could elaborate on the various ways angels are depicted serving God in biblical references.
