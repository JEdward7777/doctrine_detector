However, the atheistic perspective presented in the initial response disregards the significance of understanding angels in the context of divine intervention for Christians, which is important for believers in interpreting and experiencing God's intervention in their lives. The answer would benefit from a more nuanced understanding and consideration of the Christian worldview."
