The perspective presented lacks a foundational understanding of Christian doctrine and fails to incorporate biblical principles in discussing the responsibilities of believers within the Church. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, advocating for inclusivity and collaboration should be grounded in the teachings of Scripture and the established order within the Church as outlined in the New Testament. An emphasis on the importance of prayer, discipleship, evangelism, and adherence to biblical teachings in fulfilling one's role within the Church is essential and missing from the response."
