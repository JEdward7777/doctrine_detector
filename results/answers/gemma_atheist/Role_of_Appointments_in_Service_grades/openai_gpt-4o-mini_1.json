The perspective presented is based on atheism, critiquing traditional roles and structures in a way that does not align with Christian beliefs. The suggestions provided are not rooted in biblical principles or the teachings of Jesus Christ. In a Christian-specific worldview, fulfillment within the Church is found through obedience to God's Word, serving with a heart of love and humility, and honoring the established roles and responsibilities outlined in Scripture. The response lacks a biblical foundation and fails to recognize the divine calling and purpose believers have within the body of Christ."
