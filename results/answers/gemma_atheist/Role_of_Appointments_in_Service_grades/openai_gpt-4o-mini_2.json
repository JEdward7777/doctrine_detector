The response focuses more on advocating for inclusivity, empowerment, and challenging hierarchical structures, which, while important, does not align closely with the Christian understanding of roles within the Church as outlined in the provided answer. The response would benefit from incorporating more on the biblical basis for fulfilling roles within the body of Christ and the importance of serving others in accordance with God's will."
