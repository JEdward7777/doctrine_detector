  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 40/100.\n\nWhile the student correctly identifies that their perspective is atheistic and acknowledges the religious narrative of the Passover event, they fail to engage with the question from a Christian perspective. From a Christian worldview, the significance of blood in the Passover event as described in the Bible holds significant theological importance related to redemption, sacrifice, and atonement. The dismissal of its historical and religious significance without acknowledging its spiritual symbolism within Christianity demonstrates a lack of understanding from a Christian perspective. A more comprehensive response, engaging with the biblical teachings on the Passover event and the symbolism of blood in Christian theology, would have garnered a higher grade."
