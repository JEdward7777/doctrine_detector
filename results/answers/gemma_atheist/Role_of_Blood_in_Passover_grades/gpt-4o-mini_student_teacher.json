  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the Christian perspective on the significance of blood in the Passover event and fails to address the concern of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith. Their response dismisses the religious and historical importance of the event as described in the Bible, which contradicts the Christian worldview. The student could benefit from further study on the theological significance of blood in the Bible and how it relates to Christian beliefs in sacrifice and atonement."
