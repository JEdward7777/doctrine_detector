  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the atheistic perspective on the biblical account of the Passover event. They clearly articulate that the event is a religious narrative with symbolic and cultural significance rather than historical or scientific facts. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of blood in the Passover event within the Christian faith, as it does not directly address the specified concern."
