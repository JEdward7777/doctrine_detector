It does not acknowledge the spiritual significance of the blood of the lamb as a foreshadowing of the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the atonement of sins. A Christian worldview values the symbolic representation of blood in the Passover context as a precursor to the shedding of Christ's blood for the forgiveness of sins."
