It fails to acknowledge the Christian belief that the blood of the lamb foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is seen as the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. The response dismisses the religious and historical significance from a Christian worldview, which is crucial in understanding the deeper theological meaning behind the Passover event."
