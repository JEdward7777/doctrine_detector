Grade: 20

Comment: While it is important to be respectful of differing beliefs, in this context, the question specifically asks for an answer that reflects a Christian worldview. Refusing to engage with the question from that perspective limits the depth of analysis and misses the opportunity to explore the role of eunuchs within the framework of God's plan as understood within Christian theology.
