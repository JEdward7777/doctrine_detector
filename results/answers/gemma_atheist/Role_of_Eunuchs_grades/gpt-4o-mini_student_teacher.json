While it is understandable that the student may not feel comfortable speculating on divine plans, in this context, the question specifically asks for an examination of eunuchs in ancient times in relation to God's plan for individuals in society. The student could have engaged with the concept of God's ability to use all individuals for His purposes, including those historically marginalized like eunuchs, without necessarily delving into theological speculation."
