Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively acknowledges the Christian belief that God can use anyone for His purposes regardless of their physical state. It aligns well with the concern of valuing all individuals in God's kingdom. The only minor drawback is the lack of a direct scriptural reference or deeper theological explanation, which could have further strengthened the argument. Overall, a solid response from a Christian worldview perspective.
