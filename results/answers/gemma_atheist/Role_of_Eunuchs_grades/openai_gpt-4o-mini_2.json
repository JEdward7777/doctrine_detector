  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, emphasizing that God can use anyone for His purposes regardless of physical or social status. The only slight deduction is for not directly applying this concept to the specific example of eunuchs as mentioned in the given answer. Overall, a solid response from a Christian worldview."
