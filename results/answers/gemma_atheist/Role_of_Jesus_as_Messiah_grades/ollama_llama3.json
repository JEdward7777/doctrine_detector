The provided answer primarily focuses on Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy and his eternal reign without delving into the cultural implications, Jesus' interpretation, or potential theological perspectives. While recognizing Jesus' importance in God's plan for humanity is crucial, this response could benefit from more nuanced exploration of the kingdom concept to better grasp its significance."
