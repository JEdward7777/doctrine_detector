The discussion effectively ties back to the importance of Jesus' role in God's plan for humanity. However, the response could have delved deeper into the scriptural basis for Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah ruling over God's kingdom with righteousness. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview in discussing Jesus' unique role in fulfilling this prophecy would have further strengthened the response."
