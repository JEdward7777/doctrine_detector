The theological, linguistic, human representation, mediator, fulfillment of prophecy, and cultural context aspects are thoroughly addressed, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The only minor room for improvement would be to explicitly tie back each point to the concern of recognizing Jesus' divinity and role in revealing God."
