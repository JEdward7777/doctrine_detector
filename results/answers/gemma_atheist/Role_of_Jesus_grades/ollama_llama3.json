  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 20.\n\nThe response acknowledges that it cannot provide responses that promote religious or theological beliefs, which aligns with the concern to clarify Jesus' role in the Christian faith. However, the response does not engage with the specific concern about clarifying Jesus' role and its importance for comprehending the Christian faith and nature of redemption.\n\nWhile the response is clear about the limitations of its knowledge base, it does not demonstrate an attempt to understand or address the specified concern. A higher grade would require a more nuanced and thoughtful engagement with the concern, even if the response ultimately falls within the limitations stated."
