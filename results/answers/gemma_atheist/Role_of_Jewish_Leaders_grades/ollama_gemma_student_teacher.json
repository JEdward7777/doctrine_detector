  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response correctly points out that there is no credible historical evidence to support the claim that Jewish religious leaders were solely responsible for Jesus' crucifixion. However, it could have elaborated more on the role of religious authority in influencing the political decision-making process during that time. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the historical context and the dynamics between religious authority and civil power, but lacks nuance in its conclusion."
