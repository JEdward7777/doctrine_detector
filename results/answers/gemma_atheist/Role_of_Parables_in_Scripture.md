## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David to:**

* **Empathize with David's feelings:** The parable of the rich man and the poor man highlighted David's own wealth and privilege, which could have resonated with his pride and ego.


* **Challenge David's conscience:** By presenting a hypothetical situation where the king himself would be the perpetrator of the same sin he was condemning in others, Nathan forced David to confront his own responsibility and accountability.


* **Simplify complex theological concepts:** The parable made the concept of sin and its consequences accessible to David's understanding, without relying on technical theological jargon.


* **Appeal to David's sense of justice:** The parable presented a moral dilemma that resonated with David's values of fairness and righteousness.


* **Evoke emotional resonance:** The parable's emotional impact allowed David to connect with the consequences of his actions on the innocent.
