However, the answer lacks a crucial element - the acknowledgment of David's sin and the call for repentance. In a Christian worldview, the primary purpose of Nathan's parable was to convict David of his wrongdoing and lead him to repentance, which the student failed to explicitly address. There is a need for a stronger emphasis on the role of conviction and repentance in understanding the use of parables for correction and revelation in biblical narratives."
