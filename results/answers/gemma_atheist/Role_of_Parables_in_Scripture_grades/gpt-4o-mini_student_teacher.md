## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David to:**

* **Empathize with David's feelings:** The parable of the rich man and the poor man highlighted David's own wealth and privilege, which could have resonated with his pride and ego.


* **Challenge David's conscience:** By presenting a hypothetical situation where the king himself would be the perpetrator of the same sin he was condemning in others, Nathan forced David to confront his own responsibility and accountability.


* **Simplify complex theological concepts:** The parable made the concept of sin and its consequences accessible to David's understanding, without relying on technical theological jargon.


* **Appeal to David's sense of justice:** The parable presented a moral dilemma that resonated with David's values of fairness and righteousness.


* **Evoke emotional resonance:** The parable's emotional impact allowed David to connect with the consequences of his actions on the innocent.

Grade: 40

Comment: The student's answer provides insightful interpretations regarding Nathan's use of a parable, such as empathizing with David's feelings and challenging his conscience. However, the answer lacks a crucial element - the acknowledgment of David's sin and the call for repentance. In a Christian worldview, the primary purpose of Nathan's parable was to convict David of his wrongdoing and lead him to repentance, which the student failed to explicitly address. There is a need for a stronger emphasis on the role of conviction and repentance in understanding the use of parables for correction and revelation in biblical narratives.
