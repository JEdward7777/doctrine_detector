  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the use of parables in biblical narratives. It provides insightful analysis of how Nathan's parable effectively empathized with David's emotions, challenged his conscience, simplified complex theological concepts, appealed to his sense of justice, and evoked emotional resonance. The response aligns well with the reference answer from the teacher."
