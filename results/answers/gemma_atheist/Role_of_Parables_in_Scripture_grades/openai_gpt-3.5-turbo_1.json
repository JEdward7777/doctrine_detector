The detailed analysis provided on Nathan's approach in using the parable with specific points on empathizing, challenging, simplifying theological concepts, appealing to justice, and evoking emotional resonance shows a comprehensive grasp of the biblical narrative and its implications for David's repentance. Great job!"
