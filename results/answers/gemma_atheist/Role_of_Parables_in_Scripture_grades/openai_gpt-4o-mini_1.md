* **Empathize with David's feelings:** The parable of the rich man and the poor man highlighted David's own wealth and privilege, which could have resonated with his pride and ego.

* **Simplify complex theological concepts:** The parable made the concept of sin and its consequences accessible to David's understanding, without relying on technical theological jargon.


* **Appeal to David's sense of justice:** The parable presented a moral dilemma that resonated with David's values of fairness and righteousness.


* **Evoke emotional resonance:** The parable's emotional impact allowed David to connect with the consequences of his actions on the innocent.
