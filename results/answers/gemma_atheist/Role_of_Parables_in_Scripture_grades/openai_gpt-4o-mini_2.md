## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David to:**

* **Empathize with David's feelings:** The parable of the rich man and the poor man highlighted David's own wealth and privilege, which could have resonated with his pride and ego.


* **Challenge David's conscience:** By presenting a hypothetical situation where the king himself would be the perpetrator of the same sin he was condemning in others, Nathan forced David to confront his own responsibility and accountability.


* **Simplify complex theological concepts:** The parable made the concept of sin and its consequences accessible to David's understanding, without relying on technical theological jargon.


* **Appeal to David's sense of justice:** The parable presented a moral dilemma that resonated with David's values of fairness and righteousness.


* **Evoke emotional resonance:** The parable's emotional impact allowed David to connect with the consequences of his actions on the innocent.

It effectively demonstrates an understanding of how parables are utilized in biblical narratives to bring about correction and revelation. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps delve slightly deeper into the theological implications of using parables in this context. Overall, an excellent response.
