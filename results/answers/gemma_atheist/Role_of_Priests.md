**Considerations for Cultural Retribution:**

It is important to acknowledge that the religious practices and beliefs described in the Bible are rooted in the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel. These practices may not be directly applicable or appropriate in contemporary society.

An atheist scholar should critically examine the biblical texts and their interpretations, considering the cultural biases and power dynamics present in ancient Israelite society.
