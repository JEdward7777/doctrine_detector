According to the Bible, priests in the Old Testament had several primary responsibilities:

**1. Sacrificial Rituals:**

* Performing animal sacrifices and blood offerings to appease God and atone for sin.
* Overseeing the meticulous preparation and offering of sacrifices in the Temple. 
* Understanding and interpreting the significance of different sacrifices and their relationship to specific situations and sins.

**2. Intermediation:**

* Serving as intermediaries between the people and God.
* Offering prayers and pleas for forgiveness, guidance, and blessing.
* Interpreting God's will and pronouncements to the people.

**3. Ritual Purity:**

* Maintaining strict personal purity through dietary restrictions, physical cleanliness, and separation from certain activities and people.
* Performing rituals to cleanse the Temple and sacred objects from pollution.

**4. Teaching and Interpretation:**

* Explaining religious laws, rituals, and prophecies to the people.
* Providing interpretations of the scriptures and their application to daily life.
* Guiding and counseling people in spiritual matters.

**5. Temple Management:**

* Overseeing the physical upkeep and maintenance of the Temple.
* Managing the Temple's resources and personnel.
* Ensuring the proper functioning of the Temple and its rituals.

**6. Social Functions:**

* Administering religious rites of passage, such as ordination and marriage.
* Preserving traditional religious practices and customs.
* Providing moral and spiritual guidance to the community.

**Considerations for Cultural Retribution:**

It is important to acknowledge that the religious practices and beliefs described in the Bible are rooted in the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel. These practices may not be directly applicable or appropriate in contemporary society.

An atheist scholar should critically examine the biblical texts and their interpretations, considering the cultural biases and power dynamics present in ancient Israelite society.
