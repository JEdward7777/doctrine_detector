  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the primary responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament based on the Bible. It highlights important aspects such as sacrificial rituals, intermediation, ritual purity, teaching, temple management, and social functions. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical role of priests and effectively communicates their duties. The inclusion of considerations for cultural retribution also shows a thoughtful reflection on the context of ancient Israel. However, the response could have further elaborated on the spiritual significance and impact of these responsibilities within the Christian faith to enhance the depth of analysis."
