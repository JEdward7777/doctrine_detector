  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the primary roles of a prophet according to the Bible, encompassing communication of divine messages, interpretation of divine will, moral and ethical guidance, social and political commentary, and comfort and encouragement. However, the inclusion of the student's personal atheistic perspective detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the response. In a Christian worldview, the existence of a supernatural being and the authenticity of biblical prophecies are fundamental beliefs, and expressing disbelief in them undermines the accuracy of the answer. The inclusion of this personal perspective significantly lowers the grade."
