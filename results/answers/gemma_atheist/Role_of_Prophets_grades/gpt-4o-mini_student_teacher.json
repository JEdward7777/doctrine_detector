  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10/100\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of the role of prophets according to the Bible, encompassing aspects such as communication of divine messages, interpretation of divine will, moral guidance, social and political commentary, and comfort. However, the response is heavily skewed by the student's atheistic perspective, dismissing the core belief in a supernatural being and the authority of religious texts like the Bible. This divergence from the Christian worldview significantly detracts from the accuracy and appropriateness of the answer. It is essential for the student to engage with the question from a Christian perspective and acknowledge the foundational beliefs of Christianity when discussing biblical roles and teachings."
