However, there is room for further elaboration on other aspects of a prophet's role as outlined in the Bible, such as providing moral guidance, interpreting divine will, and offering comfort. Additionally, addressing the concerns raised in the given response about the interpretation of biblical prophecies and the existence of a supernatural being from a Christian perspective would have strengthened the overall answer."
