However, it lacks depth in covering other aspects of the prophetic role such as interpreting divine will, moral and ethical guidance, social and political commentary, and providing comfort and encouragement as outlined in the Bible. The explanation could be improved by incorporating more scriptural references and a broader perspective on the multifaceted role of prophets in biblical context."
