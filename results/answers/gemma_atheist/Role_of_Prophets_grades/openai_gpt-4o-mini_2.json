However, there was a slight deviation from the specific answer given in focusing solely on warning people to turn away from sins and obey God, missing some key elements such as interpreting divine will and offering comfort and encouragement. The response appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the biblical role of prophets and their messages."
