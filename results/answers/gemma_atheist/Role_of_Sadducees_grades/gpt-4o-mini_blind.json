  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system, covering key aspects such as purification rituals, sacrifices, temple attendance, facilities management, dispute resolution, and ritual instruction. The inclusion of cultural implications and scholarly considerations adds depth to the discussion. However, to improve the grade, the response could have further emphasized the theological significance of the Sadducees' roles within the context of Jewish religious beliefs and practices. Additionally, connecting their responsibilities to specific biblical references could enhance the doctrinal context further."
