  "grade_comment": "Grade: 82\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive overview of the responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system, exploring various aspects such as purification rituals, sacrifices, temple attendance, facilities management, dispute resolution, and ritual instruction. They also touched on cultural implications and scholarly considerations. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the central aspect of the Sadducees' responsibilities, which was taking care of the temple complex and performing priestly tasks, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic but lacked a clear emphasis on the primary responsibilities of the Sadducees."
