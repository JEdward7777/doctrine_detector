  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nWhile the initial answer provided only touches on the Sadducees' responsibilities, the subsequent response goes beyond that to provide a more comprehensive overview of their roles and practices within the Jewish temple system. The additional details provided about purification rituals, sacrifices, temple attendance, facilities, dispute resolution, and ritual instruction demonstrate a good understanding of the Sadducees' responsibilities.\n\nHowever, I would have liked to see more explicit connections made between these responsibilities and the historical context of religious leadership in Jesus' time. While there is some discussion of cultural implications and scholarly considerations, these sections could be further developed to provide more insight into how the Sadducees' practices fit within their historical context.\n\nOverall, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the Sadducees' roles and practices, but could benefit from further exploration of their significance in the broader historical context."
