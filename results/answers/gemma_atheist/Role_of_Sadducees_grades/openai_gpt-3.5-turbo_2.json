  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and detailed overview of the responsibilities of the Sadducees within the Jewish temple system, going beyond the initial answer provided. It accurately addresses the concern by exploring the historical context of religious leadership during the time of Jesus. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the information provided to the specific context of Jesus' time and how the Sadducees interacted with Him."
