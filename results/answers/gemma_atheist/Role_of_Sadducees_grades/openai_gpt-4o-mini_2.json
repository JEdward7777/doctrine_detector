  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and informative overview of the responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system, going beyond just taking care of the temple complex and offering sacrifices. It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus and how the Sadducees fit into that landscape. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect the historical context discussed with the specific responsibilities outlined in the response for a more cohesive analysis."
