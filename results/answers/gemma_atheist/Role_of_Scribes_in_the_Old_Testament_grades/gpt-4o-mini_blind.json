The inclusion of additional considerations and scholarly approaches enhances the depth of the answer. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, there is a lack of emphasis on the divine inspiration and guidance in the preservation of the Scriptures, as well as the significance of scribes in safeguarding God's Word for future generations. Including these theological aspects would have strengthened the response further."
