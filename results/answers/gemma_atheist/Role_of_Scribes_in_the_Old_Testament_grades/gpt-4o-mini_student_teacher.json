  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response regarding the responsibilities of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures. They have considered various aspects such as accuracy, authenticity, preservation, cultural sensitivity, and ethical responsibility. However, while the student's answer is detailed and well-researched, it somewhat veers away from the specific concern of the significance of the scribes' role in biblical history and scripture preservation. The response could have been more focused on directly addressing the importance of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures as mentioned in the reference answer."
