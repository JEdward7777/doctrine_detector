  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response acknowledges the scribes' role in copying and preserving the Old Testament, which shows some understanding of their significance. However, it does not delve deeper into the complexity and nuance of their responsibilities as described in the original text. The response also lacks specific details about the scribes' roles and practices mentioned in the original text, such as maintaining fidelity to the spoken word of God or avoiding cultural biases.\n\nThe grade of 60 reflects that the response provides some basic information about the scribes' role but does not demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of their significance in biblical history."
