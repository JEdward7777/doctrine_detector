  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of witnesses in the New Testament from a scholarly perspective, considering cultural contexts and evaluating evidence. However, the answer lacks a key aspect emphasized in the reference answer, which is the importance of witnesses sharing personal experiences of Jesus' life and resurrection. From a Christian worldview, the focus should be on the firsthand accounts and testimonies of those who followed Jesus, rather than solely on scholarly perspectives. This focus shift impacts the alignment with the Christian specific worldview, leading to a lower grade in this context."
