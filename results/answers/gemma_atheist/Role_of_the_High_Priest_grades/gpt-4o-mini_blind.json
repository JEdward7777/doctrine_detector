The mention of cultural context and the importance of understanding traditional interpretations adds depth to the response. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it would have been beneficial to emphasize the symbolic role of the high priest as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest who atones for the sins of humanity once and for all. Additionally, referencing the high priest's role in offering sacrifices as a precursor to Christ's sacrificial death could have further enriched the response."
