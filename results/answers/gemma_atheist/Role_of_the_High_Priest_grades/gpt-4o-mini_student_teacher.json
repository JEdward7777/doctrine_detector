  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing the unique responsibilities of the high priest in Israel, showing a good understanding of the significance of the high priest's role in worship practices. However, the reference answer given by the teacher emphasizes the high priest's exclusive ability to enter the most holy part of the tabernacle or temple to offer a special sacrifice once per year. While the student covered various aspects of the high priest's role, the specific emphasis on this unique aspect was missing in their response, hence a slight deduction in the grade."
