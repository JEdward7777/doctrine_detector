This aligns with the key role of the high priest in the worship practices of Israel, emphasizing their exclusive access to the divine presence and their crucial role in mediating between God and the people through this annual sacrifice. However, the response could have been more comprehensive by incorporating additional details about the high priest's other significant duties and functions within Israelite religious life."
