The inclusion of considerations for cultural retribution demonstrates a thoughtful and holistic approach to understanding the high priest's role in the worship practices of Israel. The respondent effectively addresses the concern by offering a broader context for the significance of the high priest's role beyond simply entering the most holy part of the tabernacle or temple."
