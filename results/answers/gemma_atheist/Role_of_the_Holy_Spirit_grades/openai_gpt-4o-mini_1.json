The atheistic perspective presented disregards the foundational belief in the indwelling and empowering work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life, dismissing it as subjective experiences influenced solely by psychological, physiological, cultural, and humanistic factors. From a Christian perspective, understanding and acknowledging the role of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life is essential for spiritual growth and guidance in Christian living."
