However, it completely dismisses the Christian belief in the Holy Spirit as a supernatural entity empowering believers after salvation. From a Christian worldview, the Holy Spirit is considered a fundamental aspect of faith and Christian living. The response failed to engage with the concern regarding the crucial role of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life for spiritual growth and guidance, which is essential from a Christian perspective."
