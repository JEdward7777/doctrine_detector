## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**From an atheistic perspective, the concept of the Holy Spirit's involvement in the creation of the world as mentioned in Genesis 1:1-2 is not supported by empirical evidence or scientific theories.**

The Genesis account of creation is a religious narrative with cultural and historical significance, but it is not considered a scientifically accurate representation of the origins of the universe.

**Scientific theories suggest that the formation of the Earth and its inhabitants is a natural and evolutionary process that occurred over millions of years.**
