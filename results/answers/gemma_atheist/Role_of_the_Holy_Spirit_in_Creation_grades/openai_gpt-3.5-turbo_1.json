The response dismisses the scriptural significance of the Holy Spirit's involvement and scientific theories are used to undermine the biblical account. From a Christian worldview, this response would be considered lacking as it disregards the foundational belief in the Trinity and the collaborative work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in creation."
