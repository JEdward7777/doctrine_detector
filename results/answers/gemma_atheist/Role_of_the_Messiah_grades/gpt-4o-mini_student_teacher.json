However, there is a concern with the clarity of the response. While the roles mentioned align with biblical concepts, there is a lack of focus on the key roles of the Messiah as a prophet, priest, and king in starting the New Covenant, as specified in the reference answer. The response could benefit from emphasizing these central roles more clearly to help believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority."
