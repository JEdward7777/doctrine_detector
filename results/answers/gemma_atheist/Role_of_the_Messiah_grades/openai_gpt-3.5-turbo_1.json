  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a decent overview of the Messianic roles in the Bible, but it lacks specificity in connecting those roles to Jesus as the fulfillment of those prophecies. Additionally, it does not explicitly address Jesus as a prophet, priest, and king as indicated in the given answer. More direct integration of the roles mentioned in the response with Jesus's mission and authority would have strengthened the clarity and alignment with the concern provided."
