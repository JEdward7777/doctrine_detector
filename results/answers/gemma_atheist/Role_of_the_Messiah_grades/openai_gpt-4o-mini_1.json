The connection between the Messiah as a prophet, priest, and king starting the New Covenant is implied in the discussion of the various roles mentioned. The explanation could have been more explicit in directly addressing the concern about clarity on the role of the Messiah in relation to Jesus's mission and authority. Clarifying this connection more directly would have strengthened the response further."
