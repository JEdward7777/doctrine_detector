Grade: 20

Comment: While it is understandable that the student may not hold religious beliefs, the response does not engage with the question in a scholarly manner. In the context of a Christian worldview, understanding God's instructions to the Israelites regarding the gathering of manna in relation to the Sabbath is crucial. A more appropriate response would have been to explain the biblical account of God's instructions from a historical and literary standpoint, even if from a secular perspective.
