## Question [Sabbath Observance 2](../../../questions/Sabbath_Observance_2.md)

God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna the day before the Sabbath so they would have enough to eat on their day of rest.

Importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands.

90.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1.md)
Grade: 90

Comment: The response appropriately references the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands by highlighting how God instructed the Israelites to gather extra manna for the day of rest. The only minor deduction comes from the initial response, as an atheist perspective does not align with providing religious interpretations.
