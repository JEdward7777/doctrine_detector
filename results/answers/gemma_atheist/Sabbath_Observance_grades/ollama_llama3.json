It also acknowledges the importance of balance between work and leisure, which aligns with Christian values. However, it falls short in fully grasping the spiritual implications of keeping the Sabbath holy, as commanded by God. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration of how the Sabbath can be used to draw closer to God and reflect on one's relationship with Him."
