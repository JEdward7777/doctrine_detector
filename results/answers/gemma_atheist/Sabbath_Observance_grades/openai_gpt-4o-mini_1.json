While the answer given is not directly aligned with the Christian understanding of the Sabbath, the explanation is well-reasoned and respectful of different beliefs. From a Christian worldview, the response could have incorporated more emphasis on the theological significance of keeping the Sabbath holy in relation to God's commandments and the importance of honoring Him through rest and worship."
