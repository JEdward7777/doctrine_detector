  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 50.\n\nComment:\nWhile the student's response provides a comprehensive analysis of sacrificial love from a cultural and philosophical perspective, it lacks a fundamental understanding of the essence of God's love as demonstrated by Jesus. The student's atheistic worldview may have influenced the interpretation of sacrificial love, missing the core foundation of God's selfless and unconditional love. This answer falls short in reflecting the Christian-specific worldview required to fully understand the concept of sacrificial love demonstrated by Jesus."
