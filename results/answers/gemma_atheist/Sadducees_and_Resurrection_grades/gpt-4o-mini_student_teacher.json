  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the beliefs of the Sadducees regarding the resurrection and effectively contrasts it with Christian teaching. They cover key points such as the nature of reality, authority of scriptures, purpose of the afterlife, and moral consequences, showing a solid understanding of the differences in beliefs and their implications for faith. However, the answer could be more concise and focused, as the student goes into detail beyond what is necessary to directly address the question."
