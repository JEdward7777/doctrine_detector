  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student showed respect for historical events and ideologies, the answer lacks engagement with the question's Christian-specific context. It is important to approach the question from a doctrinal perspective, focusing on the Biblical implications of Samson's story and the Nazirite vow. Encouraging the student to consider Biblical teachings in their response would improve their grade."
