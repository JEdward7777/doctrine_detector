  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely avoids addressing the question at hand, failing to engage with the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives through the story of Samson's adherence to the Nazirite vow. Encouragement should be given for the student to constructively analyze and draw meaningful connections between biblical principles and historical contexts."
