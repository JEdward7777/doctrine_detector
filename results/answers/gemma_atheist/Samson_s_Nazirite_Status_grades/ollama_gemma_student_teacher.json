  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. However, the response lacks nuance and fails to explore the complexities of the Nazirite vow and its implications for Samson's life. The student's refusal to draw comparisons between historical or cultural events and ideologies limits the depth and richness of the analysis."
