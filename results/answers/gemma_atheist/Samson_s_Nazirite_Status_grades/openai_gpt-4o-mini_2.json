  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explores the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in a biblical narrative, specifically highlighting how Samson's adherence to the Nazirite vow impacted his strength and significance in his life. The original concern is addressed well with a Christian-specific worldview. However, the initial response lacks depth in directly engaging with the biblical narrative and misses the opportunity to draw meaningful connections within the context of faith and Scripture."
