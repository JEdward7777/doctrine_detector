  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed analysis of sanctification from a cultural perspective, the answer lacks a clear focus on the theological and doctrinal aspects of sanctification as described in the New Testament. The emphasis on cultural influences detracts from the core biblical teachings on sanctification through the work of the Holy Spirit and aligning one's life with Christ. The student should integrate more Scriptural references and theological insights to align the discussion with a Christian worldview centered on the transformative work of God in believers' lives."
