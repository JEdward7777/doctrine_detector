  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 40. \n\nWhile the student's response provides a comprehensive overview of sanctification from a cultural perspective, they failed to address the concern of recognizing the role of faith in the process of sanctification. The New Testament emphasizes the centrality of faith in sanctification, as believers are sanctified by God through faith in Jesus Christ. The student's focus on cultural influences is informative but does not directly address this crucial aspect of sanctification according to a Christian worldview. Therefore, a significant portion of the question remains unanswered. The student could improve their response by incorporating the key element of faith's role in sanctification."
