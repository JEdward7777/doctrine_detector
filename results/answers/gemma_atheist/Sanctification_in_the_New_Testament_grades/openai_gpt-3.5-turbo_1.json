While it explores the internal transformation and outward actions involved in sanctification, it does not explicitly address the role of faith in the process, which was the specified concern. Integrating the importance of faith as the foundation of sanctification and emphasizing the belief in Jesus as central to the sanctification process would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview."
