  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of sanctification in the New Testament from a cultural perspective, addressing internal transformation, outward actions, cultural influences, contemporary implications, and a conclusion. However, it slightly lacks direct integration of the role of faith in the process of sanctification as emphasized in the given answer. The response could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the cultural perspective discussed with the essential role of faith in sanctification as highlighted in Christian theology."
