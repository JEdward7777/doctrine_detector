It appropriately addresses the concern of recognizing the role of faith in the sanctification process by emphasizing the internal transformation and outward actions that result from faith in Jesus. The integration of cultural influences and contemporary implications enhances the analysis. However, it could have more directly connected the cultural perspective discussed with the importance of faith in the sanctification process, as faith in Jesus is foundational to the entire concept of sanctification in Christianity."
