**However, it's important to note:**

- The Bible is a product of its cultural and historical context. Many concepts and ideas within it are rooted in the ancient Near East and may not be directly applicable or relevant to contemporary contexts.
- As an atheist scholar, I approach the Bible critically and without supernatural or religious beliefs. The interpretation and understanding of the term "sanctuary" should be informed by historical, cultural, and literary analyses.
