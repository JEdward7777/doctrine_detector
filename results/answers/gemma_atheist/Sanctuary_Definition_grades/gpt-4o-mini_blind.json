However, the student's statement as an atheist scholar and their approach to the Bible without supernatural or religious beliefs may not align with a Christian worldview, which is essential when discussing biblical terms. It would be more aligned with a Christian worldview if the student had presented the significance of the sanctuary within the biblical narrative and the theological implications of sanctuary as a sacred space where God's presence dwells and where believers can find refuge and communion with Him. The acknowledgment of the scriptural importance and theological depth of the concept of sanctuary is crucial for a more doctrinally correct perspective."
