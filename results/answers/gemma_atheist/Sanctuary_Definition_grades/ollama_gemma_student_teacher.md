## [Answer](../Sanctuary_Definition.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**In the context of the Bible, the term "sanctuary" has multiple meanings:**

**1. Physical sanctuary:**

- A place of refuge or safety from danger or persecution.
- Often refers to a place of worship or religious significance, where individuals could find physical protection and spiritual solace.
- Examples include the Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem.

**2. Spiritual sanctuary:**

- A place of refuge for the soul or mind.
- Represents a state of safety and peace, where one finds solace from anxieties, worries, and sins.
- This sanctuary is often associated with God's love and protection.

**3. Literal sanctuary:**

- A place of storage or refuge for physical objects.
- This is often used in the context of military operations or disaster relief.

**However, it's important to note:**

- The Bible is a product of its cultural and historical context. Many concepts and ideas within it are rooted in the ancient Near East and may not be directly applicable or relevant to contemporary contexts.
- As an atheist scholar, I approach the Bible critically and without supernatural or religious beliefs. The interpretation and understanding of the term "sanctuary" should be informed by historical, cultural, and literary analyses.
