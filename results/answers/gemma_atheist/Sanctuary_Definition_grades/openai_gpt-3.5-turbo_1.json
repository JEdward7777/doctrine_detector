The response also acknowledges the significance of the Tabernacle and Temple as sanctuaries in the Bible. However, the inclusion of the atheist scholar's perspective and the statement on critically approaching the Bible without supernatural beliefs detracts from a Christian-specific worldview, which is important when discussing Biblical concepts. This perspective could potentially undermine the sacredness and divine nature of the sanctuary as presented in the Bible."
