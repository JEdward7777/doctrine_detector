The inclusion of examples like the tabernacle and temple enhances the understanding. However, there is a concern with the atheist scholar's viewpoint dismissing supernatural or religious beliefs, which may hinder a holistic interpretation from a Christian worldview. Consideration of the meaning of sanctuary within the framework of God's presence and divine protection is crucial for a complete understanding from a Christian perspective."
