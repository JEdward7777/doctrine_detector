The Biblical concept of sanctuary extends beyond just physical locations to include spiritual and symbolic meanings, which are important for a comprehensive understanding. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to discuss the theological underpinnings of sanctuary within Christianity, such as its significance in offering redemption and reconciliation with God. Integrating these aspects would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
