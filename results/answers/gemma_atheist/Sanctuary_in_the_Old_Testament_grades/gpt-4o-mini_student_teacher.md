Comment: The student acknowledged the religious context but ultimately did not address the specific concern of recognizing the importance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people in the Old Testament. The response lacked depth and understanding of the Christian perspective on the significance of the sanctuary in relation to God's presence and protection.
