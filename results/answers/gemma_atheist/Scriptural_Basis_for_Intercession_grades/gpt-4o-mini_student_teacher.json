  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided relevant verses and explored the concept of intercession from a diverse perspective, the answer lacked a focus on the specific concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. The verses chosen did not directly address the question asked, as they did not provide clear insights into the practice of interceding for others from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student's approach of considering cultural sensitivity and inclusivity, while important, diverted from the main focus of the question. A stronger emphasis on scriptural guidance for believers in the context of intercessory prayer would have improved the answer."
