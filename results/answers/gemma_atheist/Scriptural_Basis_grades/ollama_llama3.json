  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response does not address the concern of connecting the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding. Instead, it provides an initial disclaimer about its limitations and does not engage with the given answer or concern. To receive a higher grade, the response would need to explicitly connect the provided biblical references (1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26) to the theological concept of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins, providing meaningful insights and analysis."
