75.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1.md)
Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided appropriate biblical references connecting key verses to the theological concept of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins. However, they received a lower grade due to their initial response of being unable to provide theological interpretations, which limited their ability to fully engage with the concern of connecting these concepts. Encouraging them to explore theological interpretations within a Christian worldview would enhance their response.
