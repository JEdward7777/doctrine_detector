  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concept by citing key verses that support the idea of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins. However, the concern was not fully addressed as the response did not provide an in-depth connection between the theological concept and the biblical references for deeper understanding. A stronger integration of the verses with an explanation of how they relate to the concept would have improved the response."
