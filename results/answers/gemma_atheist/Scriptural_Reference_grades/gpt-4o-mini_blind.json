  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-organized list of biblical passages addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers. They have correctly highlighted the tension between believers' identification with the world and their separation from it, emphasizing the importance of being transformed by the Holy Spirit. The student could further improve by delving into the theological implications of these passages and providing deeper insights into how believers are called to interact with the world while maintaining their faith."
