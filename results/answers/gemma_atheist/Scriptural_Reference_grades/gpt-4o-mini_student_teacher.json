  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 90. The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical passages addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers and offered insightful points to consider. The response also included cultural considerations, which demonstrate a holistic understanding of the topic. The student effectively addressed the concern of navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values by emphasizing the believer's call to be transformed by the Holy Spirit and to live lives that are different from the non-believing world. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful response."
