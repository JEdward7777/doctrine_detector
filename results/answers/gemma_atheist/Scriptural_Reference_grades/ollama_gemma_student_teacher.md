## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
## Biblical passages addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers:

**1. Paul's Letters:**

* **Romans 12:2:** "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds."
* **2 Corinthians 5:17:** "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come."
* **Galatians 5:19:** "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control."

**2. Jesus' Teachings:**

* **Matthew 7:24-27:** "Therefore whoever hears these words of mine and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew, and his house stood."
* **John 17:14:** "I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world."

**3. Other passages:**

* **Psalm 1:1-2:** "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the path of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditate day and night."
* **1 John 2:15:** "Do not love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
