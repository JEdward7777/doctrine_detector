  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by providing key biblical passages that discuss how believers should view and interact with the world characterized by ungodly values. The additional details on the tension between believers and the world, the call to be transformed by the Holy Spirit, and the ultimate goal of glorifying God enrich the answer. The references to cultural considerations also add depth to the response. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful explanation from a Christian worldview."
