## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides relevant Bible passages that can be used to deepen understanding of scripture related to judgment, which aligns with the concern. However, since the initial response emphasizes neutrality and fact-based information, it doesn't fully engage with the scriptural basis for beliefs as intended. To improve this grade, the response could explore how these biblical passages relate to the concern, providing a more integrated and meaningful connection between the two.
