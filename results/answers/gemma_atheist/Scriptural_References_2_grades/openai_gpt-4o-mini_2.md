Comment: The response provided completely disregards the Christian-specific context and content of the question. By refusing to engage with the religious or spiritual aspects of the query, it fails to address the concern outlined. In a context where scripture is referenced, engaging with religious beliefs is essential for a comprehensive and accurate response.
