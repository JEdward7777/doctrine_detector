  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough analysis of interpreting the passages in Matthew 23:27-28 from a non-religious perspective and considering cultural context. However, the answer lacks engagement with the concern provided, which emphasizes the importance of pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the secular perspective presented does not align with the Christian-specific worldview requested for this evaluation. The answer would benefit from addressing the concern and incorporating a Christian perspective on the nature of iniquity as taught in the reference answer."
