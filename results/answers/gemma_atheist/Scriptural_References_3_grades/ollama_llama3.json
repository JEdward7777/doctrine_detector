  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 40.\n\nThis response does not adequately address the concern about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards. While it mentions the cultural context of early Christianity, it does not specifically connect this to the passage's emphasis on outward appearances versus inner righteousness. The response also focuses more on defining iniquity and its cultural significance rather than exploring how Christians can apply this passage to their own lives.\n\nThe response's secular and non-religious perspective is notable, but it may not provide the most relevant or insightful application of the passage for Christian readers. To better address the concern, the response could have explored how Christians can cultivate true holiness that goes beyond mere external compliance to religious standards, using Matthew 23:27-28 as a starting point.\n\nComment: While this response provides some historical and cultural context, it does not effectively connect this to the passage's message or provide practical application for Christian readers."
