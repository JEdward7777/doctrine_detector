  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the biblical references to birthright and effectively considers the cultural context and limitations of interpretation. It also addresses the concern regarding scripture interpretation and its relevance to contemporary Christian life. The response could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the value of birthright in God's plan, holiness, and spiritual inheritance with the broader themes discussed in the biblical passages analyzed."
