  "grade_comment": "Grade: 82\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the Biblical references to birthright, considering their cultural context and the limitations of interpreting ancient texts. It appropriately addresses the concern about scripture interpretation and its relevance to contemporary Christian life. However, the response could have further emphasized the spiritual and theological implications of birthright in God's plan as discussed in the provided answer. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
