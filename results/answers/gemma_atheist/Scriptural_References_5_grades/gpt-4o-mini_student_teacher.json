  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of key New Testament verses indicating a shift in the understanding of Hades towards being associated with the unrighteous. They demonstrated a good understanding of the implications for Christian eschatology and acknowledged the importance of interpreting these verses within their cultural contexts. However, the student missed out on referencing the key verses highlighted in the teacher's answer, specifically Luke 16:23 and Luke 23:43, which are crucial in illustrating the shift in understanding of Hades. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in referencing the core verses."
