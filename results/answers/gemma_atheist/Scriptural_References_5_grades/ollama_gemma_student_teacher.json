  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the shift in understanding Hades from a neutral place to one associated with the unrighteous. The student provides relevant New Testament verses to support their claim and acknowledges the cultural and literary contexts of these verses. However, the student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on the theological implications of these shifts in understanding. Additionally, the student could have mentioned other relevant New Testament passages that address the nature of Hades."
