  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The answer lacks a Christian worldview perspective and fails to engage with the concept of exaltation as understood in Christian faith. The response dismisses the passages based on atheistic reasoning, disregarding the doctrinal significance of exaltation in Christianity. It also overlooks the theological depth and spiritual truths conveyed in the verses provided. The answer would benefit from a more thoughtful examination of the biblical texts within a Christian framework."
