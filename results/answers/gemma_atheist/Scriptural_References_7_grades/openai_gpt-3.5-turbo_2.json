However, the perspective presented is heavily rooted in atheistic beliefs and lacks a deeper exploration of the Christian worldview regarding humility and exaltation. Additionally, the emphasis on cultural and scientific perspectives detracts from a thorough analysis from a Christian-specific standpoint. More focus on connecting biblical principles to the Christian perspective on humility and exaltation would have strengthened the response."
