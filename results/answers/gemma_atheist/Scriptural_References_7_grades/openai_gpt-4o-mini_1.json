The evaluation of cultural influences and scientific perspectives adds depth to the discussion. However, the concern given was to connect biblical principles of humility and exaltation in the life of believers, and the response falls short in addressing this aspect effectively. The response would benefit from incorporating how believers apply these principles in their lives and the significance of exaltation in the Christian faith for individuals."
