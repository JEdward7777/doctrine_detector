  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful response, incorporating relevant scriptural references and explaining how they can guide a Christian's life towards blamelessness. The student's answer also covers a broad range of guiding principles for a Christian's life, aligning well with the Christian worldview. However, the student missed key references such as 1 Thessalonians 2:10, 2 Peter 3:14, and Philippians 2:15, which were highlighted by the teacher. Integrating these additional references could have further enhanced the depth of the response."
