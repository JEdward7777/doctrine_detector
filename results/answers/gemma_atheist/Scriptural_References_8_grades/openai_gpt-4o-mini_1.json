The inclusion of key references such as 1 Thessalonians 2:10, 2 Peter 3:14, and Philippians 2:15 is commendable as they emphasize integrity, obedience, and turning away from evil. The response effectively addresses the concern by aligning the content with the focus on living a life pleasing to God and maintaining a blameless character from a Christian worldview."
