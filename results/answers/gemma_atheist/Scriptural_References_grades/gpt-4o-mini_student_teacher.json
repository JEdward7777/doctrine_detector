  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student correctly identified the book of Genesis as containing the reference to God as \"Almighty\" in relation to Abraham, which aligns with the teacher's reference. However, the student could have provided the specific verse reference (Genesis 17:1) for a more precise answer. Overall, good demonstration of biblical knowledge."
