  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge that the reference to God as \"Almighty\" can be found in the book of Genesis, it doesn't specifically identify the correct chapter and verse (Genesis 17:1). This falls short of providing accurate information about the biblical reference.\n\nHowever, I do appreciate the fact that the response recognizes the importance of knowing biblical references in deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises, which aligns with the concern. If the response had provided the correct answer, it would have earned a higher grade.\n\nComment: While this response shows some effort to engage with the concern, it could benefit from more attention to detail and accuracy when providing scriptural references."
