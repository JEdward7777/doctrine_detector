  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough response by citing relevant Bible verses emphasizing restoration and providing insightful interpretations for each. They also effectively illustrated the key aspects of restoration found in the verses. However, the student missed referencing the specific verses Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6 from the teacher's answer, which would have enriched their response and provided a more comprehensive perspective on the theme of restoration in the faith journey."
