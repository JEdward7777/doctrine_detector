  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of biblical verses that emphasize restoration, including interpretation and illustration points. It covers various aspects of restoration such as renewal, healing, reconciliation, cosmic transformation, and hope. While it does not directly address the concern about finding scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey, it offers relevant biblical evidence that can be applied to this concept.\n\nThe only deduction from a perfect score is due to the fact that the response does not explicitly connect the provided verses to the concept of restoration in one's faith journey. However, the inclusion of these verses and their interpretations provides a solid foundation for exploring this concept further."
