They also thoughtfully considered the cultural influences surrounding this concept and its implications for believers. The response is well-organized, clearly articulated, and demonstrates insightful theological reflection. However, it would benefit from more explicit engagement with the provided concern regarding spiritual vigilance and integrity in the believer's life."
