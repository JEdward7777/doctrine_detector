  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student's answer provides a detailed analysis of the interpretive approaches to understanding Jesus' statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds and offers some implications for believers. However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. The emphasis on cultural relativism and symbolic/metaphorical interpretations without addressing the foundational belief in the literal return of Jesus Christ as taught in Christian doctrine lowers the grade significantly. It is essential to uphold the core tenets of Christian faith when discussing biblical prophecies. Encouraging further integration of doctrinal viewpoints would improve the theological accuracy of the response."
