However, there is a lack of emphasis on the core Christian belief that Jesus' return as the 'Son of Man' signifies His role as the Messiah and the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises. The response could have given more weight to the central Christian hope and eschatological significance of Jesus' second coming."
