  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-supported exploration of Jesus' statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds from a symbolic and culturally nuanced perspective. It effectively considers interpretive approaches, implications for believers, and cultural considerations. The response acknowledges the importance of understanding the historical-cultural context and symbolic nature of Jesus' words. Furthermore, it appropriately addresses the implications for believers, emphasizing hope, moral transformation, and community. The response could be strengthened by directly connecting the content with the concern of Christian hope and eschatology more explicitly and systematically throughout the analysis."
