## [Answer](../Separation_from_Gentiles.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The Pharisees' concern about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles stemmed from their interpretation of Jewish law and their understanding of the role of the Jewish people in history. 

**Their primary concerns were:**

**1. Maintaining religious purity:**

* The Pharisees believed that maintaining strict separation between Judaism and non-Jewish practices and beliefs was essential to preserving the sanctity of Judaism and preventing contamination.
* They feared that contact with Gentiles could lead to interfaith marriage, dietary violations, and the erosion of Jewish customs and beliefs.

**2. Political and social separation:**

* The Pharisees envisioned a divinely ordained separation between Judaism and non- Judaism as a way of preserving Jewish political and social autonomy.
* They feared that integration with Gentiles would lead to the loss of Jewish political power and the erosion of their unique cultural and social identity.

**3. Anticipating Roman persecution:**

* The Pharisees believed that their separation from the Gentiles would make it easier for them to withstand potential Roman persecution.
* They feared that if the Jewish people were seen as indistinguishable from the Gentiles, they would be targeted as a political and religious threat.

**4. Preparing for the Messianic Age:**

* The Pharisees believed that God's ultimate plan was to restore Israel and establish a Messianic Age.
* They saw separation as a necessary step in preparing the Jewish people for their eventual reunion with God in the afterlife.
