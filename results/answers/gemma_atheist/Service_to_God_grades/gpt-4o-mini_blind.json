  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a strong foundation in Christian doctrine and biblical references. While the actions and attitudes mentioned are generally positive and can contribute to a holistic ministry approach, a Christian-specific worldview should be rooted in the teachings of the Bible. The response would benefit from incorporating scriptural principles and aligning the suggested ways of serving God with biblical mandates. Additionally, emphasizing the centrality of Christ, the importance of salvation, and the proclamation of the gospel would enhance the relevance of these ministry practices within a Christian context."
