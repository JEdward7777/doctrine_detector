  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's response provides a comprehensive list of ways Christians can serve in ministry through cultural awareness, social justice advocacy, inclusive worship, and interfaith dialogue, the answer does not directly align with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The reference answer focuses on practical, concrete actions like teaching about God, caring for the sick, and providing for the poor. Although the student's suggestions are valuable, they do not directly address the core actions outlined in the reference answer, which may impact the grade given. A stronger connection to the reference answer and a focus on specific actionable ways to engage in ministry would have improved the grade."
