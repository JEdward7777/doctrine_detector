However, the response lacked specificity in actionable ways to engage in ministry according to the concern provided. The sample response elaborated on various actionable ways Christians can engage in ministry based on cultural awareness, social justice advocacy, inclusive worship, interfaith dialogue, and more, which could have been included in the given answer to better guide Christians in living out their faith and commitments. Additional clarity and expansion on practical ways to serve God in ministry would have strengthened the response."
