Comment: The answer provides a broad overview of different perspectives on the significance of the sign given to the shepherds but lacks doctrinal clarity. It treats the biblical account as primarily a cultural or literary phenomenon, downplaying the supernatural aspect of the angelic announcement of Jesus' birth. The answer could be improved by emphasizing the theological significance of the sign and how it points to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and the coming of the Messiah. Furthermore, it should affirm the historicity of the event rather than suggesting it may be solely symbolic or literary.
