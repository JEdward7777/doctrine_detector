  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer strays far from the Christian specific worldview by overly focusing on cultural and historical interpretations while neglecting the core Christian belief in the fulfillment of prophecies through signs. The answer misses the central message of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke, which was to announce the birth of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, rather than being a mere cultural or literary device. The response lacks a solid theological understanding and fails to recognize the significance of the sign in the broader context of God's plan of salvation."
