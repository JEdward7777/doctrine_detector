However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern of recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs. The response focuses more on diverse interpretations and cultural biases rather than emphasizing the theological significance of the sign in light of Biblical prophecy and divine intervention. The analysis could be improved by integrating a stronger Christian worldview perspective that emphasizes the Messianic fulfillment and the prophetic significance of the sign given to the shepherds."
