However, the response did not directly address the concern about recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs. The focus was more on the complexity and interpretation of the sign rather than its specific significance in relation to fulfilling prophecies and God's plan. Engaging more directly with the concern and providing a clearer connection to the given answer would have strengthened the response."
