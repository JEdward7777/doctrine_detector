However, it failed to align with the specified concern of recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs. The response did not address the specific Christian worldview that the sign of the baby in a manger was a fulfillment of prophecies and a part of God's larger plan for salvation. It viewed the event through a primarily secular lens, missing the Christian interpretation of the sign's significance."
