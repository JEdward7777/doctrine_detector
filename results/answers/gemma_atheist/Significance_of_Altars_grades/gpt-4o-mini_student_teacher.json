However, the answer tends to focus more on the symbolic, ritual, and cultural aspects of altars rather than specifically addressing the significance in terms of sacrifice and devotion, which is the key concern outlined by the teacher. The answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of altars as a place for making offerings to God as an act of devotion and atonement."
