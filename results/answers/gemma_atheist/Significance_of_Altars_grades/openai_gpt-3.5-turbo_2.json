However, it lacks depth in exploring the broader significance and symbolism of altars in biblical worship, such as covenant mediation, access to the divine presence, ritual purity, national identity, and cosmic order. Therefore, the response could be improved by incorporating these aspects to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the importance of altars in biblical worship from a Christian perspective."
