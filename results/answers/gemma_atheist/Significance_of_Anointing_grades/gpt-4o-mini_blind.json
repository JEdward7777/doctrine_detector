  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-organized explanation of the significance of anointing in the context of Old Testament priests, kings, and prophets. The answer effectively covers the symbolic representation of purity and holiness, divine mandate and authority, covenant relationship, ritual purity and transformation, leadership qualities, cultural context and symbolism, continuity and succession, and the symbolic connection to the spiritual realm. The connections made between anointing and various aspects of leadership and spiritual significance are insightful and demonstrate a good understanding of the topic. Some additional references to specific Old Testament passages where anointing took place could further strengthen the answer. Overall, well done."
