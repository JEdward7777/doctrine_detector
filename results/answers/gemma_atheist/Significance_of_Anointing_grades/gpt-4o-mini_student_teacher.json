  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough and well-organized explanation of the significance of anointing in the context of Old Testament priests, kings, and prophets. The response covers various aspects such as symbolic representation, divine mandate, covenant relationship, ritual purity, leadership qualities, cultural context, continuity and succession, and symbolic connection to the spiritual realm. The student effectively connects anointing to the empowerment by God for their roles. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on the central theme of empowerment by God, as highlighted in the reference answer, to receive a higher grade."
