  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided insightful perspectives on the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name, touching on cultural context, theological ambiguity, respect for diverse traditions, avoiding idolatry, and focusing on essence. While their points are valid and well-explained, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly connecting these aspects to deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect within the Christian faith. This connection is crucial for a more focused and effective analysis from a Christian worldview."
