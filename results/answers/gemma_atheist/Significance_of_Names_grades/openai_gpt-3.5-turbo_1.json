  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name, emphasizing God's attributes and strength. It also considers important aspects like cultural context, theological ambiguity, respect for diverse traditions, avoiding idolatry, and focusing on the essence of God. It effectively addresses the concern of deepening understanding of God's character and relational aspect within the Christian faith. However, it could have strengthened its argument by explicitly connecting the translation choice to how it enhances the Christian understanding of God's character and relational aspect."
