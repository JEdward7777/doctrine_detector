# Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

# Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

# Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

# Answer by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
## Significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name:

**1. Cultural context:**

* In ancient Hebrew culture, titles like "Shaddai" were primarily used for deities and held immense respect. Translating it as a mere name would erase this cultural significance.
* Translating it as a title aligns with the historical understanding of the word within its cultural and linguistic context.

**2. Theological ambiguity:**

* The precise meaning and nature of "Shaddai" remain debated among scholars. 
* Translating it as a name would impose a singular interpretation, potentially misleading readers.
* This ambiguity reflects the deliberate ambiguity in the biblical text, leaving space for diverse interpretations.

**3. Respect for diverse traditions:**

* Different religious and cultural traditions interpret "Shaddai" differently. 
* Translating it as a title avoids imposing a specific interpretation favored by one tradition over another.
* This approach shows respect for the diverse interpretations of the text held by different communities.

**4. Avoiding idolatry:**

* Literal translation of "Shaddai" as a name could inadvertently promote the idea of deity-worship. 
* Translating it as a title emphasizes its symbolic and metaphorical significance, rather than suggesting an actual physical presence.

**5. Focus on the essence:**

* Ultimately, the essence of "Shaddai" lies in its qualities and attributes, not in a literal name. 
* Translating it as a title directs attention towards the character and nature of the divine, rather than on a specific name.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the significance of translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name, emphasizing God's attributes and strength. It also considers important aspects like cultural context, theological ambiguity, respect for diverse traditions, avoiding idolatry, and focusing on the essence of God. It effectively addresses the concern of deepening understanding of God's character and relational aspect within the Christian faith. However, it could have strengthened its argument by explicitly connecting the translation choice to how it enhances the Christian understanding of God's character and relational aspect.
