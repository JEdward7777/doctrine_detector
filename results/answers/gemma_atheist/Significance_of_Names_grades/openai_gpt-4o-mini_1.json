However, while it acknowledges the importance of God's attributes, it falls short in directly addressing the relational aspect with God that is essential in the Christian faith. The response could have integrated more explicitly how the use of 'Shaddai' as a title enhances the understanding and deepening of God's character in the context of a personal relationship with believers."
