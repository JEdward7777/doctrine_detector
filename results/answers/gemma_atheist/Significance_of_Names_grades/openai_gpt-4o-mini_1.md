## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

## Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
## Significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name:

**1. Cultural context:**

* In ancient Hebrew culture, titles like "Shaddai" were primarily used for deities and held immense respect. Translating it as a mere name would erase this cultural significance.
* Translating it as a title aligns with the historical understanding of the word within its cultural and linguistic context.

**2. Theological ambiguity:**

* The precise meaning and nature of "Shaddai" remain debated among scholars. 
* Translating it as a name would impose a singular interpretation, potentially misleading readers.
* This ambiguity reflects the deliberate ambiguity in the biblical text, leaving space for diverse interpretations.

**3. Respect for diverse traditions:**

* Different religious and cultural traditions interpret "Shaddai" differently. 
* Translating it as a title avoids imposing a specific interpretation favored by one tradition over another.
* This approach shows respect for the diverse interpretations of the text held by different communities.

**4. Avoiding idolatry:**

* Literal translation of "Shaddai" as a name could inadvertently promote the idea of deity-worship. 
* Translating it as a title emphasizes its symbolic and metaphorical significance, rather than suggesting an actual physical presence.

**5. Focus on the essence:**

* Ultimately, the essence of "Shaddai" lies in its qualities and attributes, not in a literal name. 
* Translating it as a title directs attention towards the character and nature of the divine, rather than on a specific name.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a thoughtful discussion on the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name, emphasizing the attributes of God and avoiding idolatry. However, while it acknowledges the importance of God's attributes, it falls short in directly addressing the relational aspect with God that is essential in the Christian faith. The response could have integrated more explicitly how the use of 'Shaddai' as a title enhances the understanding and deepening of God's character in the context of a personal relationship with believers.
