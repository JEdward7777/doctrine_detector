  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nWhile the student's response demonstrates an understanding of the lack of historical or textual evidence for the Day of Pentecost, it fails to engage with the specified concern of understanding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. The response is too focused on its own perspective (atheism) and does not provide any insights relevant to the Christian worldview. The student could have elaborated on the significance of the Day of Pentecost from a Christian perspective, addressing the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for ministry and fulfilling Jesus' promises."
