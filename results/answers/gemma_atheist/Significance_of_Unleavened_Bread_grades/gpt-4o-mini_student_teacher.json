  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer, exploring various aspects of the symbolism of unleavened bread in relation to sin and living a life that honors God. They effectively connected the concept to purity, simplicity, humility, spiritual growth, connection to the divine, and transformation. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more closely on the central theme of the removal of sin and the importance of living in a way that honors God, as emphasized in the reference answer."
