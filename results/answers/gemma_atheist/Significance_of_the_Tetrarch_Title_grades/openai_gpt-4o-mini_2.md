## [Answer](../Significance_of_the_Tetrarch_Title.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The title 'tetrarch' reveals that during the time of Jesus, the Roman Empire was divided into four administrative regions, each governed by a 'tetrarch'. This governance structure was established by Emperor Diocletian in 284 AD as a way to increase efficiency and control in the vast Roman Empire.

The tetrarchy system comprised four positions:

* **Emperor of the East:** Based in Byzantium, responsible for the eastern half of the empire.
* **Emperor of the West:** Based in Rome, responsible for the western half of the empire.
* **Caesar of the East:** Co-ruler of the Eastern Empire, reporting to the Emperor of the East.
* **Caesar of the West:** Co-ruler of the Western Empire, reporting to the Emperor of the West.

The tetrarchy system remained in place until the empire's split into the Eastern and Western Roman Empires in 395 AD.

However, integrating how this specific political structure influenced the events surrounding Jesus' life from a Christian worldview perspective could further enhance the response.
