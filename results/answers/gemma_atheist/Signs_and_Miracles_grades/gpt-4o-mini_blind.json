It approaches the topic solely from a secular, atheistic perspective without acknowledging the foundation of faith upon which Christianity is built. From a doctrinal standpoint, it fails to engage with the belief that signs and miracles were integral in confirming the authority of Jesus and the apostles as messengers of God. The response also neglects the spiritual aspect of these miraculous events and their role in pointing people towards faith in God."
