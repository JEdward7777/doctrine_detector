  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student's response does not align with a Christian worldview that views signs and miracles as demonstrations of God's power and authority. The focus on skepticism, naturalistic explanations, and dismissal of the role of faith in understanding divine intervention does not reflect the foundational beliefs of Christianity. The student's perspective lacks an appreciation for the spiritual dimensions of signs and miracles as avenues of God's revelation to humanity."
