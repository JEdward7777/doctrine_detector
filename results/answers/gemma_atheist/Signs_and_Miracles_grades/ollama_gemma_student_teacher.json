  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive and well-researched analysis of various arguments against the efficacy of signs and miracles as proof of the Christian message.\n* Articulate presentation of cultural bias, lack of independent verification, and the selective interpretation of miracles throughout history.\n* Acknowledgement of the impact of historical and archaeological findings, psychological theories, and ethical concerns in understanding early Christianity.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The conclusion does not explicitly engage with the teacher's reference answer, which focuses on the validation of God's power and authority through signs and miracles.\n* While the student expresses skepticism about the role of signs and miracles in proving the veracity of the Christian message, the answer lacks a clear and definitive rejection of their significance.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could strengthen their position by providing additional examples of selective interpretations and discarded miracles throughout Christian history.\n* A more explicit engagement with the teacher's reference answer would be beneficial, exploring how the student's arguments relate to the validation of God's power and authority through signs and miracles."
