  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided lacks an understanding of the Christian worldview. It dismisses the significance of signs and miracles in validating God's power and authority, which are fundamental aspects of faith for Christians. From a Christian perspective, signs and miracles are not merely cultural biases or psychological phenomena but manifestations of God's revelation to humanity. The response does not engage with the specific concern raised regarding the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation in a Christian context. Therefore, the grade is low as the response does not align with a Christian worldview."
