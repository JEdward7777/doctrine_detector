  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response drastically undermines the Christian perspective on signs and miracles by heavily focusing on naturalistic explanations and skepticism towards supernatural events. It fails to acknowledge the significance of signs and miracles as divine validations of God's power and authority in validating His revelation through Jesus and the apostles. It dismisses the crucial role of faith in recognizing the truth of God's message, which is foundational in Christian belief. The response lacks an understanding of the intrinsic relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation from a Christian worldview."
