  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided takes a very critical and skeptical view of signs and miracles in relation to establishing the truth of God's message. The response does not acknowledge or engage with the Christian worldview, which sees signs and miracles as manifestations of God's power and authority to confirm the validity of His message. From a Christian perspective, signs and miracles are not merely cultural or psychological phenomena but are divine interventions that point to the reality of God and His revelation. The response fails to address the core concern of the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation from a Christian worldview."
