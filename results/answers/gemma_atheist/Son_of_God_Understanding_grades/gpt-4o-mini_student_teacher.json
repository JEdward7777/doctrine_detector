  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive overview of the term \"Son of God\" in different contexts, including cultural, biblical interpretation, and ethical considerations. They touch on the divine nature of Jesus and His relationship with God the Father. However, the answer lacks a clear and explicit affirmation of the Christian belief that Jesus is fully God and shares the same nature as God the Father. This key point, central to understanding the divinity of Jesus, could have been emphasized more directly in the response."
