  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the theological significance of the term \"Son of God\" in Christianity. \n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of the term's meaning in both biblical and theological contexts, highlighting Jesus' divine nature and filial relationship with God the Father. \n\nThe student also acknowledges the cultural and historical influences on the concept and offers possible interpretations of the term. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the biblical basis for the claim that Jesus is fully God, such as references to relevant scriptures."
