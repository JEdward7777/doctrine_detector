  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the distinction between \"Son of God\" and \"Sons of God\" by considering etymology, theological implications, cultural significance, rhetorical differences, and theological controversy. They accurately highlight the unique divine nature and lineage of Jesus as \"Son of God\" and the broader spiritual kinship of believers as \"Sons of God.\" However, the answer could be improved by clearly stating that 'Son of God' refers specifically to Jesus as God's only Son, which is the key distinction emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic, but could benefit from a more precise focus on the key point of differentiation."
