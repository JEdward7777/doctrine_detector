**Distinction between "Son of God" and "Sons of God":**

**1. Etymology and Cultural Context:**

* "Sons of God" is a plural term that refers to any descendant of God, including believers.

**2. Theological Implications:**

* "Son of God" implies a unique divine nature and lineage for Jesus, suggesting he is the only begotten Son of God.

**3. Cultural Significance:**

* "Sons of God" is a more general term that aligns with the concept of believers as God's children.

**4. Rhetorical Difference:**

**5. Theological Controversy:**

* The interpretation and implications of "Son of God" have been debated within Christianity, with some scholars arguing for a non-literal or symbolic understanding.
