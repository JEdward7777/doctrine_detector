  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-explained distinction between \"Son of God\" and \"Sons of God\" based on etymology, theological implications, cultural significance, rhetorical differences, and theological controversy. It effectively clarifies the distinction, addressing the concern of avoiding confusion in theological discussions. The response could be slightly improved with more direct reference to the specific answer provided, but overall it is well-structured and informative."
