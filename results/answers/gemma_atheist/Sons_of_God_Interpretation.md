## Interpretations of "Sons of God" in Genesis 6:

* This interpretation faces significant scientific and historical challenges.


**2. Angelic Interpretation:**

* This interpretation interprets the "sons of God" as fallen angels who descended to Earth and engaged in sexual relations with human women.
* This interpretation finds support in other biblical passages like Ezekiel 32:2 and 1 Enoch.
* However, it lacks mainstream scientific or historical backing.

* This interpretation aligns with modern scientific understanding of genetics and human origins.


**4. Cultural Interpretation:**

* This interpretation views the "sons of God" as metaphors or cultural symbols representing human wickedness or depravity.
* This aligns with the broader narrative of Genesis 6, where humanity is depicted as corrupt and in need of divine intervention.


**5. Ethical Interpretation:**

* It suggests that the "sons of God" represent reckless or unholy actions that bring harm to the natural world or violate spiritual laws.
