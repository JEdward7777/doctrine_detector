However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is crucial to address doctrinal implications more explicitly. The answer should have emphasized the importance of staying within the boundaries of orthodox Christian beliefs, particularly regarding the nature of angels, fallen angels, and the implications of the events described in Genesis 6. A stronger connection to biblical theology and doctrinal considerations would have enhanced the answer."
