  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, considering literal, angelic, genetic, cultural, and ethical perspectives. They also appropriately highlighted factors to consider in biblical interpretation. However, their answer did not directly align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which suggested that the term may refer to fallen angels, powerful political rulers, or the descendants of Seth. Despite this discrepancy, the student demonstrated a good understanding of various interpretations and presented their arguments cohesively."
