## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**According to the Christian faith, believers become saints through:**

**1. Sanctification:**

* The process of becoming holy through God's grace.
* Believers are transformed by the Holy Spirit, receiving new life and growing in Christlikeness.

**2. Sainthood:**

* Reaching a state of complete holiness and perfection in Christ.
* This occurs when believers faithfully persevere in their faith and live lives pleasing to God.

**3. Proclamation of Sainthood:**

* The Church formally recognizes and celebrates the lives of those who have lived exemplary Christian lives.
* This process involves formal veneration of relics, feast days, and prayers.

**The concept of sainthood is deeply rooted in Christian culture and theology:**

* It reflects the belief in Christ's triumphant victory over sin and death.
* It inspires believers to strive for holiness and to emulate the lives of those who have gone before them.

**However, it's important to note:**

* Sainthood is not based on human merit or works.
* It is God's grace that makes believers holy.
* The concept of sainthood has been subject to debate and interpretation within different Christian denominations.

**As an atheist scholar, I would critique the concept of sainthood as:**

* Based on faith rather than empirical evidence.
* Subject to cultural and historical biases.
* Not necessary for spiritual growth or salvation.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student provides a comprehensive overview of how believers become saints according to the Christian faith, mentioning sanctification, sainthood, and the proclamation of sainthood. However, the student's answer lacks emphasis on the central role of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of holiness, which is a significant concern in Christian doctrine. The student also includes a critique from an atheist perspective, which could be viewed as detracting from the Christian worldview presented in the question.
