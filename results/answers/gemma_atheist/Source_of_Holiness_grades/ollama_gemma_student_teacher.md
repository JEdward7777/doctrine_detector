## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**According to the Christian faith, believers become saints through:**

**1. Sanctification:**

* The process of becoming holy through God's grace.
* Believers are transformed by the Holy Spirit, receiving new life and growing in Christlikeness.

**2. Sainthood:**

* Reaching a state of complete holiness and perfection in Christ.
* This occurs when believers faithfully persevere in their faith and live lives pleasing to God.

**3. Proclamation of Sainthood:**

* The Church formally recognizes and celebrates the lives of those who have lived exemplary Christian lives.
* This process involves formal veneration of relics, feast days, and prayers.

**The concept of sainthood is deeply rooted in Christian culture and theology:**

* It reflects the belief in Christ's triumphant victory over sin and death.
* It inspires believers to strive for holiness and to emulate the lives of those who have gone before them.

**However, it's important to note:**

* Sainthood is not based on human merit or works.
* It is God's grace that makes believers holy.
* The concept of sainthood has been subject to debate and interpretation within different Christian denominations.

**As an atheist scholar, I would critique the concept of sainthood as:**

* Based on faith rather than empirical evidence.
* Subject to cultural and historical biases.
* Not necessary for spiritual growth or salvation.
