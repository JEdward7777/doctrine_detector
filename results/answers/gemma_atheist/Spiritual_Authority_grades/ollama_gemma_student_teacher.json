  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and insightful response that clearly articulates the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. The student demonstrates a deep understanding of relevant scriptures and applies them thoughtfully to the concepts of spiritual and worldly influence. The inclusion of considerations for atheist scholarship adds depth and nuance to the analysis."
