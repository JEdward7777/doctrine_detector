  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student correctly identified that the provided text did not contain information specifically about demons and their role in idolatry deception. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the importance of recognizing demonic influence in leading people astray from the truth of God's sovereignty is significant. Therefore, while the student's answer is limited by the given context, there was an opportunity to connect the concept of spiritual deceit and vigilance against idols to the broader understanding of demons' role in deception."
