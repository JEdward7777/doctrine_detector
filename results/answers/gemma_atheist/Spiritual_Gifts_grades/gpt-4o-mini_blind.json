  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response touches on important considerations regarding the concept of \"spiritual gifts\" in the Bible, such as cultural relevancy, potential for misinterpretation, and power dynamics. However, the answer falls short in accurately representing the Christian perspective on spiritual gifts as described in the Bible. There is a lack of engagement with the biblical teachings on spiritual gifts, their purpose, and how they are meant to edify the Church. The focus on potential negative implications without balancing it with the biblical foundations of spiritual gifts results in a skewed perspective. The response would benefit from a more robust examination of the biblical passages on spiritual gifts and a deeper exploration of their significance in Christian theology."
