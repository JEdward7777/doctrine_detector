  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed analysis of various concerns related to the phrase \"spiritual gifts\" in the Bible; however, their response lacks a foundational understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic. The answer does not reflect the biblical teaching that spiritual gifts are bestowed by the Holy Spirit for the edification of the church and the service of others in love. To improve their grade, the student should incorporate the biblical perspective on spiritual gifts while addressing their concerns."
