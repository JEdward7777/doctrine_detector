  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of spiritual gifts in the Bible, particularly in terms of their purpose and significance for building up the church and serving others. The author's emphasis on the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit aligns well with the concern provided.\n\nHowever, I deduct some points because the response does not engage deeply enough with the potential implications or challenges associated with the concept of spiritual gifts. While it acknowledges the cultural and historical context in which these gifts were described, it does not critically examine how this concept might be applied (or misapplied) in modern-day contexts.\n\nAdditionally, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the concept of spiritual gifts and the values of humanism and social justice mentioned in the concern. While the author touches on the importance of using these gifts for serving others, a more explicit exploration of how this concept can be used to promote social responsibility would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, I would encourage the author to consider more critically the implications of the phrase \"spiritual gifts\" and to explore more explicitly the connections between this concept and values of humanism and social justice."
