However, it falls short of addressing the concern of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. While it addresses potential harm and misinterpretations, it neglects to acknowledge the positive impact and importance of spiritual gifts within the Christian community. The response could benefit from a more balanced approach that integrates the value and significance of spiritual gifts in accordance with Biblical teachings."
