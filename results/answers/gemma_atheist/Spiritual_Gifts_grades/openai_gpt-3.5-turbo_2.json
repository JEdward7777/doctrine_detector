However, it dismisses the traditional Christian understanding of spiritual gifts as special abilities given by the Holy Spirit for the edification of the church. The response could benefit from a more balanced approach that acknowledges the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit within a Christian worldview."
