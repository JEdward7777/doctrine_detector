**1. Cultural Relevancy:**

* The concept of "spiritual gifts" is deeply embedded in the cultural and religious framework of first-century Judea. 
* Applying these concepts to modern-day society requires careful consideration of the historical and cultural contexts in which they were written.

**2. Problem with Literal Interpretation:**

* The Bible describes various "spiritual gifts" like prophecy, healing, and speaking in tongues. 
* Literal interpretations of these gifts can lead to unrealistic expectations and harmful practices in contemporary society.

Comment: While the response does acknowledge the importance of spiritual gifts as special abilities given by the Holy Spirit for the purpose of building up the church, it falls short in addressing the concern of utilizing these gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. It focuses more on cautioning against literal interpretations, potential harm, and cultural contexts. The response could have provided more guidance on how to effectively use spiritual gifts in accordance with biblical principles and the guidance of the Holy Spirit for community growth.
