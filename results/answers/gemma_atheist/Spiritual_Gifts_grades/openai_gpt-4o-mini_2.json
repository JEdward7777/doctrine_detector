The response fails to acknowledge the foundational importance of spiritual gifts in Christian theology and minimizes their significance in personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. A more balanced approach that integrates biblical teachings on spiritual gifts with the need for discernment and responsible use would have been more appropriate from a Christian worldview."
