**The premise of the question is inaccurate.**

There is no evidence to support the claim that confessing sins to one another contributes to spiritual healing, as mentioned in James 5:16. The passage in James is referring to the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness within the context of community, not to a spiritual healing process.
