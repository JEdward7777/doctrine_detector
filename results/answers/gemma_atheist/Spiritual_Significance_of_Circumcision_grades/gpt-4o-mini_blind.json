The answer effectively captures the depth of spiritual transformation symbolized by this term, drawing from biblical references and highlighting key theological implications. The emphasis on the removal of sinfulness, new birth, and radical transformation aligns with Christian doctrine. Additionally, the student connects the concept to practical implications for believers' lives, such as repentance, submission to God, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response. Great job!"
