  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the symbolism behind the phrase 'circumcision of the heart' in a Christian context. The student effectively highlights the themes of removal of sinfulness, new birth, and radical transformation associated with this concept. However, the answer could have been improved by directly linking these aspects to the purification of the heart through faith in Jesus Christ, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the spiritual implications of this concept in modern Christianity."
