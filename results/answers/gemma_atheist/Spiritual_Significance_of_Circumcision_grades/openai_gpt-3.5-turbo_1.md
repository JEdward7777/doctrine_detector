# Answer by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**In a Christian context, the phrase 'circumcision of the heart' symbolizes a radical transformation of the innermost thoughts, attitudes, and motivations.**

The concept originates from the New Testament (Romans 2:29), where Paul compares the circumcision of the heart to the outward ritual circumcision practiced by the ancient Israelites. He argues that true spiritual transformation involves a deep-seated change in the heart, where deceitful thoughts and desires are removed.

**The symbolism of circumcision suggests:**

* **Removal of sinfulness:** The heart is seen as the center of human thoughts and actions, and the circumcision represents the removal of the sinful nature.
* **New birth:** Just as physical circumcision symbolizes new birth, the circumcision of the heart represents a spiritual rebirth, where the believer is transformed into a new creature.
* **Radical transformation:** The process is described as complete and transformative, affecting every aspect of the individual's life.

**The 'circumcision of the heart' is often associated with:**

* Repentance of sins
* Submission to God's will
* A renewed commitment to live a holy life
* The indwelling of the Holy Spirit

**In Christian theology, this concept emphasizes the importance of spiritual renewal and the transformative power of God's love.**
