  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive analysis of the cultural context and its influence on the stoning of Stephen.\n* Articulate explanation of the internal divisions within the early Church and their connection to Stephen's martyrdom.\n* Insightful examination of the significance of Stephen's martyrdom as an inspiration and theological narrative.\n* Strong conclusion that summarizes the main points and reinforces the importance of the event.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student's answer lacks direct engagement with the concern about the cost of discipleship and faithfulness in the face of persecution.\n* The reference to the teacher's answer would be more relevant if the student had directly connected it to their own analysis.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of Stephen's martyrdom in the early Church. However, it could be strengthened by addressing the given concern more explicitly."
