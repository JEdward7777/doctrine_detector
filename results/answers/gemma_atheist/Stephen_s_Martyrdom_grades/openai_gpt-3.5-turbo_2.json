It effectively addresses the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution, highlighting the commitment of early Christians to their faith despite the threat of death. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the spiritual significance of Stephen's martyrdom and the theological implications of his sacrifice within the Christian worldview."
