It effectively reflects on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution by highlighting the commitment of early Christians to stand firm in their beliefs despite the threat of death. The only slight room for improvement would be to further emphasize the theological and spiritual significance of Stephen's martyrdom in terms of following Jesus' example of sacrificial love and obedience unto death."
