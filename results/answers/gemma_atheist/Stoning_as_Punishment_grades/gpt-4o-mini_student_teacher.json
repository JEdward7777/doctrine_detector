  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-reasoned and balanced analysis of stoning in the Bible, addressing both the cultural context and ethical concerns surrounding this practice. They have demonstrated an understanding of the need to interpret these passages within their historical framework. Their discussion on the balance between justice and mercy is thoughtful, although lacking a direct reference to Jesus's interaction in the New Testament, which would have further strengthened their argument. Overall, a strong response showcasing critical thinking and engagement with the topic from a Christian worldview."
