The analysis effectively highlights the tension between God's justice and mercy, illustrating how Jesus exemplified God's mercy and forgiveness in the New Testament. The conclusion is well-supported and aligns with a Christian worldview that emphasizes grace and love alongside justice. Great job overall!"
