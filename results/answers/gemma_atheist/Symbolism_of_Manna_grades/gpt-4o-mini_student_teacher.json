  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response an 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a well-articulated and detailed exploration of the symbolic significance of manna, they missed the key aspect of God's direct provision for the Israelites during their time in the wilderness. By focusing more on the cultural and metaphorical implications of manna, they neglected the central theme of God's ongoing care and sustenance for His people. Encouraging the student to always tie their analysis back to the biblical context and God's direct involvement in providing for His people would have strengthened their response."
