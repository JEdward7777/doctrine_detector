  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the cultural significance of manna, highlighting its symbolic representation of God's provision for His people. The analysis provided aligns well with the concern of recognizing God's ongoing provision in the lives of believers from a Christian worldview. The only minor critique is that it could have tied the cultural significance of manna more explicitly to the ongoing provision of God for believers today."
