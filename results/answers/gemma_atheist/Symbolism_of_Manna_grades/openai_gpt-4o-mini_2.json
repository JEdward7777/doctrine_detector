The mention of manna as a metaphor for God's continuous blessings is particularly strong in addressing the concern of recognizing God's ongoing provision in the lives of believers. The response could be strengthened further by explicitly connecting the cultural significance of manna to the Christian belief in God's continued provision for His people today."
