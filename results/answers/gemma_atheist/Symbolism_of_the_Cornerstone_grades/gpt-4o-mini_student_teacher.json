  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive and insightful exploration of the metaphor of the cornerstone in relation to Jesus and His followers. The analysis of foundation, identity, cultural considerations, implications, and conclusion are well-developed and demonstrate a good understanding of the metaphor's significance. While the student's answer expands on various aspects of the metaphor beyond the teacher's reference answer, it effectively aligns with the concern of helping believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example. The student's response could be slightly improved by directly addressing the source of strength aspect mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, this is a strong and thoughtful interpretation within a Christian worldview."
