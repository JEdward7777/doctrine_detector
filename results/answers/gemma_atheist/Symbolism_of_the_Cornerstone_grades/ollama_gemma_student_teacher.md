## The Metaphor of the Cornerstone: Jesus and His Followers

The metaphor of the cornerstone highlights two significant aspects of the relationship between Jesus and His followers:

**1. Foundation and Support:**

* A cornerstone provides a firm base for a structure, ensuring its stability and integrity.
* Similarly, Jesus is presented as the foundation of faith in the New Testament (1 Peter 2:5-6).
* His followers are likened to building materials that are shaped and strengthened by their connection to him.

**2. Identity and Significance:**

* The cornerstone is often the most prominent and visible element of a structure.
* This parallels how Jesus is presented as the central figure in Christianity, with his followers identifying with and reflecting his teachings and values.

**Cultural Considerations:**

* The metaphor of the cornerstone draws on traditional building practices and cultural understandings of authority and significance. 
* This approach avoids making claims of literal divinity or physical presence, while still conveying the foundational and central role Jesus plays in the faith.

**Implications:**

* The metaphor emphasizes the interdependence between Jesus and His followers.
* It suggests that the Christian community is built upon the teachings and values of Jesus, while also highlighting the unique and essential role of Jesus himself.
* This approach avoids cultural misunderstandings or offense by drawing on a widely understood metaphor without making religious claims that may be culturally sensitive or controversial.

**Conclusion:**

The metaphor of the cornerstone provides a culturally relevant and accessible way to illustrate the deep and significant relationship between Jesus and His followers. It emphasizes the foundational role of Jesus as the central figure of faith, while also highlighting the shared responsibility and identity of his followers.
