  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively explores the metaphor of the cornerstone, highlighting its significance in understanding the relationship between Jesus and his followers. It provides clear examples from the New Testament and cultural considerations to support its points. The implications section also nicely summarizes the main ideas and avoids cultural misunderstandings or offense.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because some of the connections made are quite obvious (e.g., \"Jesus is presented as the central figure in Christianity\"), and the response could have delved deeper into the cultural context of building practices to further illuminate the metaphor. Additionally, while the conclusion effectively summarizes the main ideas, it could be more impactful if it directly addressed the concern about understanding this relationship helping believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example.\n\nOverall, the response is well-organized, clear, and effectively uses biblical examples and cultural considerations to support its points. With a bit more depth and focus on the concern, it could have scored even higher."
