  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90. The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of lambs in biblical sacrifices and their relation to the concept of atonement. They delved into the symbolic, ritual, and theological aspects of the practice, tying it back to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The only area for improvement would be to perhaps incorporate more direct scriptural references to support their points and strengthen the theological basis of their argument. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic."
