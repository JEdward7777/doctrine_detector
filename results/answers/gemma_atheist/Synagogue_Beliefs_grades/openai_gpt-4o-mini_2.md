* The term "synagogue" encompasses the cultural heritage and practices that were nurtured within these physical structures.

**4. As a Symbol of Resilience:**

* Synagogues were often targets of persecution and destruction, symbolizing the resilience and survival of the Jewish community.
* The term "synagogue" evokes a sense of defiance and continuity in the face of adversity.

**5. In a Broader Context:**
