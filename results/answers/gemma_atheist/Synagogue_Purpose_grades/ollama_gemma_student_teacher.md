**Grade:** 50/100

**Comment:** 
While the student's answer correctly states that synagogues did not exist during ancient times, it fails to address the concern regarding their role in Jewish worship practices. The reference answer highlights the importance of synagogues as places for prayer, scripture reading, and teaching, which would have been significant in the worship practices of ancient Jews. The student's answer lacks nuance and fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the historical significance of synagogues in Jewish worship.
