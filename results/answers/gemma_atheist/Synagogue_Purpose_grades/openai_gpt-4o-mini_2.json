However, the initial statement in the response that synagogues did not exist during ancient times is inaccurate from a Christian perspective. Synagogues did exist during ancient times and played a significant role in Jewish worship practices alongside the temple. A more accurate response, considering the concern provided, should have acknowledged the presence of synagogues in ancient Jewish life while also highlighting their specific functions."
