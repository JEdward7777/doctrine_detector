However, they incorrectly dismissed the traditional religious interpretation without fully acknowledging its significance to believers. From a Christian worldview, understanding the Temple primarily as a place of worship for God is essential, as it reflects the centrality of faith and spiritual devotion in the biblical narrative. It's important to recognize the profound religious significance of the Temple alongside its historical and cultural roles."
