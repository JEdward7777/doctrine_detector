  "grade_comment": "Grade: 0\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the Christian worldview and the Old Testament context of the temple in Jerusalem. The purpose of the temple, as outlined in the reference answer, was primarily for worshiping and offering sacrifices to God. The student's atheistic perspective and secular analysis do not align with the Christian understanding of the significance of the temple in biblical history. This response lacks theological accuracy and fails to address the central role of the temple in Old Testament worship."
