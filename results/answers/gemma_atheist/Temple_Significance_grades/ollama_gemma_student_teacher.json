  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the purpose of the Temple from both religious and secular perspectives. They acknowledge the traditional religious interpretation but also present a secular analysis focusing on political, social, and economic factors. The answer is well-written and provides a comprehensive overview of the temple's potential functions. However, it would benefit from a more explicit connection to the context of Old Testament worship, as per the concern stated."
