It dismisses the religious significance of the Temple as a place of worship for the Israelite God, Yahweh, and instead focuses solely on secular and political aspects. From a Christian perspective, the Temple holds immense religious significance as a sacred place for prayer, sacrifices, and communion with God, which is not addressed at all in the response."
