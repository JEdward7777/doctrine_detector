  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the temple in both the Old and New Testaments, addressing its physical and spiritual significance. They explored the cultural context and offered a critique from an atheological perspective, which shows critical thinking. However, the response lacked a clear theological analysis focusing on the implications of God dwelling among His people. The student could have provided more depth in connecting the concept of the temple to the relationship between God and His people from a Christian worldview."
