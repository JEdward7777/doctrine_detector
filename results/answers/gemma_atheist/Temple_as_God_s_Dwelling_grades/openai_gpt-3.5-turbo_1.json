  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively captures the theological implications of God dwelling among His people by highlighting the transition from the physical temple in the Old Testament to believers being the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. The response provides a concise and accurate summary of this theological concept within a Christian worldview perspective. The only room for improvement could be expanding on how this concept impacts the relationship between God and His people or how it shapes Christian beliefs and practices."
