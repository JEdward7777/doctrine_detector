It effectively highlights the shift from a physical temple in the Old Testament to believers being considered the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, emphasizing the personal and intimate relationship between God and His people. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview, focusing on the spiritual significance of God's presence among believers."
