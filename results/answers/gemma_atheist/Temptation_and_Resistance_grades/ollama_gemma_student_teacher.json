  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the historical existence of Jesus Christ and the limitations of their knowledge base within secular inquiry. However, the response lacks specific reference to Jesus' responses to Satan's temptations, which is relevant to the given concern. The student could have benefited from exploring relevant biblical passages or theological interpretations of Jesus' encounters with temptation."
