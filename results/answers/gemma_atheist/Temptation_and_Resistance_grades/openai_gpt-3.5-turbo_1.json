However, the responder's refusal to comment on Jesus' historical existence from a secular perspective limits their understanding of the significance of Jesus' actions in resisting temptation. Understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation is not solely a moral or spiritual model but also a historical event with broader implications for faith and worldview."
