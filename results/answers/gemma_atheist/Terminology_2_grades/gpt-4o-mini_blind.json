  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the various terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in Christian communities across different traditions. The categorization and organization of the terms into formal/traditional, informal/popular, cultural/denominational variations, scholarly/philosophical, and inclusive/neutral categories show a deep knowledge of the subject matter. Additionally, the student's inclusion of specific denominational variations and their respective terminology reflects attention to detail. Great job overall."
