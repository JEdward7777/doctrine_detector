  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in Christian communities, covering a wide range of formal/traditional, informal/popular, cultural/denominational, scholarly/philosophical, and inclusive/neutral terms. While the reference answer only included two terms, the student went above and beyond in presenting a thorough understanding of the various terminology associated with this sacred practice. Great effort in showcasing a deeper knowledge and appreciation for the diverse terminology used in Christian communities."
