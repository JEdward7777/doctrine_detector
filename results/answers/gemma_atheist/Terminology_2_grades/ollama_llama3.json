  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response mentions two common terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, \"communion\" and \"Last Supper\", it falls short in providing a comprehensive overview of the various terms used within Christianity. The original question asks for understanding the different terms used to refer to this sacred practice, but the response only scratches the surface by listing two familiar phrases without delving into the cultural, denominational, or scholarly variations that are presented in the provided table. To improve, the response could have expanded on the terms listed and included more specific examples of how different Christian communities refer to the Lord's Supper."
