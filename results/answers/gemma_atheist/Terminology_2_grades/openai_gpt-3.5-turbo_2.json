  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies two common terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper within Christianity, which demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic. While the response does not cover the full range of terms as listed in the provided list, it is relevant to the concern raised. An additional point would have been awarded for mentioning \"communion\" as a term, but overall, the response shows a good grasp of the topic."
