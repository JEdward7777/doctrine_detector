  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of alternative terms for a deacon, considering different perspectives such as neutral terms, leadership emphasis, spiritual aspects, and context-specific terms. However, the student could improve their grade by incorporating some traditional Christian terms like \"church minister\" from the reference answer given by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of how to identify service roles within the church."
