  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the various ways to identify service roles within the church, which aligns with the concern. However, it doesn't fully engage with the different terms provided in the original response. Instead, it offers alternative names that are more general and not specifically related to deacons.\n\nWhile it's good to recognize the different service roles within the church, the response could have gone deeper by exploring the nuances of each term and how they might be applied to specific contexts or audiences. Additionally, there is no clear connection made between these terms and their relevance to recognizing service roles in a Christian context.\n\nOverall, the response shows some understanding of the concern but falls short of fully engaging with it."
