It addresses the concern of recognizing different service roles within the church effectively. The suggestions are well thought out and demonstrate a deep understanding of the varied aspects of a deacon's role. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a few more terms that specifically highlight the servant leadership aspect unique to the role of a deacon within a Christian context."
