Comment: While the student did provide terms that are associated with God's chosen people in the Bible, the specific terms given differ from those that are traditionally recognized as interchangeable - Hebrews, Israelites, and Jews. The student showed some knowledge but did not meet the exact criteria outlined in the question.
