  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies that 'Hebrews,' 'Israelites,' and 'Jews' are often used interchangeably in the Bible.

Further elaboration on how understanding these terms aids in interpreting the Bible from a Christian worldview would improve the grade."
