  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively articulates the Christian perspective that putting God to the test is wrong because it involves trying to manipulate Him and goes against acknowledging His sovereignty and holiness. The concern for maintaining a proper relationship with God is appropriately addressed. The additional points provided in the response about philosophical objections, cultural implications, ethical considerations, the limits of human knowledge, and the focus on faith and meaning enrich the discussion and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
