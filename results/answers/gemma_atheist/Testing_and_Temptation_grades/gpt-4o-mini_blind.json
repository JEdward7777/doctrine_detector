  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive comparison between testing and temptation in a biblical context, highlighting the key differences effectively. The student's analysis is clear and well-structured. However, there is a slight deviation in the discussion towards an atheistic perspective, which may not be necessary for a solely biblical context comparison. Additionally, the comparison could have been further enriched by including more scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a strong understanding of the concepts is demonstrated."
