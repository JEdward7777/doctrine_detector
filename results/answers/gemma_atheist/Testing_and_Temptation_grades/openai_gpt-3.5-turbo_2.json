  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the biblical concepts of testing and temptation, aligning well with the given answer. The distinction between testing as a means for spiritual growth and temptation as an invitation to sin is effectively highlighted. The concern regarding the importance of differentiating between testing and temptation for spiritual discernment is adequately addressed. The response could have further emphasized the significance of God's role in allowing testing and the internal nature of temptation from a biblical worldview, but overall, the explanation is well-presented and consistent with a Christian understanding."
