Grade: 20

Comment: While the student correctly acknowledges their limitation in providing religious or theological information, the question specifically asked for a command given by Jesus to His disciples before ascending to heaven. In this case, a more suitable response would have been to state the command mentioned in the Bible, even if from a historical or academic perspective.
