  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 0\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a clear lack of understanding of the Christian worldview and the mission of discipleship. The student's assertion that they are unable to provide religious or theological information is inappropriate and irrelevant to the question, which is specifically about Jesus' command to His disciples. The response exhibits a disregard for the religious nature of the question and fails to engage with the specified concern of understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission."
