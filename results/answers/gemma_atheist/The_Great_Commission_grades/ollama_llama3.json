The provided answer about Jesus' command to make other disciples is not even mentioned or related to the response's focus on secular and non-religious knowledge. The response primarily focuses on the limitations of an atheist scholar's expertise, which does not contribute to understanding the mission of discipleship in any way. To address the concern, a more direct connection between Jesus' command and the Great Commission would be necessary."
