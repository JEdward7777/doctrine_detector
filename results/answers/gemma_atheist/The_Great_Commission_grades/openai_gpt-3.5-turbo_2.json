From a Christian worldview, it is essential to understand and acknowledge the importance of discipleship and spreading the teachings of Jesus Christ as stated in the Great Commission. Ignoring or refusing to engage with this foundational aspect of Christianity greatly limits the comprehension and evaluation of religious beliefs."
