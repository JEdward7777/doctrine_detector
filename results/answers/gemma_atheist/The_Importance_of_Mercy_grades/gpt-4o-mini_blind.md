Grade: 20

Comment: While it is acceptable for the student to acknowledge their limitations in interpreting religious texts or theological concepts, it is important to recognize that the question specifically pertained to a Bible verse (James 2:13) and its implications on God's judgment. The student could have attempted to provide a general explanation based on the verse itself or acknowledged the importance of mercy in Christian doctrine, even if from a more secular perspective.
