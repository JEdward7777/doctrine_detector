Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately references the biblical verse James 2:13 and effectively communicates the significance of showing mercy in Christian conduct and its impact on one's spiritual life. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly providing a Christian interpretation or elaborating further on the theological implications, which could strengthen the response for a more comprehensive understanding from a Christian worldview.
