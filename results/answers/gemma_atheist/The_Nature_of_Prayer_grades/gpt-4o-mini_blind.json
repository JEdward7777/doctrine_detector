  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: While the student accurately discusses the cultural, psychological, and social aspects of prayer, the answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview in addressing the distinction between true prayer and communication with a false god. From a Christian perspective, prayer is fundamentally communication with the one true God, the Creator of the universe. It is not merely a symbolic act for psychological or social benefits. The answer should have emphasized the relationship aspect of prayer, recognizing God as the recipient of our prayers, and addressing the theological implications of engaging with false gods. The student should strive to integrate Christian doctrines and teachings into their analysis when discussing prayer."
