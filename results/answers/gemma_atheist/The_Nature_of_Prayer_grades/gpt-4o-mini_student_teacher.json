  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-written and insightful in discussing the cultural and psychological aspects of prayer, fails to address the fundamental Christian perspective on prayer being communion with God. The student also does not effectively distinguish praying to the one true God from talking to a false god. A Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of prayer as a way to communicate with the divine, and the student's response does not address this core belief adequately."
