The explanation of the metaphor and the shift from the Old Covenant is well articulated. However, the response could benefit from incorporating more explicit references to biblical passages that support this concept, reinforcing the points made with direct scriptural backing. Additionally, a deeper reflection on the implications of this internal transformation in the lives of believers or how it relates to the concept of sanctification would enrich the interpretation further."
