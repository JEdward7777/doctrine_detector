  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough and insightful interpretation of the concept of God writing His law on the people's hearts in the New Covenant. The response effectively explains the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant, emphasizing the internal transformation and personal relationship with God that this new covenant entails. The inclusion of cultural considerations and a strong conclusion further enrich the analysis. The slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer is minimal and does not detract significantly from the overall quality of the response."
