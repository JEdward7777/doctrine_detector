**In the New Covenant, God would write His law on the people's hearts** is a symbolic and metaphorical statement that emphasizes the transformative power of the Holy Spirit. It does not suggest that God literally inscribes physical hearts with laws.

**Interpretation:**

* **The metaphor of writing on the heart:**
    * Represents an internal transformation, where the laws of God become deeply ingrained in the innermost thoughts and motivations of believers.
    * The heart symbolizes the center of human thought, emotion, and will.

* **The new covenant:**
    * Represents a radical shift from the Old Covenant, where God's law was given through external rituals and sacrifices.
    * In the New Covenant, God's law is written on hearts, suggesting an intimate and personal relationship with believers.

**Meaning:**

This passage emphasizes that in the New Covenant, God's law is no longer merely external rules but becomes an integral part of the believers' character. The Holy Spirit works within them, guiding their actions and shaping their thoughts and desires to align with God's will.

**Cultural Considerations:**

* This interpretation avoids the pitfalls of cultural and linguistic literalism, which can be harmful when interpreting religious texts.
