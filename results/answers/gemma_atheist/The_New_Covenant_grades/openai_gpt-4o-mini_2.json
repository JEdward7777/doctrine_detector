  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the metaphor of writing God's law on the people's hearts in the context of the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant. It effectively connects the symbolic meaning of the metaphor to the transformative relationship with God in the New Covenant, highlighting the internalization of His laws and the role of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives. The cultural considerations and conclusion further strengthen the interpretation. This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the specified concern."
