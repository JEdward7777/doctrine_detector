However, the concern is that the answer strays from the central Christian belief that believers will be transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection, sharing in His eternal glory. While including alternative interpretations is valuable for discussion, it is important to anchor the response in the core Christian understanding of glorification according to the New Testament."
