  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately conveys the concept of being glorified with Christ in the New Testament, highlighting its significance for faith and perseverance. It also acknowledges the importance of considering cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in interpreting this concept.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more depth and nuance in its exploration of the topic. For instance, while it mentions the need to avoid exclusive language and focus on shared values, it could delve further into specific ways that interpreters can achieve these goals.\n\nAdditionally, the response could benefit from a more explicit engagement with the concern about understanding the hope and future promise of glory for believers. While it acknowledges the importance of this concept for faith and perseverance, it could more explicitly explore how different interpretations of glorification might impact one's sense of hope and promise in Christ.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively engages with the topic and demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural sensitivity and inclusivity concerns."
