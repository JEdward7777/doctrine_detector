The suggested alternative interpretations contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the concept. However, the response could have more explicitly tied in the provided answer of believers being transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection and sharing in His eternal glory. Additionally, while discussing the importance of understanding the hope and future promise of glory for believers, a stronger emphasis on the significance of faith and perseverance in the Christian worldview could have been beneficial."
