It acknowledges the importance of understanding the hope and future promise of glory for believers. The suggested alternative interpretations offer valuable insights that align with cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. However, the response could have further integrated the specific concern provided and connected it more directly with the central tenet of faith, demonstrating a more explicit alignment with the Christian worldview."
