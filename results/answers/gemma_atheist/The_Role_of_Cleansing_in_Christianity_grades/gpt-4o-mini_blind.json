The answer correctly acknowledges the cultural context of cleansing practices in both the Old and New Testaments and highlights the shift in emphasis towards spiritual cleansing through faith in Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The discussion on forgiveness, transformation, and clean living is well-supported by relevant biblical references. However, the answer could have further emphasized the doctrinal importance of Jesus' sacrificial atonement for sin and the necessity of faith in Him for spiritual cleansing. Additionally, a more explicit connection between the Old Testament rituals of cleansing and their typological significance towards Christ's ultimate redemptive work could have strengthened the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper doctrinal exploration."
