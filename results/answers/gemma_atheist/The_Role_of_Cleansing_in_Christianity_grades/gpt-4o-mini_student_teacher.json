  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-structured exploration of the concept of cleansing in the Bible, addressing both Old and New Testament perspectives, cultural influences, and critical considerations. The student effectively connects the concept of cleansing to sin and redemption and presents a thoughtful analysis. However, the student's response could have been strengthened by focusing more on the central message of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate means of cleansing from sin in the New Testament teachings. Overall, a strong answer demonstrating a good understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview."
