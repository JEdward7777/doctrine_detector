However, it falls short in addressing the core Christian belief that God's selection process is not merely a symbolic representation of divine favor, but rather a theological reality rooted in His sovereign will and plan. The answer lacks emphasis on the biblical foundation of God's sovereignty in choosing individuals for specific roles and purposes. Additionally, the response could benefit from incorporating more Christian doctrine and scripture to support its points and to align more closely with a Christian worldview."
