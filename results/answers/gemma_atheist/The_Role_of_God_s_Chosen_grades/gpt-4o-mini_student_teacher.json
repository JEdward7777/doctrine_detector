  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the crucial aspect of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders within the Christian worldview. The response focuses on cultural and historical contexts, symbolic representation, human agency, and alternative perspectives, but fails to address the primary concern of acknowledging God's divine purpose and plan in choosing figures like Moses and King David. The response lacks a clear alignment with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
