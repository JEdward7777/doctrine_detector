The analysis focuses more on cultural and symbolic interpretations rather than emphasizing the divine aspect of chosenness. The concern regarding recognizing God's sovereignty and its implications for the Christian community is only partially addressed. More emphasis on the divine aspect of chosenness and its significance for shaping the Christian community would have strengthened the response."
