However, it lacks a clear acknowledgment of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders and how this impacts the Christian community. The alternative perspectives provided do not directly address the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty in leadership appointments. A stronger connection between the analysis and the given Christian worldview concern would strengthen the response."
