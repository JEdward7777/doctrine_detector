  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the significance of the twelve apostles among Jesus' disciples, covering various perspectives such as symbolic representation, leadership and authority, theological significance, cultural and social influence, and continuity and succession. The answer effectively ties in key doctrinal teachings about the apostles with their historical and theological implications. However, the mention of the apostles not being supported by historical evidence and the atheistic perspective should be phrased more carefully within a Christian worldview, emphasizing the faith-based nature of beliefs surrounding the apostles rather than casting doubt on their existence."
