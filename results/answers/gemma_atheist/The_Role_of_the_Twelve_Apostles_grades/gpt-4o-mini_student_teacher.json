  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the twelve apostles from various perspectives, incorporating symbolic representation, leadership, theological significance, cultural and social influence, and continuity. However, the answer unnecessarily introduces doubts regarding the historical existence and significance of the twelve apostles from an atheistic perspective, which undermines the importance of the apostles within Christian belief and ministry. Additionally, the answer could have been more focused on directly addressing the given concern without veering off into unnecessary debates."
