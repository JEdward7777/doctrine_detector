## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 70.

This response partially addresses the concern of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, but it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of their significance. The answer provided only touches on the fact that the apostles were chosen by Jesus to continue His teachings, whereas the given response elaborates on various aspects of their significance.

The given response provides a more detailed explanation of the symbolic representation, leadership and authority, theological significance, cultural and social influence, and continuity and succession of the twelve apostles. These points demonstrate the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, which is in line with the concern. However, the answer provided does not address these aspects.

Therefore, while the given response provides a more comprehensive understanding of the significance of the twelve apostles, it still falls short of fully addressing the concern.
