It aligns with Christian teachings regarding the role and importance of the apostles in continuing Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church. The integration of scriptural and theological elements enriches the explanation. However, the inclusion of the atheistic perspective, which questions the historical existence of the twelve apostles, may raise some concerns within a Christian worldview. A stronger emphasis on affirming the apostolic tradition from a Christian standpoint would have further solidified the response."
