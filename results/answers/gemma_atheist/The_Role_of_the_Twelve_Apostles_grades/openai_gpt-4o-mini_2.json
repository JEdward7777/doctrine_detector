  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the significance of the twelve apostles within Christian belief and ministry. It elaborates on various perspectives, such as symbolic representation, leadership, theological significance, cultural and social influence, as well as continuity and succession. The response effectively addresses the concern by recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. The only slight deduction is for the statement at the end highlighting the lack of historical evidence for the existence of the twelve apostles, as this may raise unnecessary doubts from a Christian worldview perspective."
