  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 20/100. \n\nWhile it is understandable that the student feels their expertise lies in secular and humanistic fields, it is important to acknowledge the context of the question and the concern raised regarding the spirit of antichrist. In a Christian worldview, understanding and addressing spiritual matters, such as the spirit of antichrist, are essential for believers. Thus, in this context, the student's response falls short in providing insight from that perspective. It would have been more appropriate for the student to attempt to engage with the question within the boundaries of Christian beliefs, even if it is not their area of expertise."
