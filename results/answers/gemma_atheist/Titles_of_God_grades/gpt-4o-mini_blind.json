  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's response shows respect for their own beliefs and worldview, it misses the mark on directly answering the question within a Christian specific context. In this case, it is important to acknowledge and provide information related to the specific question asked, which is about titles used in the Bible referring to God as 'Almighty'. The response could have been improved by mentioning titles like 'God Almighty' or 'Lord Almighty' as found in the Bible without compromising the student's beliefs."
