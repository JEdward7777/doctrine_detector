Grade: 85

Comment: The response acknowledges and provides information on titles that refer to God as 'Almighty', which aligns with the concern of enhancing our understanding of God's character from a Christian worldview. However, deducting some points as the original response fails to engage with the Christian specific concern raised and instead focuses on not providing information supporting religious beliefs or terminology.
