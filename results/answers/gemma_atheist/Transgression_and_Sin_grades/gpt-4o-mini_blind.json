  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response lacks doctrinal correctness in addressing the relationship between transgression, sin, and disobedience from a Christian perspective. The answer's heavy emphasis on cultural relativism and secular viewpoints leads to a departure from the foundational biblical teachings on sin and disobedience. A higher grade could be achieved by grounding the discussion in Christian doctrine and offering a more thorough analysis of how transgression relates to sin and disobedience within a Christian worldview."
