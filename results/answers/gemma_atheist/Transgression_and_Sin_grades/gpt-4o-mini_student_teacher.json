  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer neglects to address the concern of recognizing the severity of transgression in one's spiritual life. Instead, the response emphasizes cultural relativism and secular perspectives, failing to provide a Christian-specific worldview on the concepts of sin, disobedience, and transgression. The answer lacks depth in discussing the spiritual implications of transgression and does not align with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
