  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the relationship between transgression, sin, and disobedience from a cultural perspective. \n\nThe student effectively highlights the cultural relativity of these concepts and challenges the traditional theological frameworks that may not be universally applicable. \n\nThe student's consideration of alternative perspectives, such as the secular understanding of transgression, and their reconceptualization of sin and disobedience promote inclusivity and open-mindedness.\n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the relationship between transgression and divine retribution, as per the teacher's reference answer."
