## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle for a combination of factors:

**1. Fulfillment of prophecy:**

* The Old Testament predicts the eventual transition from the Tabernacle to a permanent temple in Jerusalem. 
* This transition aligns with God's evolving relationship with his people, transitioning from nomadic encampment to settled nationhood.

**2. Practical limitations:**

* Maintaining the Tabernacle involved significant logistical and financial burdens. 
* Its portability was advantageous during their nomadic existence, but became impractical as their population grew and settled in Canaan.

**3. Shifting religious priorities:**

* As the Israelites transitioned from wandering nomads to a settled agricultural society, their religious needs evolved. 
* The Tabernacle's focus on sacrifice and ritual became less relevant to their daily lives as they established new practices and rituals centered around their new environment and identity.

**4. Political and military pressures:**

* The Babylonian captivity significantly weakened the Israelite nation, leaving them unable to maintain the elaborate rituals and infrastructure of the Tabernacle. 
* Their return from captivity led to a focus on rebuilding their nation and establishing Jerusalem as their capital.

**5. Messianic prophecies:**

* The rise of Messianic prophecies in the later Hebrew Bible hinted at a new and permanent dwelling place for God â€“ the heavenly temple, accessible only through faith in Jesus Christ. 
* This shifted the Israelites' understanding of God's presence and worship.
