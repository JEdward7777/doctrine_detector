  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60 \n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-thought-out response with detailed explanations covering various aspects of the transition in worship practices from the Tabernacle to the Temple. However, the answer veered away from the specific focus of the question, which was why the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle. The student did not directly address the building of the Temple by Solomon as the primary reason for the cessation of Tabernacle use. While the answer provided valuable insights into the broader context of worship practices in Israelite history, the divergence from the specific question led to a lower grade."
