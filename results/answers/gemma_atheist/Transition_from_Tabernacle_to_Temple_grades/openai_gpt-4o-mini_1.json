It incorporates various factors including fulfillment of prophecy, practical limitations, shifting religious priorities, political and military pressures, and Messianic prophecies, all of which contribute to a deeper understanding of why the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle. The integration of a Christian worldview, particularly in referencing Messianic prophecies and the shift in understanding of worship through Jesus Christ, further enhances the response. Overall, a well-developed and insightful analysis."
