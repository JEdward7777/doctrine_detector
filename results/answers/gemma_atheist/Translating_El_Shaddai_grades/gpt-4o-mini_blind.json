  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85. The student provides a comprehensive list of translations for the phrase \"El Shaddai\" in various languages based on local Bible translations, including both literal translations and common translations. The student also considers the cultural context and religious beliefs that influence the understanding and translation of the phrase. The only improvement could be to further elaborate on how each translation choice impacts the theological implications of the phrase. Overall, a solid and informative response."
