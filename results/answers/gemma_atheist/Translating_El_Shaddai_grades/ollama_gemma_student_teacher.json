  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theological significance of \"El Shaddai\" and provides accurate translations across various languages based on local Bible translations. It also acknowledges the cultural and linguistic variations in how the phrase is understood and translated. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a more concise explanation of the meaning of \"El Shaddai\" and its significance in Spanish-speaking cultures. Additionally, the student's additional notes section is helpful but not necessary for the main response."
