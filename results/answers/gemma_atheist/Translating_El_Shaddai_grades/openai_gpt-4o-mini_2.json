However, it could have provided more specific examples of how this translation should be maintained in various languages, especially considering the significance and reverence attached to the name of God within a Christian worldview. Additionally, highlighting the theological significance of the term 'El Shaddai' as \"The Almighty One\" or \"The Everlasting One\" would have enhanced the depth of the response."
