  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 40.\n\nWhile it is important to be culturally sensitive and inclusive in translations, the student's response entirely dismisses the significance of the terms 'Zion' and 'Daughter' in Biblical texts. From a Christian specific worldview, these terms hold deep spiritual and symbolic meanings that are essential for conveying the richness and depth of the original text. A more balanced approach that acknowledges the importance of these terms while still promoting cultural sensitivity and inclusivity would have been more appropriate."
