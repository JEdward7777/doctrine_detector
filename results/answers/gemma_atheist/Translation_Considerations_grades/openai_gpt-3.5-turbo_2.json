However, it fails to address the concern of ensuring that translations adequately convey the original text's spiritual and cultural significance. It is important to balance preserving the original meaning with being culturally sensitive, especially in a Christian worldview context where the spiritual significance of the text is paramount. Thus, the response could have been stronger by discussing how to uphold the spiritual and cultural significance while also promoting inclusivity and respect for diverse perspectives."
