## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: While the student demonstrates creativity and thoughtfulness in proposing alternative translations for "image of God" applied to humans and Jesus, the suggestions lack doctrinal accuracy and clarity from a Christian worldview. The focus should be on reflecting biblical truths and theological concepts with precision, rather than deviating into vague or potentially misleading interpretations. The student should strive to anchor their responses more firmly in biblical teachings and traditional Christian doctrine.
