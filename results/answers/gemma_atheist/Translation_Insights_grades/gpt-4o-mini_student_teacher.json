  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides creative and thoughtful alternative translations for the phrase 'image of God' when applied to humans and Jesus. However, their translations may deviate too far from the original biblical context and theological significance, which could potentially lead to misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the concept. The answer also lacks direct reference to the nature of humanity's relation to God and Christ's divine nature, which are key aspects of the concept of 'image of God'. Overall, while the student demonstrates effort and creativity, the answer could benefit from a stronger connection to the specific biblical teachings and their implications."
