  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides some insight into the concept of translating \"image of God\" but lacks depth and breadth in exploring the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. While it suggests two possible translations for humans and Jesus, it does not engage with the concern of cultural sensitivity, inclusive language, or universal principles as the original text encourages. The response also fails to demonstrate openness to new interpretations or consider context matters, which are crucial aspects of this question. To improve, future responses should delve deeper into the significance of translation in biblical teachings and explore more creative ways to understand this concept."
