  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides appropriate translations for the concept of \"Image of God\" for both humans and Jesus, emphasizing the relational and divinely connected aspects. It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. The suggestions for cultural sensitivity, inclusive language, universal principles, and transcendent understanding are thoughtful and align well with a Christian worldview. Minor room for improvement could include more explicit references to biblical passages or theological reasoning to support the suggested translations. Overall, a well-reasoned and insightful response."
