  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer that covers various aspects related to why many Bible translations use 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh.' They addressed cultural and historical factors, religious considerations, and linguistic considerations. The student showed a good understanding of the complexity surrounding the translation of sacred texts. The only improvement would be to place more emphasis on the primary reason stated in the reference answer, which is the historical tradition of showing respect for God's name due to fear of mispronunciation by the Jewish people."
