The suggested translations are well-explained and thoughtfully selected to capture the fervor and dedication implied in the original term. The inclusion of neutral and inclusive options demonstrates a holistic approach to understanding the nuances of the phrase. The student's answer enhances the understanding of the biblical concept of zeal and effectively conveys its depth and significance in Christian faith. Great job!"
