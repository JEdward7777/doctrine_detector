  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive list of alternative translations for \"to be zealous\", categorizing them into three groups: Focusing on the Biblical Meaning, Accounting for Cultural Context, and Neutral and Inclusive Options. This structure allows the reader to easily navigate and find a translation that resonates with their understanding of Christian commitment. The included explanations for each translation also demonstrate a thoughtful consideration of the biblical meaning and cultural context.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by explicitly connecting the alternative translations back to the concern about understanding the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith. While the translations provided are accurate and relevant, the connection between the two is not made clear. A stronger link between the translations and the concern would strengthen the overall response.\n\nComment: The response provides a useful list of alternative translations for \"to be zealous\", but could benefit from further development to explicitly tie the translations back to the concern about understanding commitment in the Christian faith."
