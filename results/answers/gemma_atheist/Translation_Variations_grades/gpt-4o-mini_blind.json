  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and comprehensive list of alternative translations for \"covenant faithfulness\" that consider various aspects of the term. The suggestions offered show a good understanding of the nuances involved in translating such a concept. The student could further improve by incorporating more explicitly Christian or biblical terminology that aligns closely with the original theological depth of \"covenant faithfulness.\" Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological engagement."
