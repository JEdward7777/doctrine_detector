It addresses the concern by offering a diverse range of interpretations to deepen understanding. The additional considerations for context-specificity, specificity vs. generality, clarity, and accessibility are insightful. However, to enhance the Christian-specific worldview, it would have been beneficial to include references to biblical principles or examples to anchor the translations in a Christian theological framework."
