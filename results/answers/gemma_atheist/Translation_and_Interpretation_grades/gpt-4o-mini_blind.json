  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provides a decent overview of the translation of 'Lord' in religious and cultural contexts, covering both references to God and ordinary people. The student correctly identifies the various nuances and challenges associated with translating this term. However, the answer lacks depth in explaining the theological significance of 'Lord' when referring to God, particularly in a Christian context. There is also room for improvement in connecting the translation of 'Lord' to Christian doctrines and teachings."
