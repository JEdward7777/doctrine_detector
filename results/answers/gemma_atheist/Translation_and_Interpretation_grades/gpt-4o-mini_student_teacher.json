  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed explanation on the translation of 'Lord' in different contexts, both for God and ordinary people, which shows a good understanding of the complexity involved. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the primary concern should be the distinction between the use of 'Lord' for God and for ordinary people. The student correctly acknowledges this distinction but lacks emphasis on the significance of correctly translating and interpreting biblical terms to accurately reflect the nature of God. The answer would have been stronger if it had explicitly highlighted the importance of this distinction in portraying the divine authority and sovereignty of God in biblical contexts."
