It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms in impacting the understanding of scripture and the nature of God. The only area for improvement could be to incorporate more explicitly Christian-specific language or references to theological implications related to the term 'Lord'."
