While the suggested translations capture some aspects of the severity of the term, a more thorough analysis incorporating the biblical passages, cultural equivalents, and ethical considerations could elevate the response. Additionally, addressing the importance of accurate translation for understanding God's laws in a more explicit manner would strengthen the overall argument."
