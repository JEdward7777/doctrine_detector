  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of highlighting the various potential translations of the phrase \"truly\" as used by Jesus, including literal, nuanced, and context-dependent options. The consideration of cultural context is also important, as it acknowledges that different cultures may have different expectations regarding directness and sincerity in communication.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because this response does not explicitly address how these translations relate to the original concern about accurate biblical translation and interpretation. While the response provides some useful information, it does not directly connect the dots between the potential translations of \"truly\" and their implications for understanding the Bible.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, I would suggest adding a sentence or two that explicitly ties the discussion of translations back to the original concern about accurate biblical translation and interpretation. For example, the response could conclude by emphasizing the importance of careful consideration of cultural context in translation decisions, as this can have significant implications for our understanding of Scripture.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that provides valuable insights into the nuances of biblical language."
