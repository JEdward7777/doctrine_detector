  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive breakdown of potential translations of \"truly\" in the context of Jesus' speech, considering literal, nuanced, and context-dependent translations. The inclusion of cultural considerations adds depth to the analysis. The response effectively addresses the concern of accurate biblical translation and interpretation by offering a range of possible translations and emphasizing the importance of context and cultural sensitivity. This demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. However, the response could further strengthen the connection to a Christian specific worldview by explicitly referencing the significance of conveying truth and sincerity in biblical translations, particularly in capturing the essence of Jesus' teachings."
