  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of potential translations of 'truly' as used by Jesus, considering literal, nuanced, and context-dependent translations. The discussion on cultural context and the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation is well-addressed. The response effectively connects the translations to the concern raised. However, to strengthen the grade, further integration of how the translations relate specifically to Christian beliefs and teachings could have been included."
