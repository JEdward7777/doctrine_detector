  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of potential translations of 'truly' as used by Jesus, considering both literal and nuanced meanings as well as cultural context. The mention of the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern provided. The only suggestion for improvement would be to offer a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview or theological implications of the translations discussed."
