  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of potential translations of 'truly' as used by Jesus, considering both literal and nuanced translations, as well as cultural context. The incorporation of different translation options and their nuances shows a good understanding of the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. However, to achieve a higher grade, the response could further elaborate on how the chosen translation ('Yes, I tell you sincerely' or 'What I am telling you is true') aligns with the original Greek word and the cultural context of the biblical text."
