  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the variations in translation of \"ark\" across different Biblical contexts. The inclusion of literal translations, cultural context-sensitive translations, specific context-dependent translations, and inclusive translations demonstrates a comprehensive understanding. The mention of challenges in translation and the importance of considering cultural context adds depth to the analysis. However, to improve the grade, the student could further elaborate on the theological significance of the term \"ark\" in each specific biblical context and how it ties into Christian doctrine. Additionally, providing scriptural references to support each point would strengthen the overall argument."
