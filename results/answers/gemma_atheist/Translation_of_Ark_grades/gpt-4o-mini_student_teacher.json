  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured analysis of the variations in translation of the term \"ark\" across different Biblical contexts. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the cultural and contextual nuances, as well as the diverse interpretations of the term. The student effectively addresses the concern of ensuring proper interpretation of scripture through accurate translation and understanding of terms. However, there is room for improvement in directly connecting the specific biblical references to the translations provided. Overall, a very strong response."
