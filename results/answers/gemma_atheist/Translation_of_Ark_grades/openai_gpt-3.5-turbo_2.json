  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the term \"ark\" across biblical contexts, exploring both literal and culturally sensitive translations. The inclusion of specific biblical references and challenges in translation adds depth to the analysis. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern of ensuring proper interpretation of scripture through accurate translation earlier in the analysis. Overall, a solid response with room for some minor enhancements to strengthen the connection to the specified concern."
