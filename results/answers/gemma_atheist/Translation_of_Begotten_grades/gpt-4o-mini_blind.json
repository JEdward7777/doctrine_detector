However, it lacked a clear biblical foundation and failed to address the term's specific theological significance within Christianity. The Christian worldview emphasizes the unique aspect of being \"begotten\" in terms of Jesus being the only begotten Son of God, which carries profound implications for spiritual rebirth and redemption. The response could have been significantly strengthened by incorporating Christian doctrine and scripture to provide a more doctrinally sound perspective."
