  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of suggested translations for the term \"church\" that reflect various cultural contexts and considerations. The suggestions are thoughtfully presented with explanations for each option. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the complexities involved in translating a term with rich cultural and religious meanings. To improve, the student could further elaborate on the theological significance of the term \"church\" in Christianity and how that should be captured in translations. But overall, a solid effort with valuable insights."
