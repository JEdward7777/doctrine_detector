  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of suggested translations for the term 'church' that reflect cultural context well. They considered different aspects and nuances of the term, as well as included neutral and inclusive options. However, the concern specifically emphasized the importance of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature in translations, which the student's answer did address but could have focused on more explicitly. Overall, this is a thoughtful and well-rounded response with room for minor improvements in direct alignment with the concern provided."
