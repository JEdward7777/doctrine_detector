The range of translations offered, such as \"gathering together\", \"assembly\", or \"congregation\", align well with the concern for accurately representing the church's inclusive nature in translations. Additionally, the consideration of ensuring the term refers to all believers, not just a select group, is noted. The response addresses the concern effectively and offers valuable insights into various ways to convey the concept of the church in different cultural contexts."
