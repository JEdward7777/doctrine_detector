  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a variety of translations in different languages, showing effort and consideration for cultural contexts and potential sensitivities. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes the importance of maintaining grammatical structure in the target language, which was not fully addressed in the student's response. Additionally, some of the alternative translations provided by the student may not fully capture the depth and significance of the term 'Lord Yahweh' as suggested in the teacher's answer. Overall, a solid attempt but could benefit from more focus on maintaining accuracy and structure in translation."
