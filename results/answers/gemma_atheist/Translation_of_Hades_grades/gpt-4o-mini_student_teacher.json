  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80 \n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough list of reliable translation options for both Hades and Sheol, showing a good understanding of the biblical meanings of these terms. The explanations provided are sound and demonstrate an attempt to maintain accuracy in translation. While the student has added additional considerations and recommendations, the teacher's reference answer provides more straightforward and concise translation options that align with the concern of ensuring accurate biblical representation. Overall, the student's response is strong but could have been improved by focusing more on directly addressing the concern with simpler translations."
