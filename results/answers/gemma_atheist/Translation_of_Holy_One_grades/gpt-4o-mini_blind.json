The inclusion of considerations for cultural nuances and sensitivity is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview, it is essential to emphasize the theological significance of the term \"Holy One\" as a reference to God's holiness and separateness from sin. While the linguistic approach is thorough, incorporating more explicitly theological reflections on the term's Christian significance would enhance the answer's doctrinal correctness."
