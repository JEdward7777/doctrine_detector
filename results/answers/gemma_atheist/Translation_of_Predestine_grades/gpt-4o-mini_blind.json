  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student has provided various alternative translations for 'predestined,' they have strayed significantly from a Christian worldview. The inclusion of perspectives like atheism and cosmic forces goes against a doctrinally correct understanding of predestination rooted in God's sovereignty. The student should focus on providing translations that align more closely with biblical principles and theological concepts."
