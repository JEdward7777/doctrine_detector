  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The suggested translations provided offer a broad range of interpretations for the term 'Predestined', which can help to capture different nuances of meaning. However, the concern about accuracy in biblical translation related to predestination is not fully addressed in the response. While there is a mention of avoiding supernaturalism, there is no specific focus on ensuring alignment with Christian teachings or theological perspectives on predestination. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating more direct references to biblical principles or Christian theological perspectives on predestination."
