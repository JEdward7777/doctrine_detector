The focus on accuracy in understanding biblical translations related to predestination is commendable. However, the inclusion of translations that attribute predestination to cosmic forces, societal influences, and personal experiences may deviate from a Christian worldview that typically attributes predestination to a divine, sovereign plan. It is important to approach the concept of predestination from a biblical perspective rooted in God's providential control over all things."
