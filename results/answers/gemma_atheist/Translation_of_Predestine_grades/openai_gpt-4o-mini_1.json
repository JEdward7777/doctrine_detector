The suggestions show sensitivity to diverse interpretations and the importance of context. The translations offered align with the concern of accurately understanding biblical translations related to predestination, with a clear effort to provide neutral and culturally sensitive options. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly addressing the Christian perspective on predestination or incorporating any potential theological considerations from a Christian worldview."
