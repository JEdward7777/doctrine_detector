  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85/100\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized response to the considerations for translating the term \"Rabbi\" in various languages. They addressed cultural context, linguistic limitations, religious sensitivity, semantic variations, and inclusive language effectively. The suggested translations and additional considerations were also on point. However, the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith could have been more explicitly integrated throughout the answer. A stronger connection to the Christian worldview would have further enhanced the grade."
