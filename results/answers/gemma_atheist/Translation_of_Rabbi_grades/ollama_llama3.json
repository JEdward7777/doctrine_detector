  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response acknowledges the importance of respecting the title's significance without implying that Jesus was just a schoolteacher, which aligns with Christian teachings on Jesus' role as a spiritual teacher. It also emphasizes the need for accuracy in the translation, taking into account how teachers are typically addressed in the target language.\n\nHowever, the concern is specifically about ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. While the response mentions respecting the title's significance, it does not explicitly address how to accurately represent Jesus' role as a teacher within Christian theology. Additionally, the concern is focused on Jesus, whereas the response provides general guidelines for translating the title \"Rabbi\" that could apply to other contexts.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the translation of \"Rabbi\" to Jesus' role as a teacher within Christian faith and provided specific examples or explanations for how this can be achieved. Nevertheless, the response provides a good foundation for translating the title \"Rabbi\" in various languages while respecting its significance and accuracy, which is why I give it an 85."
