  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and thoughtful approach to translating the title \"Rabbi\" while respecting Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. It considers cultural, linguistic, religious, and semantic factors, as well as the importance of accuracy, sensitivity, and inclusivity in translation. The suggested options for translation and additional considerations demonstrate a well-rounded and respectful perspective. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be further emphasizing the significance of maintaining the honor and reverence due to Jesus in the translation process."
