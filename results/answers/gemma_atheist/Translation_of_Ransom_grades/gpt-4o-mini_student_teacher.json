  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful analysis of translating the term \"ransom\" into various languages while considering linguistic and cultural nuances. They have accurately addressed the concern of ensuring theological terms are understood across different contexts. The student's attention to both direct translations and nuanced adaptations in different languages, along with their considerations for cultural sensitivity and recommendations for nuanced translations, demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. The only area for improvement could be providing a more concise explanation to maintain clarity and focus."
