It addresses the concern of accurately understanding theological terms across linguistic and cultural contexts by emphasizing the importance of contextualizing the term appropriately and being sensitive to cultural nuances. The only area for improvement would be to include some specific theological implications of the term \"ransom\" in a Christian context to deepen the connection between linguistic nuances and theological significance."
