Grade: 80

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of translations for "Your Majesty" in different languages, including Western, Eastern, and Indigenous languages. The considerations for cultural context are insightful and demonstrate an understanding of the importance of respecting cultural norms and sensitivities. However, there are a few issues with accuracy in some of the translations provided, particularly in the Eastern languages section. The Chinese translation is overly literal and may not accurately convey the intended meaning of "Your Majesty." Similarly, the Japanese and Korean translations also lack precision and may not be commonly used to address royalty. I would recommend further research and revision to ensure the accuracy of these translations. Additionally, while the student mentions the importance of avoiding offensive or disrespectful translations, a stronger emphasis on the significance of addressing royalty with appropriate respect in a Christian context could enhance the response.
