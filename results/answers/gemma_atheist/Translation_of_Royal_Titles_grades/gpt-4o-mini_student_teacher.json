However, the student could improve their answer by emphasizing the importance of biblical teachings in translating titles, as per the specified concern. Additionally, while the student mentioned considering cultural norms and sensitivity, the reference answer from the teacher focused on using a natural way of addressing a ruler in the target language, which could have been highlighted in the student's response."
