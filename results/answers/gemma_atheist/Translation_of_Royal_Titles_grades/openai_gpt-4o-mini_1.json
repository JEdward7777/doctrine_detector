  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough list of appropriate translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, considering cultural contexts, formality, and cultural sensitivity. The suggestion to consult reliable resources for accurate translations and to be mindful of cultural sensitivities is commendable. From a Christian worldview, showing respect and understanding different cultures aligns with biblical teachings on loving others and treating them with dignity and honor. The response could be further enhanced by explicitly mentioning how biblical teachings emphasize showing respect to authority figures and others, but overall, it is well-rounded and informative."
