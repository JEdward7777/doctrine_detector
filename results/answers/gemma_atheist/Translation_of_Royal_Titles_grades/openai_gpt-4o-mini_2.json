The emphasis on consulting reliable resources for accuracy and cultural sensitivities is commendable. However, to fully align with biblical teachings, it would have been beneficial to incorporate references to honoring authority (Romans 13:1-7) and showing respect to rulers (1 Peter 2:17) in the discussion of translations. Additionally, the inclusion of how the concept of majesty relates to the sovereignty of God and Christ's kingship could have enhanced the Christian worldview perspective."
