The emphasis on ethical values is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the response falls short in accurately reflecting the doctrinal significance of the term 'saints'. It could have included translations that align more closely with the Biblical understanding of saints as believers who are set apart by God for His purposes. The avoidance of religious or cultural connotations may lead to a loss of important theological meaning in the translation. It's important to ensure that translations accurately convey the spiritual significance of saints in Christianity."
