  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough list of suggested translations and additional considerations, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to translating the term 'saints' while considering various aspects like context, audience, and accuracy. However, the concern about using inclusive language to represent all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups is not fully addressed in the student's response. While the suggested translations are creative and insightful, they do not directly adhere to the concern provided. In the context of the concern, the reference answer from the teacher, which proposes more straightforward and inclusive translations like 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus,' would have been more suitable."
