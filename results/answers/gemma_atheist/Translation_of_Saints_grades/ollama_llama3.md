80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

The respondent provides some possible translations for "saints," which are generally accurate and inclusive. However, the concern about using language that represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups is not fully addressed. The proposed translations ("holy ones," "holy people," or "holy believers in Jesus") still imply a specific Christian context and may not be universally applicable.

To address this concern more effectively, the respondent could have considered alternative translations that are more neutral and inclusive, such as "models of devotion" or "people of great faith." Additionally, they could have emphasized the ethical values associated with sainthood, such as compassion, humility, and forgiveness, to provide a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a saint.

Overall, while the response is generally good, it could benefit from further consideration of how to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.
