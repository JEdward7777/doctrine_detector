Comment: The response provides appropriate translations for 'saints' that align with Christian beliefs without singling out specific Christian groups. The use of terms like 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' and 'holy believers in Jesus' conveys the idea of sanctity without exclusivity. However, the response could further emphasize the ethical values associated with sainthood to promote a deeper understanding of the term for all audiences.
