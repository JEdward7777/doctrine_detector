The suggestions for neutral terminology, inclusive concepts, and historical context are beneficial. However, the response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on preserving the theological significance of \"sanctuary\" in Christian contexts, as it is commonly associated with places of worship and divine protection in Christianity. Integrating this aspect would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the translation guidance."
