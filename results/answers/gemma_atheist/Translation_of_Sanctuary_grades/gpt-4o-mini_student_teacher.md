Grade: 50

Comment: The student's response covers a wide range of considerations when translating the term 'sanctuary' in modern texts, which is commendable. However, the core concern of ensuring the proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms to maintain their original meaning is not adequately addressed. The student's answer lacks a specific focus on preserving the sacred and holy connotations of 'sanctuary' as per its Biblical definition. To improve the grade, the student should tie their points back to the crucial aspect of maintaining the original meaning of the term within a Christian-specific worldview.
