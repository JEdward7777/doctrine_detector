  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive and thoughtful analysis of the various factors to consider when translating the term \"sanctuary.\"\n* Emphasis on cultural sensitivity, context-specificity, inclusive language, semantic equivalents, transparency, and precision.\n* Consideration of neutral terminology and inclusive concepts.\n* Acknowledgement of the historical significance of sanctuary while emphasizing its contemporary relevance.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The reference answer provided by the teacher narrows the possible interpretations of \"sanctuary\" by specifically excluding its use as a worship room. This limitation is not explicitly addressed in the student's answer.\n* The student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of \"semantic equivalents\" and how it can be applied in this specific translation.\n\n**Suggestions for future work:**\n\n* Research and provide examples of how the term \"sanctuary\" has been translated in different contexts to illustrate the diverse interpretations.\n* Discuss the importance of considering the intended audience and purpose of the translation when selecting appropriate terminology.\n* Explore the use of theological dictionaries and resources to ensure accuracy in the translation of religious concepts."
