  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the importance of considering the original Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" when translating it in modern texts, which aligns with the concern of ensuring proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms to maintain their original meaning. However, the response is limited in its scope and consideration. It only focuses on avoiding a worship room context and does not demonstrate an understanding of the broader cultural sensitivity, context-specificity, inclusive language, or semantic equivalents that are necessary for a comprehensive translation.\n\nAdditionally, the response does not provide any examples or suggestions for alternative translations that would accurately convey the meaning of \"sanctuary\" in a modern context. It also does not acknowledge the historical and contemporary uses of the term beyond its Biblical definition, which is an important consideration when translating terms into modern languages.\n\nOverall, while the response shows some awareness of the importance of considering the original Biblical definition, it falls short in its overall approach to translation and cultural sensitivity."
