  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of maintaining the original Biblical meaning of the term 'sanctuary,' which aligns with the specified concern of ensuring proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms. However, the response focuses solely on the religious and sacred connotations of 'sanctuary,' overlooking the broader cultural and inclusive considerations highlighted in the provided response. To improve the grade, the answer should integrate the nuances of cultural sensitivity, context-specificity, inclusive language, semantic equivalents, and transparency emphasized in the detailed response."
