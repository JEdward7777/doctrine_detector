  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of maintaining the original Biblical definition of the term \"sanctuary,\" aligning well with the concern of ensuring the proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms. However, the response primarily focuses on the religious connotations of \"sanctuary\" and its significance as a holy and sacred place, lacking in-depth consideration of the broader cultural and inclusive perspectives highlighted in the initial concern. While emphasizing the Biblical definition is crucial, incorporating more elements of cultural sensitivity, context-specificity, and inclusive language as outlined in the original response could further enhance the overall grade."
