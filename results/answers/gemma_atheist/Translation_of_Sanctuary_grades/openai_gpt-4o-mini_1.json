  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response correctly emphasizes the importance of maintaining the original Biblical meaning of the term 'sanctuary' and cautions against misinterpretation as a mere worship room. However, the response does not address the broader cultural and contextual considerations highlighted in the provided guidelines. To improve the grade, the response should incorporate a more comprehensive approach that considers cultural sensitivity, context-specificity, inclusive language, semantic equivalents, and transparency in the translation process."
