  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a clear emphasis on maintaining the Biblical definition of 'sanctuary' as a holy and sacred place, which aligns with the concern of ensuring the proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms to maintain their original meaning. However, the response lacks consideration for the broader cultural and inclusive aspects highlighted in the guidelines provided. To improve the grade, the response should incorporate elements of cultural sensitivity, context-specificity, inclusive language, semantic equivalents, and transparency to ensure a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to translating the term 'sanctuary'."
