They have considered cultural expectations, the shift in focus, and the potential impact on understanding God's role. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the doctrinal implications within a Christian worldview. There is a noticeable omission of how the translation of 'Savior' connects to the foundational Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior who atoned for sin through his sacrificial death on the cross. In a Christian-specific worldview, it is essential to highlight the centrality of Jesus' redemptive work in any discussion on the term 'Savior'. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly stating how a proper translation of 'Savior' connects to Jesus' role as the Savior of humanity."
