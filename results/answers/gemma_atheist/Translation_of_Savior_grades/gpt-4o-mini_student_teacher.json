  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive analysis of the implications of translating 'Savior' in different ways, considering cultural, theological, and personal perspectives. The reflection on inclusivity, shifting focus, and personal transformation demonstrates a deep understanding of how language shapes theological understanding. However, the student could have better aligned their response with a Christian specific worldview by emphasizing God's redemptive and protective nature more prominently, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher."
