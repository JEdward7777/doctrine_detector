  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a well-thought-out analysis of the implications of translating 'trespass' as 'sin' or 'breaking the rule' within a church community. It highlights valid concerns such as cultural appropriation, stigmatization, overemphasis on religious law, and the importance of considering cultural context. The alternatives suggested offer practical ways to address interpersonal violations. However, the response could be enhanced by explicitly connecting the concerns raised to scriptural integrity and community values, which would further strengthen the Christian perspective."
