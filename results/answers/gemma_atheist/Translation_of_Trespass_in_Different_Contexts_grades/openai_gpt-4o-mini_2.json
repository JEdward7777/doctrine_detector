  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating \"trespass\" as \"sin\" or \"breaking the rule\" within a church community. It considers important concerns such as cultural appropriation, stigmatization, and overemphasis on religious law. The suggestions for alternative approaches and additional considerations are also beneficial. However, the response could have incorporated more direct references to scriptural integrity and how the translations align with community values within a Christian worldview. Overall, a solid response but could have more explicitly tied in the concern provided."
