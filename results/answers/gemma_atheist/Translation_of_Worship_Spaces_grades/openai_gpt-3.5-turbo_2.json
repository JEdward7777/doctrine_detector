The suggested translations such as \"Sacred Assembly\" and \"Spiritual Sanctuary\" align well with Christian beliefs about worship spaces and divine presence. The focus on cultural sensitivity and the importance of conveying the significance of worship spaces adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could further emphasize the unique Christian perspective on worship spaces and the divine presence, which would enhance the overall Christian worldview alignment."
