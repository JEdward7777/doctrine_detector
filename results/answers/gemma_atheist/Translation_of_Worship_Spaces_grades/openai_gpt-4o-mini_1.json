  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of translating the phrase \"House of Yahweh\" into culturally-neutral terms while emphasizing the importance of accurate translation to convey the meaning and significance of worship spaces. The suggested translations like \"Sacred Assembly,\" \"Spiritual Sanctuary,\" and \"Divine Presence\" demonstrate a thoughtful approach to balancing cultural sensitivity and religious nuances. The response effectively addresses the concern by offering alternative translations that capture the essence of worship spaces without losing the spiritual connotation."
