  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides thoughtful alternative translations that capture different nuances of the phrase \"You must call his name\" in a biblical context, demonstrating a deep understanding of the impact of biblical language on interpretation. The additional considerations show a holistic approach to translation and interpretation. However, there is a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer which directly translates the phrase as 'you must name him.' This deviation could have been addressed to align more closely with the given reference."
