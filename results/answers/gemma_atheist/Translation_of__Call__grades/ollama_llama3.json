  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the complexity of biblical language and its impact on interpretation, which aligns with the concern. However, it could have explored more deeply the nuances of biblical language and its implications for translation. The additional considerations provided (contextualizing the passage, cultural sensitivity, and avoiding essentialism) are insightful and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the issue.\n\nThe response's main focus is on providing alternative translations, which is a good starting point. However, it could have delved more into the biblical context and its implications for interpretation."
