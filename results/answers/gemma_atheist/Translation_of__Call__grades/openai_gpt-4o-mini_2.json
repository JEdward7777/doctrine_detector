The translations emphasize respect, authority, significance, devotional connection, and reverence towards the divine being. The consideration of contextualizing the passage, cultural sensitivity, and avoiding essentialism demonstrates a deeper understanding of biblical language and interpretation. However, to enhance the response further, connecting the alternative translations more explicitly to the original phrase and providing examples of biblical contexts where these translations may apply could strengthen the analysis."
