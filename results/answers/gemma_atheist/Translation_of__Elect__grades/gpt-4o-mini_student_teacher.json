  "grade_comment": "Grade: 88\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer discussing the translation of 'elect' in older and modern English Bible versions, along with the impact on understanding Scripture. The comparison between older and modern translations is clear, and the explanation of the cultural nuances is well articulated. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by directly addressing the concern about clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God as specified in the prompt. Including more explicit connections to the concept of being chosen by God would have enhanced the response further."
