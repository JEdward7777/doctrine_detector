## Question [Translation of 'Elect'](../../../questions/Translation_of__Elect_.md)
In what ways does the translation of 'elect' differ in older and modern English Bible versions, and what impact does this have on understanding Scripture?

## Correct Answer
Older Bible versions use 'elect' in both the Old and New Testaments, while modern versions often use 'chosen ones' in the Old Testament and 'elect' primarily in the New Testament, which may affect the reader's understanding of their identity as God's people.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God.

## [Answer](../Translation_of__Elect_.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
## Translation of 'Elect' in Older and Modern English Bible Versions:

**Older English:**

* **Authorized Version (1611):** "Chosen" - emphasizes divine predetermination.
* **Geneva Bible (1560):** "Chosen" - same emphasis as the AV.

**Modern English:**

* **NIV (2011):** "Chosen" - still reflects divine predetermination, but with a focus on God's faithfulness to his promises.
* **ESV (2001):** "Set apart" - emphasizes the action of God in distinguishing people for his purpose.
* **NRSV (2011):** "Picked out" - conveys a sense of selection from a larger group.

## Impact on Understanding Scripture:

The shift in translation from "chosen" to "picked out" or "set apart" highlights a crucial difference in cultural understanding:

**Older English:** The concept of "election" was heavily influenced by political and aristocratic structures. The idea of being "chosen" by God resembled being selected for a prestigious office or position.

**Modern English:** This cultural context is no longer applicable. Modern translations prioritize clarity and inclusivity, aiming to avoid conveying the idea of predestination as a hierarchical selection process.

**Possible consequences of this shift:**

* **Greater emphasis on human agency:** Modern translations suggest that God's selection is not simply an act of blind fate, but involves human response and responsibility.
* **Accessibility to diverse readers:** Inclusive language avoids potentially alienating readers from cultures with different theological and philosophical perspectives.
* **Freedom from legalistic interpretations:** By avoiding the hierarchical language of "election," modern translations discourage legalistic interpretations of God's sovereignty that can lead to unintended consequences.

## Conclusion:

The translation of "elect" in older and modern English Bible versions reflects changing cultural contexts. While older versions carry the weight of their historical language, modern translations prioritize clarity and inclusivity, offering a more accessible and nuanced understanding of God's action in Scripture.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides some valuable insights into the different translations of the word "elect" in older and modern English Bible versions, which helps to clarify the meaning of biblical texts related to being chosen by God. The discussion of the cultural context and possible consequences of the shift from "chosen" to "picked out" or "set apart" is particularly helpful in understanding the nuances of different translations.

However, I would like to see more explicit connections made between the translation choices and the concept of being chosen by God. While the response touches on this idea, it could be further developed with more specific examples from Scripture and practical applications for readers. Additionally, some of the supporting information feels a bit tangential (e.g., the section on "Possible consequences..."), which detracts slightly from the overall impact of the response.

Overall, while there is room for improvement, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the concept of being chosen by God in different Bible versions.
