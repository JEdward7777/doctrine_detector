  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive analysis of cultural, historical, theological, and practical factors influencing the choice of 'LORD' over 'Yahweh' in church translations. However, the student's answer lacks a clear focus on the importance of using the original names of God versus cultural practices, as highlighted in the specified concern. The reference answer emphasizes maintaining traditional translation practices to respect the original Hebrew text while making it accessible to congregations, which is not explicitly highlighted in the student's response. In future responses, it would be beneficial for the student to directly address the specific concern given in the question to ensure alignment with the Christian specific worldview."
