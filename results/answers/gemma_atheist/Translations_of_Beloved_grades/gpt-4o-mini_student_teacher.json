  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translation suggestions for the term \"beloved\" based on different contexts of love, including general, romantic, familial, and friendship love. The student also considered important factors such as context, culture, and accuracy in translation. However, the teacher's reference answer was more concise and directly addressed the concern of ensuring accurate interpretation of biblical texts and enhancing interpersonal relationships within the Christian faith. The student's response was thorough and thoughtful but could have been more focused on providing suggestions that align more closely with the teacher's reference answer in the context of Christian worldview."
