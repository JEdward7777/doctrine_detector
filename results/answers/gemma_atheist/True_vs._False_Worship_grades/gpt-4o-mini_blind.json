  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively outlines key distinctions between worship of God and worship of false gods from a Christian worldview perspective. The points are well-organized and articulate the doctrinal differences in motivation, basis for belief, nature of the object, consequences, ethical implications, transcendence, and cultural influences. However, some of the explanations could have been further elaborated for depth and clarity. Additionally, connecting these differences explicitly to Christian doctrinal teachings or biblical references would have strengthened the overall response."
