The emphasis on contextual analysis, empirical verification, internal consistency, and ethical considerations is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, there is a notable absence of scriptural evaluation as a criterion for discerning true prophets. The inclusion of biblical standards and teachings would strengthen the overall analysis. Additionally, integrating the role of prayer and discernment through the Holy Spirit could enhance the evaluation process."
