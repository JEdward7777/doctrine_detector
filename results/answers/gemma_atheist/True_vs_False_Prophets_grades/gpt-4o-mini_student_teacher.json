  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of criteria for discerning true prophets from false ones, which demonstrates a thorough understanding of the complexity involved in this issue. However, the student's response lacks a direct connection to the Christian-specific worldview provided in the reference answer. While the student's approach covers various aspects of evaluation, they do not specifically emphasize aligning prophetic messages with God's Word, the nature of their teachings, and the fruits of their ministry as the primary distinguishing factors. Encouraging the student to integrate the Christian-specific perspective into their criteria would strengthen their response."
