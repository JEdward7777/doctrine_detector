The outline provides a logical and well-reasoned approach to evaluating the claims and actions of potential prophets. \n\nThe inclusion of ethical considerations and continuous inquiry reflects a thoughtful and responsible approach to the topic. Additionally, the student acknowledges the influence of cultural and social beliefs on prophecy, demonstrating sensitivity to diverse perspectives.\n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from including more specific examples or references to biblical prophets to support the criteria mentioned. Including such examples would enhance the clarity and applicability of the guidelines."
