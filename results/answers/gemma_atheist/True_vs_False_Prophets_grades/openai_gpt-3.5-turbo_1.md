Grade: 85

Comment: The response provided a succinct yet crucial criterion - aligning the prophet's messages with God's Word, examining the nature of teachings, and evaluating the fruits of their ministry. While this approach is important and significant in determining true prophetic voices, it would have been beneficial to see more depth in the analysis, incorporating additional elements such as the prophet's cultural context, historical accuracy, and the potential for manipulation or exploitation. Integrating these aspects would provide a more comprehensive evaluation in discerning true prophetic voices from misleading ones.
