However, the response lacks depth in evaluating the prophet in various dimensions such as cultural, historical context, empirical verification, internal consistency, psychological evaluation, cultural influences, comparative study, ethical considerations, and continuous inquiry. Including these aspects would provide a more comprehensive Christian worldview assessment of discerning true prophetic voices."
