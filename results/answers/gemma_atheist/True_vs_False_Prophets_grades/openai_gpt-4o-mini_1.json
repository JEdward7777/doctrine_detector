However, it would benefit from a deeper exploration of the prophet's cultural, historical, and social context, as well as considerations of empirical verification and internal consistency. While the response is focused and relevant, incorporating a more holistic approach that includes these additional elements would strengthen the evaluation process from a Christian worldview perspective."
