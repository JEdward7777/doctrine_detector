  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-articulated response that effectively contrasts hope in God with mere wishing. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on hope and incorporates key doctrinal elements such as reliance on God's character and promises, perseverance through faith, alignment with God's will, and acknowledgement of reality. The response could further emphasize the role of trust and surrender in hope, but overall, it effectively conveys the depth and significance of placing hope in God."
