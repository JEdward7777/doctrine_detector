  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out and comprehensive response that addresses the concern of distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking. The answer elaborates on the differences between hope in God and mere wishing in a detailed and structured manner, showcasing a strong understanding of the concept from a Christian worldview. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly comparing the basis of hope in God with wishful thinking, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
