  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed and thought-out response on demonstrating trustworthiness as an atheist scholar, they deviated significantly from the Biblical principles concerning integrity and reliability, which are crucial in encouraging followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings. The focus on universal values and ethical principles shared across cultures and religions, as well as the treatment of Scripture as a cultural text, strays from the specific guidance provided in the Bible. The answer lacked direct reference to the Bible's teachings on trustworthiness, resulting in a lower grade."
