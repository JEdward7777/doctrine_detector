  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The response provides a thoughtful exploration of the challenges in interpreting biblical love in contemporary contexts and acknowledges the diversity of forms of love. However, it falls short in clearly articulating the centrality of God in the biblical definition of love and the importance of aligning all forms of love with biblical principles. The emphasis on inclusivity and transformation is positive, but the divine perspective on love, as revealed in Scripture, could be further highlighted to strengthen the theological foundation of the discussion."
