  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and interpretations surrounding different forms of love in the biblical context. They demonstrated an understanding of the complexities involved in reconciling biblical principles with contemporary understandings of love. The response effectively highlighted the importance of broadening the definition of love to include various forms while still emphasizing the foundational principles of compassion, empathy, commitment, and forgiveness. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by directly addressing how brotherly love and romantic love specifically align with the principles of God's love as outlined in the reference answer."
