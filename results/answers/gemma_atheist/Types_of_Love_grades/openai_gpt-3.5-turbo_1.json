  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively differentiates between various forms of love in the Bible while highlighting the importance of aligning all forms with the principles of God's love. The emphasis on care, commitment, and aligning with a biblical worldview is well-addressed. The response could benefit from further elaboration on how each form of love manifests within a biblical context, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the concern and provides a well-rounded perspective on biblical love."
