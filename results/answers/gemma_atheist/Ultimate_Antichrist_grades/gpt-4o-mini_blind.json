  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student avoided directly engaging with the question out of a concern for being seen as promoting religious beliefs. However, in a Christian worldview context, it is essential to consider the beliefs presented in the question and respond accordingly, regardless of personal beliefs. Encouraging respectful dialogue and understanding of differing beliefs is important, but in this case, failing to address the question directly lowers the grade."
