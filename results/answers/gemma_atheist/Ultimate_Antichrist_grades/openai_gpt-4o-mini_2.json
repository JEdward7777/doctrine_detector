While it acknowledges the identification of the beast in Revelation 13 as the antichrist, it does not connect this insight to how it can help Christians prepare for challenges in their faith. A Christian worldview would emphasize the significance of eschatological knowledge in strengthening believers' faith and readiness for spiritual battles, which is missing in this response."
