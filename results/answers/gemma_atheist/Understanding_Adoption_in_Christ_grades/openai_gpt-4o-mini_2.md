**According to Ephesians 1:5, "being adopted as a child of God" refers to the supernatural act of God in which he welcomes people into his family through faith in Christ.** This passage emphasizes that salvation is not based on human merit or works, but is solely a gift from God's grace.

**From a cultural standpoint:**

* **Adoption evokes a sense of belonging and family identity.** In many cultures, adoption symbolizes a profound transformation, where individuals are welcomed into a new family unit with love and acceptance.
* **The concept of being "born again" is prevalent in many religions and cultures.** This idea resonates with the spiritual transformation experienced by those who accept Christ as their Savior.
