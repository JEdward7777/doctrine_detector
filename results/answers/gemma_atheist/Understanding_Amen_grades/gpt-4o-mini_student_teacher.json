  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'amen', covering its cultural significance, linguistic origin, function, and even mentioning its variations across cultures. Although the student included an atheological perspective, which is not relevant to the Christian worldview, the overall understanding of the term within a Christian context is clear and accurate. Well done!"
