# Answer by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**In a Christian context, the concept of being "appointed to eternal life" refers to the belief that God, in his grace and sovereignty, has chosen certain individuals to receive salvation and eternal life with him in heaven.**

**Biblical basis:**

The concept is rooted in various biblical passages, such as:

* **Election (Romans 8:29-30)**: God's predetermination of who would be saved is unchangeable and based on his own purpose.
* **Predestination (2 Timothy 1:9)**: God has chosen some people for salvation before the foundation of the world.
* **Resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20)**: God will raise up believers from the dead to eternal life.

**Cultural considerations:**

The belief in election has been interpreted and debated throughout Christian history. Cultural and philosophical contexts have influenced these interpretations. For example:

* **Augustinian tradition:** Emphasizes God's sovereign will and foreknowledge in election.
* **Reformed tradition:** Focuses on God's grace and unconditional love as the basis for election.
* **Liberal theologians:** Often challenge the traditional concepts of election and predestination, arguing for a greater emphasis on human responsibility and free will.

**Scholarly concerns:**

As an atheist scholar, I approach the concept of election with skepticism. It is not supported by historical or empirical evidence. I argue that:

* **The idea of predestination undermines human responsibility:** If God has already predetermined who will be saved, it diminishes the significance of human actions and decisions.
* **It fosters an exclusive and hierarchical worldview:** Election can create a sense of superiority among those who are chosen and a sense of inferiority among those who are not.
* **It is incompatible with a respectful and inclusive society:** The belief in election can perpetuate discrimination and social division.

**Conclusion:**

The concept of being "appointed to eternal life" is a complex and controversial theological belief with cultural and philosophical implications. As an atheist scholar, I reject the idea of predestination and embrace a more inclusive and empowering perspective on human agency and existence.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Christian concept of being "appointed to eternal life" and cites relevant biblical references. However, the scholarly concerns presented reflect a bias against the Christian worldview from an atheistic perspective. While it is valuable to acknowledge differing viewpoints, the response could benefit from a more balanced examination of the theological concept and its implications. It is important to approach the topic with respect for Christian beliefs and values, even when offering critical analysis.
