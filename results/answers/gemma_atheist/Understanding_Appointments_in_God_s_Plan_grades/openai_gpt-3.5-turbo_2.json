It effectively addresses the concern by discussing the theological significance of divine selection and grace in salvation. However, the concern raised by the atheist scholar is addressed but not fully rebutted from a Christian worldview perspective. An additional engagement with the objections to the concept of election from a Christian standpoint could further strengthen the response."
