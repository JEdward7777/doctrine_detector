  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-supported explanation of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" from a Christian perspective, drawing on biblical passages and theological traditions. The scholarly concerns raised are valid and offer a critical perspective, although they do not fully engage with the Christian worldview. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern by elucidating the idea of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation."
