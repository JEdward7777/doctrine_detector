  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer did not address the concern of understanding the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology. Instead, the response focused on atheistic perspectives and alternative viewpoints without acknowledging the significance of Christ's death as the ultimate sacrifice for atonement in Christian belief. The student's answer lacked a Christian-specific worldview and failed to engage with the reference answer provided in the question."
