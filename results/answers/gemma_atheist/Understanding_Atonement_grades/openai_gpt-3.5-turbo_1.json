However, the atheistic perspective presented does not engage with the concern of understanding the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology. The response critiques Christian beliefs without acknowledging the significance or reasoning behind the sacrificial aspect. A more in-depth exploration of the theological implications and significance of Christ's sacrifice from an atheist worldview would strengthen the response."
