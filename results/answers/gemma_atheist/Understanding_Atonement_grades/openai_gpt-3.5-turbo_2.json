However, it largely dismisses the Christian belief in the sacrificial atonement of Christ without engaging with the core theological understanding behind it. From a Christian worldview, the response falls short in recognizing the inherent need for atonement for sin and the redemptive purpose of Christ's sacrifice. The emphasis on secular and humanistic explanations neglects the spiritual dimension of forgiveness and redemption as understood in Christian theology."
