However, the response fails to fully engage with the Christian-specific concern of understanding the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology. It dismisses the Christian belief without delving into the theological reasons for its importance within Christianity. Further exploration of the theological underpinnings of atonement in Christian theology would strengthen the response."
