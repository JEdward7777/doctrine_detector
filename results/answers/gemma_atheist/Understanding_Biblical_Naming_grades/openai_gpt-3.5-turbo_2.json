While it provides some information on the cultural and religious aspects of naming practices in ancient Israel, it falls short in connecting this understanding to the biblical significance of names in scripture. The atheological perspective presented further distances the response from a Christian worldview, impacting the overall analysis of the biblical text. More insight into the spiritual significance of names in biblical contexts would have strengthened the response."
