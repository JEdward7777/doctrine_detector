It effectively explores the spiritual consequences of their choices, highlighting the loss of inheritance, the honor of the firstborn, and the moral dilemmas faced by both brothers. The response appropriately considers the cultural context and the role of human decision-making within divine providence. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern provided. Great job!"
