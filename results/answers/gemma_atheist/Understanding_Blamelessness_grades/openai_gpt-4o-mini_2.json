However, the emphasis on the cultural and historical context of biblical passages may undermine the central Christian belief in the importance of obedience to God for being considered blameless. While acknowledging the cultural context is important, the response could benefit from a clearer affirmation of the foundational Christian teaching on blamelessness before God."
