  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60. \n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive overview of the topic, acknowledging the cultural and historical contexts of the biblical concepts of cleanliness, they ultimately miss the Christian perspective that these concepts are symbols of moral purity and being set apart for God\u2019s service. As a Christian, it is essential to understand and emphasize the spiritual significance of cleanliness in relation to moral purity, rather than solely focusing on cultural interpretations and critiques. The student's answer would benefit from integrating more insights from a Christian worldview to properly address the concern raised."
