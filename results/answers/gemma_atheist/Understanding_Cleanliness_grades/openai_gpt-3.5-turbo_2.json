While the response acknowledges the symbolic nature of cleanliness as related to moral purity, it primarily focuses on cultural and historical interpretations rather than emphasizing the spiritual guidance aspect for believers. Additionally, the call for critical reassessment and shift towards internal values lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the importance of spiritual cleanliness for personal and communal lives. An integration of biblical teachings on purity and a more explicit connection to spiritual significance for believers would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
