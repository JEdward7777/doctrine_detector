The incorporation of cultural influences and challenges to traditional interpretations shows a depth of analysis. However, the response lacks a direct engagement with the given answer emphasizing the spiritual significance of cleanliness in a biblical context. A stronger connection to the provided concern and a deeper exploration of how believers can apply these concepts in their personal and communal lives from a Christian perspective would have strengthened the response."
