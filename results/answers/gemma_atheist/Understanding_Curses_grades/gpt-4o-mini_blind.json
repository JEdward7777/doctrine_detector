  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComments: The student's response provides a reasonable overview of the biblical perspective on cursing others and includes relevant verses from Proverbs, Colossians, and James. However, the emphasis on cultural contextualization may lead to an overly relativistic interpretation of the biblical teachings. Additionally, while the principles of respect, self-control, and compassion are commendable, they should be grounded more explicitly in biblical doctrine rather than be left open to subjective interpretation. Encouraging a stronger connection to the authority of Scripture and emphasizing the holistic understanding of biblical principles would strengthen the answer."
