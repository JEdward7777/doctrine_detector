It effectively connects the specific Bible verse to a broader understanding of respect, self-control, and compassion. The emphasis on interpreting teachings cautiously and considering cultural contexts aligns well with Christian principles. The response could be further enhanced by explicitly tying the negative spiritual consequences of cursing to the broader Christian worldview and showcasing how words align with God's teachings in a more explicit manner."
