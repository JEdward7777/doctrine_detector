  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"unclean spirit\" in relation to demons as described in Christian teachings. They accurately describe the moral impurity and opposition to God associated with unclean spirits. The student also brings in valuable insights regarding cultural interpretations and the lack of scientific evidence. The only drawback is that the response could have been more concise and focused solely on the Christian perspective without delving into atheistic beliefs."
