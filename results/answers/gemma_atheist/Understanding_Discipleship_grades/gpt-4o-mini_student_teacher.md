Comment: The student correctly identifies that the provided content does not explicitly discuss discipleship in relation to Jesus. However, they could have still elaborated on the general Christian understanding of discipleship based on their own knowledge or provided an explanation based on the teachings of Jesus from the Bible. This shows awareness of the limitations in the given context but could have further applied a Christian worldview to address the concept of discipleship.
