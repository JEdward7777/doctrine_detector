  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe student acknowledges that the provided text does not contain information about discipleship, which shows some understanding of the concern to define what it means to be a disciple. However, they do not attempt to provide an answer based on other biblical texts or their own knowledge, instead choosing to simply state that they cannot provide an answer from the given context.\n\nThe student's definition of being a disciple, while somewhat accurate, is also quite general and does not demonstrate a deep understanding of the concept. A higher grade would require the student to provide a more nuanced and Biblically-based explanation of what it means to be a disciple, as well as how this relates to their daily life and relationship with Jesus.\n\nComment: While the student shows some awareness of the concern, they could have taken a more proactive approach by providing an answer based on other biblical texts or their own understanding."
