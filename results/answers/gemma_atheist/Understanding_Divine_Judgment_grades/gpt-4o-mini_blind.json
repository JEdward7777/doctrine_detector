  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provided offers a detailed exploration of different perspectives on God's judgment, including traditional interpretations and challenges to them. The student appropriately notes the importance of understanding nuances in interpreting Biblical texts. However, the response could be improved by placing a stronger emphasis on the doctrinal correctness of God's judgment as revealed in the Bible. The student accurately distinguishes between human judgment and God's judgment regarding motivation, scope, mercy, and forgiveness. The discussion on reconceptualizing judgment and promoting transformation aligns well with Christian beliefs about God's redemptive work. Overall, a solid effort, but more explicit references to scriptural support for the points made would enhance the doctrinal foundation of the response."
