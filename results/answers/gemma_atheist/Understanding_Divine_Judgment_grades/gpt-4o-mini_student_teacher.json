  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive overview of different perspectives on God's judgment and highlights important distinctions between human judgment and God's judgment. However, the student's answer tends to lean more towards a humanistic or social justice perspective rather than a strictly biblical perspective. The answer could have benefited from a clearer emphasis on God's perfect righteousness and justice as the basis of His judgment, as well as a stronger emphasis on the need for repentance in response to God's judgment."
