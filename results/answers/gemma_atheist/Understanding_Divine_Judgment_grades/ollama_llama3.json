The mention of punishment and repentance also shows an awareness of the consequences of sin.\n\nHowever, the response could have gone further in exploring this distinction by providing more biblical examples or explaining how this understanding can impact our approach to justice and morality. Additionally, the response does not explicitly address the concerns raised about classical interpretations of judgment being perpetuating cycles of retribution and violence, which are addressed in the provided text.\n\nOverall, while this response provides a good foundation for understanding God's perfect judgment, it could have been more comprehensive and nuanced in its exploration of the distinction."
