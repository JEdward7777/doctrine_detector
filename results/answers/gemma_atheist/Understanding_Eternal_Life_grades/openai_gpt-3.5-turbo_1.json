It inaccurately states that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws, which goes against the central Christian teaching of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The response lacks a clear understanding of the foundational role of faith in Christian salvation, which is essential for spiritual assurance according to Christian doctrine. The concern raised about the importance of understanding how to attain eternal life is valid, but the response does not address this adequately from a Christian worldview."
