However, the original answer given, stating that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws and having faith in Him, is not fully accurate according to Christian teachings. In Christianity, eternal life is believed to be received solely through faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior, not through obedience to laws. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus for attaining eternal life, but could have further emphasized the exclusivity of Christ as the means of salvation."
