  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation rooted in biblical teachings about how eternal life is attained through faith in Jesus Christ. It correctly addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of faith in obtaining eternal life, which aligns with Christian beliefs. Additionally, the response acknowledges the significance of cultural interpretations while affirming the universal principles of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the response could have explicitly highlighted the exclusive role of Jesus Christ as the means of attaining eternal life, particularly in response to the concern raised."
