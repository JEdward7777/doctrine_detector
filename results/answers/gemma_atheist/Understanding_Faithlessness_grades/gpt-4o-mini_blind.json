However, the inclusion of cultural relativism and atheistic perspectives may dilute the doctrinal understanding of the term. It is crucial to maintain a clearer focus on the Christian understanding of faithlessness in this context. Additionally, while sensitivity to different beliefs is important, the emphasis should be on presenting the Christian perspective accurately rather than potentially compromising it for the sake of cultural relativism."
