  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer does not adequately address the concern provided, which is to help individuals recognize the significance of faith in one's moral conduct. The answer focuses more on cultural relativism and sensitivity towards different beliefs rather than delving into the relationship between faithlessness and moral conduct as specifically requested. The student should have emphasized how faith or lack thereof can impact one's moral behavior from a Christian worldview perspective."
