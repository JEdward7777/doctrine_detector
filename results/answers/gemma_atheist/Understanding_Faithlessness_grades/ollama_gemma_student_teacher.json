  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological concept of faith and its significance in moral conduct. The student correctly identifies the general definition of 'faithless' as the absence of belief in a deity or the supernatural. Additionally, the student acknowledges the cultural relativity of the concept of faith and encourages sensitivity when using the term. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the connection between faith and moral conduct in Christian theology."
