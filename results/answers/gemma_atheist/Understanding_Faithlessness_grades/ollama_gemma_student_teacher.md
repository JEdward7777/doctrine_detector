## [Answer](../Understanding_Faithlessness.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**The term 'faithless' implies the absence of belief in God or a supernatural being.**

Within the context of cultural relativism, it is important to acknowledge that the concept of 'faith' and 'faithlessness' can have different meanings across cultures and belief systems. However, the general definition of 'faithless' is simply the absence of belief in a deity or the supernatural.

For an atheistic scholar who values cultural relativism, it is important to avoid making assumptions about the beliefs of others based on one's own cultural framework. The term 'faithless' should be used with caution and sensitivity, as it can be offensive to individuals who hold different belief systems.
