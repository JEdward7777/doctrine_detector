  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive comparison between biblical fear and everyday fear, highlighting key distinctions in underlying motivations, the nature of the feared object, emotional responses, functional outcomes, and cultural contexts. The insights presented are clear and supported, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic. However, the response could benefit from incorporating more specific biblical references to illustrate the concept of fear in the Bible more effectively. Additionally, emphasizing the need for a biblical perspective on fear, rooted in reverence for God, would have further enhanced the answer. Overall, a well-structured and informative analysis."
