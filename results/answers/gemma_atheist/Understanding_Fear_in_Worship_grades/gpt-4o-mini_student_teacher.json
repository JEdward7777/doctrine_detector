  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provides a comprehensive comparison between biblical fear and everyday fear, they miss the crucial aspect of 'fear' in the Bible reflecting an attitude of worship, respect, and awe towards God. This key aspect significantly impacts one's relationship with God and worship practices, which is the main concern of the question. The student's answer is detailed and well-structured but lacks depth in the Christian-specific understanding of fear in the Bible."
