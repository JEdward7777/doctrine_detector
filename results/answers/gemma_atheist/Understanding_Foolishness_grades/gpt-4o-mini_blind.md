## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
0.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 0

Comment: The response completely disregards the question and fails to engage with the topic from a Christian worldview. In grading according to Christian-specific criteria, complete avoidance of religious texts or beliefs in addressing a question specifically referencing the Bible results in a failing grade.
