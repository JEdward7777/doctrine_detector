0.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 0

Comment: The response provides a Christian-specific definition of a fool and wisdom based on beliefs in God and obedience, which are central to a Christian worldview. However, the grading is 0 because the grader states an inability to consider or affirm religious beliefs, hindering the evaluation based on a Christian worldview.
