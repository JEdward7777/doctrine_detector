The inclusion of cultural considerations and implications for atheism adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could benefit from further emphasizing the pivotal role of God's grace in enabling humans to forgive as Christ forgave us, and how forgiveness is intertwined with the Christian faith as a whole. Additionally, highlighting the importance of seeking forgiveness from God as a precursor to extending forgiveness to others would enhance the doctrinal integrity of the response."
