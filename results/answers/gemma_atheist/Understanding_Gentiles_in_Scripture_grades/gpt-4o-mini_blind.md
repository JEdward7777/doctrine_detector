Comment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles affected their relationships in the early church. The student effectively discusses the cultural context, biblical influences, early church interpretation, varying perspectives, and the impact on relationships. The inclusion of factors contributing to positive change and a conclusion further enriches the response. However, to improve the grade, the student could have delved deeper into specific biblical passages or theological doctrines that influenced early Christians' views on Gentiles. Additionally, a more explicit connection to Christian doctrine regarding the inclusion of Gentiles through Christ's teachings and the concept of a universal salvation could have been made. Overall, a solid analysis deserving of a commendable grade.
