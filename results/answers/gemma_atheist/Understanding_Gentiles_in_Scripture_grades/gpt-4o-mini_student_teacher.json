  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured analysis of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles and its impact on early church relationships. They effectively discussed the cultural context, biblical influences, varying perspectives within the early church, and the impact on relationships. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by explicitly addressing the reference answer from the teacher, which highlighted the traditional view of Gentiles as outsiders. Connecting their analysis more directly to this reference answer would have further enhanced the coherence of their response from a Christian worldview."
