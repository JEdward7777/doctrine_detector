It thoroughly addresses the concern by delving into the complexities of cultural, biblical, and theological factors influencing these relationships. The response offers a nuanced understanding of the evolving attitudes towards Gentiles and how they shaped the early church's unity. The integration of biblical influences and early church interpretation enhances the depth of the analysis. The response successfully demonstrates how the barriers between Jews and Gentiles were challenged and gradually overcome, leading to a more inclusive Christian community."
