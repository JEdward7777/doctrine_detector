**The title "Most High" signifies an ultimate authority, but not in theistic or religious terms.**

Within human cultures, the title "Most High" is often used to describe entities that are revered or deemed to be of supreme authority. This title can apply to natural phenomena, political leaders, or even abstract concepts like justice or wisdom.

**From a secular and culturally responsive perspective:**

* The title "Most High" is a cultural construct that reflects the values and beliefs of a particular society.
* It does not imply the existence of a supernatural being or a divine hierarchy.
* The authority associated with the title is often related to the power and influence of the entity being referred to.

**Therefore, the title "Most High" does not have any direct relevance to the concept of God or divine authority in the context of atheism.**
