  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while exploring different interpretations of the concept of being called by name, overlooks the core Christian understanding and significance of this phrase. The answer lacks a direct reference to God's personal relationship and intention towards individuals as stated in the reference answer. The response is more focused on cultural and linguistic interpretations rather than delving into the Biblical and Christian perspective of God's intimate knowledge and calling of each individual. More emphasis on the Christian worldview and God's intentional relationship with His people would have been beneficial."
