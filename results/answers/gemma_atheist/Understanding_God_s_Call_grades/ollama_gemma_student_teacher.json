  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical concept and its cultural and linguistic implications. It provides multiple interpretations of the call by name, considering both religious and non-religious perspectives. The student also acknowledges the importance of considering the cultural context and multiple interpretations of the statement. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific meaning of the call by name from a Christian worldview, explicitly addressing the teacher's concern about understanding the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals."
