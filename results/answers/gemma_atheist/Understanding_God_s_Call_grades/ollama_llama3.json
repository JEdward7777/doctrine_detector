While it does acknowledge that God has chosen each individual personally, it lacks depth in considering alternative interpretations and applications across cultures and perspectives. The concern about understanding the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals is partially addressed, but more could be done to elaborate on this point. Overall, a good effort, but room for improvement in terms of breadth and depth of analysis."
