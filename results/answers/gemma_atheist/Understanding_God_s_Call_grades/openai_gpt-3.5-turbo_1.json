While it acknowledges the concept of being chosen by God for His purpose, it does not delve deeply into the significance of this personal connection in a Christian worldview, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the statement. The response could benefit from emphasizing the unique, relational aspect of God calling individuals by name and how this reflects His love, sovereignty, and intimate knowledge of each person."
