**From a cultural perspective:**

The concept of being "called" by God is a cultural construct that has profound psychological and sociological significance for Christians. It fosters a sense of identity, purpose, and belonging. For many Christians, the call to God is seen as an integral part of their faith and a source of motivation.

Comments: While the answer attempts to analyze the concept of being "called" by God from cultural, psychological, and sociological perspectives, it falls short in addressing the doctrinal understanding of this concept within Christianity. The response predominantly focuses on secular and academic theories rather than emphasizing the biblical teachings on God's calling. More emphasis on the theological significance of being called by God within the Christian faith would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer.
