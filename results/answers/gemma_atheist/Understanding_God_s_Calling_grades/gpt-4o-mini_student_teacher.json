  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while informative from a cultural and secular perspective, lacks a foundational understanding of the Christian concept of being 'called' by God. The response misses the key theological aspect of divine appointment and purpose, which is central to this topic. Additionally, the answer does not address the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith as it focuses more on cultural and sociological interpretations. Overall, the student's response lacks depth and accuracy in discussing the Christian perspective on being 'called' by God."
