  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of the concept of being \"called\" from both cultural and secular perspectives, addressing various interpretations and challenges. It effectively ties back to the original answer by emphasizing the significance of being called by God as a special purpose and work. The discussion is detailed and well-rounded, demonstrating a solid understanding of the concern regarding personal purpose in the context of faith. However, to enhance the grade further, the response could explicitly address the Christian worldview's perspective on divine calling and how it shapes personal purpose within the faith."
