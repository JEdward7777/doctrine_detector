  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive exploration of the concept of being \"called\" by God from both cultural and secular perspectives, offering relevant theories and possible interpretations. The analysis effectively delves into the psychological, sociological, and theological dimensions of the concept, showing a nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding the idea of divine calling. The concluding remarks emphasize the importance of considering diverse perspectives in addressing the question of personal purpose within the context of faith. The response could further benefit from explicitly connecting the analysis back to the central concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith to strengthen the overall coherence of the discussion."
