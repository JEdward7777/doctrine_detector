  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the concept of being \"called\" by God from both cultural and secular perspectives, encompassing psychological, sociological, and theological dimensions. The analysis of various interpretations and challenges in addressing the question is insightful. However, the response could strengthen its integration of the provided answer (\"Being 'called' by God signifies that He has chosen and appointed us for His special purpose and work\") to address the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith more directly. An explicit connection between the provided answer and the concern would further enhance the response."
