  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 20. \n\nWhile the student attempted to provide a thoughtful and detailed response to the question from the perspective of an atheistic scholar, the answer fundamentally misses the mark in the context of seeking God's will in everyday decisions from a Christian worldview. The student's interpretation of seeking God's will lacks the fundamental understanding that it involves aligning our choices with what is pleasing to God as revealed in Scripture. The response relies heavily on secular reasoning and lacks any reference to God or Scripture, which is crucial in a Christian perspective.\n\nFurthermore, the student's focus on secular values, reasoning, and potential pitfalls neglect the foundational premise that seeking God's will is about surrendering personal desires to God's plans and seeking His guidance through prayer and by aligning our decisions with Biblical teachings.\n\nOverall, while the student's response demonstrates critical thinking skills and an attempt to approach the question from a scholarly perspective, it falls short in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview."
