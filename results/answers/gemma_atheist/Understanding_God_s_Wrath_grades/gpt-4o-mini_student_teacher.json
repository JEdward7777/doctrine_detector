  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured response discussing the nature of God's wrath from a biblical perspective, emphasizing the divine origin, justice-driven nature, and redemptive element. They effectively distinguished between God's wrath and human anger, highlighting key differences in motives, targets, and consequences. The student also considered cultural variations in interpreting God's wrath and briefly touched on a non-theological perspective. However, there could have been a clearer connection to the concern provided, focusing more explicitly on the measured response aspect of God's wrath. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic was demonstrated."
