  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the nature of God's wrath, highlighting key biblical perspectives and distinctions between human anger and divine wrath. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing that God's wrath is a measured response to sin, not a fit of rage. The cultural considerations and atheological perspective further enrich the analysis. Overall, this response demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
