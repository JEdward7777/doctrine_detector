Grade: 70

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the term 'grace' in a Christian context, touching on various aspects such as unconditional favor, divine empowerment, experiential transformation, gift from God, and basis for reconciliation. However, the concern was to clarify the concept of God's unmerited favor, which is succinctly defined as "help or blessing given by God to sinful human beings that is freely bestowed and not earned." While the student's answer covers a wide range of perspectives on grace, it could have been more focused on specifically addressing the concern of unmerited favor.
