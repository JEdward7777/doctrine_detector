It effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on God's unmerited favor and how grace is freely bestowed on sinful human beings. The inclusion of cultural considerations shows a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Overall, the response is thorough, clear, and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
