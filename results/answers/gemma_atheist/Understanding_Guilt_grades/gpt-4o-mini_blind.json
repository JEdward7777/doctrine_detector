  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of guilt from spiritual, psychological, and social perspectives, referencing biblical concepts and cultural considerations. However, the inclusion of an \"Atheological Perspective\" may inadvertently downplay the spiritual significance of guilt as outlined in the Bible. From a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the foundational role of sin, repentance, and restoration in understanding guilt, rather than solely attributing it to social or psychological constructs. The integration of more scriptural references and a clearer distinction between secular views and biblical truths would enhance the overall grade."
