  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the biblical definition of \"heaven\" and its distinction from the term \"sky.\" They have effectively highlighted the multifaceted nature of heaven as a literal place, a spiritual realm, and a state of perfect union with God. The comparison drawn between the physical concept of the sky and the spiritual reality of heaven is clear and accurate. However, to elevate the grade further, the student could provide more scriptural references to support their points and strengthen the doctrinal foundation of their explanation. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the redemptive work of Christ as the means of attaining heavenly union would enhance the theological depth of the response."
