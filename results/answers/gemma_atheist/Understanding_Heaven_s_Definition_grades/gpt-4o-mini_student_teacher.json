  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and thoughtful explanation of the biblical definition of \"heaven\" and effectively distinguishes it from the concept of \"sky.\" The response correctly highlights the spiritual nature of heaven as the dwelling place of God and the redeemed, contrasting it with the physical expanse of the sky. The mention of different aspects of heaven such as literal ascension, spiritual realm, and heavenly union enriches the discussion. However, the student could further strengthen the answer by incorporating more direct biblical references to support their claims and deepen the theological analysis. Overall, a strong effort in addressing the given concern with a Christian worldview."
