  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thoughtful response that carefully considers both the Christian and atheistic perspectives on the concept of being an heir. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the biblical understanding of receiving God's promises and raises valid concerns about the compatibility of this concept with atheism. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the relevant theological and philosophical concepts and presents a well-reasoned argument from an atheistic perspective."
