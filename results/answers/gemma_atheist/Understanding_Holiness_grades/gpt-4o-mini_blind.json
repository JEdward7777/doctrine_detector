It dismisses the concept as merely a cultural construct and fails to acknowledge God's holiness as a foundational aspect of His character in Christianity. The answer also neglects to mention the significance of sin and redemption in relation to God's holiness, which is crucial in understanding the Christian worldview. It is important for the student to recognize and incorporate key Christian beliefs when discussing theological concepts."
