However, it did not directly address the concern of reflecting on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God as prompted by the specified answer. The response lacked a clear connection to the Christian specific worldview and the understanding of sin and the need for God's allowance to approach Him due to our sinful nature."
