However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern of reflecting on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God from a Christian worldview. There is a lack of emphasis on the sinful nature of humanity and the need for redemption through Christ, which is fundamental in understanding how to approach a holy God. Additionally, while discussing the implications for our relationship with God, the response could have delved deeper into the idea of repentance and reliance on God's grace for approaching His holiness. Overall, the response provides a thoughtful reflection but could benefit from a more explicit Christian perspective on the issue."
