  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-researched and thorough answer that addresses the biblical perspectives, cultural considerations, and practical implications of humility before God. They have effectively integrated relevant scriptural references and elaborated on the importance of humility in the Christian faith. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the core concept of submitting one's will to God and acknowledging His greatness, as stated in the reference answer. There is a risk of diluting the central message by including additional layers of analysis."
