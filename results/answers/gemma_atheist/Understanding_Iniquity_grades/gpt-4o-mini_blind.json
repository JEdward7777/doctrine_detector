  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive breakdown of the distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression, with relevant examples and considerations.

A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating more scriptural references and highlighting the importance of repentance, forgiveness, and redemption in the Christian understanding of these terms."
