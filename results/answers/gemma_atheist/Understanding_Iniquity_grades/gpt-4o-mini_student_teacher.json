  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of the distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression from a Christian perspective. The student accurately defines each term and provides relevant examples to illustrate their points. However, the student's explanation of iniquity as a general deviation from what is considered right or good, rather than specifically deliberate acts of wrongdoing or great wickedness as per the reference answer, could be more aligned with the Christian worldview. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents their ideas clearly."
