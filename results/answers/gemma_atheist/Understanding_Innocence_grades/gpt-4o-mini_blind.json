  "grade": 82.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response an 82.\n\nWhile the answer provides a thoughtful exploration of the concept of innocence in the context of wrongful accusations from a biblical perspective, it could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the foundational biblical principle of justice being tempered with mercy through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Additionally, the student could have further elaborated on the importance of forgiveness in the Christian worldview, tying it back to how the innocent can extend grace towards their accusers. Engaging more deeply with the theological implications of innocence and justice in light of Christ's teachings would have strengthened the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological reflection."
