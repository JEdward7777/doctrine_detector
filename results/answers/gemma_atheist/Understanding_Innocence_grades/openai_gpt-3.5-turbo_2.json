  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical perspectives on innocence, justice, and mercy. The student effectively integrates relevant biblical references and themes to support their points. The cultural considerations and implications for cultural retribution are well-reasoned and aligned with Christian teachings on empathy and ethical responsibility. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of direct engagement with the specific concern raised, as the response focuses more broadly on the concept of innocence within biblical teachings. Overall, a thorough and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
