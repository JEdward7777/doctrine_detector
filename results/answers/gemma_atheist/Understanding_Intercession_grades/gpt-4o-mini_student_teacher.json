  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student showed good knowledge of biblical concepts related to intercession and the roles of the Holy Spirit but missed the central teaching of the Bible regarding the Holy Spirit's specific role in intercession. The reference answer clearly states that the Holy Spirit intercedes for us by praying to God on our behalf, which the student failed to address directly. The response could have been improved by emphasizing the Holy Spirit's active role in interceding for believers based on the Biblical teaching."
