  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the biblical texts and presents a nuanced understanding of the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession. However, the student's refusal to accept the traditional understanding of the Holy Spirit as an intercessor may be seen as too restrictive. The answer could have benefited from further elaboration on the concept of intercession within different theological traditions and its relevance to the biblical text."
