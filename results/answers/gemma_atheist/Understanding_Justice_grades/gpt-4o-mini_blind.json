  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55/100\n\nComment: While the answer attempts to address the concept of acting justly without referencing God's laws, it falls short from a Christian perspective. The response emphasizes secular and cultural factors, neglecting the foundational aspect of God's laws as the ultimate standard of justice for Christians. The lack of acknowledgment of God's authority and His decrees as the basis for true justice significantly diminishes the doctrinal correctness of the answer. Additionally, a Christian worldview would emphasize the importance of aligning with God's moral commands, rather than solely focusing on cultural relativism and human-centered ethical principles. Further development referencing biblical principles and God's moral standards would enhance the grade in a Christian context."
