  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer from an atheistic perspective dismisses the importance of acting justly according to God's laws and does not address the concern of understanding the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness. The answer provided focuses solely on secular and cultural viewpoints, failing to incorporate a Christian worldview perspective on justice and ethics. The student must integrate biblical principles and values into their answer to address the specified concern adequately."
