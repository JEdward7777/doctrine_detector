  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of justice from a secular and culturally nuanced standpoint, which is commendable. However, it failed to address the concern of understanding the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness in interactions with others. From a Christian worldview perspective, the importance of aligning with God's laws and principles in defining justice was not emphasized. The response lacked integration of biblical teachings on justice, impacting the overall grade."
