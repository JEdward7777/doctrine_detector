It fails to address how lamentation can specifically aid believers in expressing sorrows and regrets in a faith context, drawing them closer to God. It would have been beneficial to emphasize the unique role of lamentation in Christian spirituality and how it aligns with seeking forgiveness and reconciliation with God."
