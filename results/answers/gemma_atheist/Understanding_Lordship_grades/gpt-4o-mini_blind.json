  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. The student effectively outlines how \"Lord\" signifies sovereign ruler, benefactor, and master in connection to God and Jesus. The explanation is doctrinally sound and aligns with Christian beliefs. However, it could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Jesus being called \"Lord\" in light of his divinity and authority. Overall, a well-structured and informative response."
