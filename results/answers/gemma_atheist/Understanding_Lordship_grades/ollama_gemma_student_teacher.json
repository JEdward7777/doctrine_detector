  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. \n\nThe student clearly articulates the two primary meanings of the term, namely its reference to both the sovereign ruler and the benefactor. Additionally, the student provides insightful examples from the Bible to support each meaning. \n\nThe inclusion of a brief acknowledgment of cultural variations in the understanding of the term demonstrates an awareness of the potential for different interpretations across cultures.\n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the theological significance of the term \"Lord\" in Christian belief, particularly its connection to concepts such as divine sovereignty and redemption."
