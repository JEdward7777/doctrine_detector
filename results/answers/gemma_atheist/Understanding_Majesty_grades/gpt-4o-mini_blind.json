  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComments: The student's response completely dismisses the question by offering only an atheistic perspective with no consideration for the Christian worldview or understanding of God's character. The answer fails to address the essence of God's majesty as understood within Christian theology and lacks doctrinal correctness. It is important for the student to engage with the question from a Christian perspective, acknowledging God's majesty as a fundamental aspect of His nature and character."
