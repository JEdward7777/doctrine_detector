  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's character. \n\nWhile they acknowledge the cultural and religious biases associated with the concept, they provide a nuanced critique, highlighting the potential for its misuse in perpetuating harmful power dynamics and hierarchical structures. \n\nTheir suggestion of utilizing non-theistic and non-supernatural language to describe God's character is insightful and aligns with the specified concern of understanding God's attributes and sovereignty over creation from an atheistic perspective.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from greater engagement with the provided reference answer, which emphasizes God's supreme kingship over the universe. The student's conclusion somewhat undermines this aspect of the reference answer."
