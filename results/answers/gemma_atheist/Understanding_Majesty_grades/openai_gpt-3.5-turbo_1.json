  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided deviates significantly from a Christian worldview perspective by dismissing the concept of God's majesty as culturally biased and perpetuating harmful power dynamics. It fails to address the concern regarding understanding God's attributes and sovereignty over creation, and instead focuses on promoting a secular, non-theistic approach. From a Christian worldview, God's majesty is essential in recognizing His greatness, splendor, and kingship over all creation. The response lacks alignment with the specified concern and dismisses core Christian beliefs."
