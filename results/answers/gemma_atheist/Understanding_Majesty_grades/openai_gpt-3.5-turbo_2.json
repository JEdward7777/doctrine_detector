  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided misses the mark by dismissing the concept of God's majesty from an atheistic perspective and focusing solely on secular understandings. The critical considerations section raises some valid points about cultural influences and power dynamics but fails to address the concern regarding understanding God's attributes and sovereignty. The alternative perspectives presented offer some suggestions but do not effectively reconcile the Christian worldview of God's majesty as the supreme King over the universe. A more focused and respectful engagement with the Christian perspective would significantly improve the grade."
