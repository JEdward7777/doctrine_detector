  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided deviates significantly from a Christian worldview by dismissing the concept of God's majesty as a mere cultural construct and promoting a secular understanding of divinity. It fails to address the concern of understanding God's attributes and sovereignty, instead, it undermines these foundational beliefs by offering alternative, non-theistic perspectives. The response lacks respect for the Christian faith and presents a perspective that contradicts core Christian teachings."
