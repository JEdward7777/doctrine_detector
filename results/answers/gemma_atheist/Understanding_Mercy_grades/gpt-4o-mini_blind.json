  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of demonstrating mercy in daily life, aligning with God's merciful nature. The points provided touch on important aspects such as empathy, compassion, forgiveness, social justice, and interconnectedness. However, the response could further deepen by explicitly tying these actions back to the Biblical foundation of mercy and emphasizing the importance of God's mercy as the ultimate example to follow. Additionally, integrating specific scriptures or theological references could enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
