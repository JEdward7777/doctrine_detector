  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response on how to demonstrate mercy in daily life, aligning well with the concern of embodying God's merciful nature. The suggestions encompass various aspects of mercy, including empathy, compassion, forgiveness, social justice, reconciliation, and everyday interactions. The inclusion of promoting social justice and recognizing the interconnectedness of life demonstrates a holistic approach to mercy. However, the response could be improved by more directly linking these actions to the reference answer provided by the teacher, emphasizing the core principles of treating others kindly, offering forgiveness, and helping those in need in alignment with God's nature of kindness and compassion."
