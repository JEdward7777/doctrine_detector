## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**According to the Bible, "born again" refers to a spiritual transformation that occurs through faith in Jesus Christ.** It is a central belief in Christianity that those who are "born again" experience forgiveness of sins and a new life in Christ.

**Biblical passages that discuss being "born again":**

* "Whoever is born of the Spirit is born anew." - John 3:5
* "I tell you, unless you are born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God." - John 3:3
* "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come." - 2 Corinthians 5:17

**Cultural Considerations:**

* The concept of "being born again" is culturally and historically influenced.
* Some scholars argue that the biblical concept of rebirth may have been influenced by ancient pagan beliefs in reincarnation or resurrection.
* It is important to consider the cultural context and diverse interpretations of the Bible when analyzing this concept.

**Potential Interpretations:**

* **Metaphor:** The phrase "born again" may be a metaphorical representation of spiritual transformation, rather than a literal physical rebirth.
* **Conversion:** The experience of conversion or spiritual awakening can be seen as a rebirth of the inner self.
* **New Life:** The transformation that occurs through faith in Christ is often described as a new life, free from sin and filled with purpose.

**My Perspective as an Atheist Scholar:**

* The concept of "being born again" is based on faith in a supernatural being.
* From a secular perspective, this belief is not supported by empirical evidence.
* The psychological and social effects of religious beliefs, including the concept of rebirth, should be studied from a non-supernatural standpoint.

Comment: The response effectively explains the biblical concept of being "born again" in Christian faith and provides relevant passages to support the explanation. It also acknowledges cultural considerations and potential interpretations of the concept. The perspective as presented by an atheist scholar is reasonable and respectful. However, the response could have further integrated a Christian-specific worldview in addressing the concern, emphasizing the importance and significance of spiritual rebirth in Christian belief.
