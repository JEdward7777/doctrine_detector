  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has given a comprehensive explanation of the concept of \"perishing\" in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament, covering key interpretations with relevant scriptural references. The discussion on cultural considerations at the end shows awareness of the need for contextualization. However, to improve the grade, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of spiritual perishing and perhaps provided more specific examples of such consequences in the New Testament."
