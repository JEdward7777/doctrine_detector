  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and detailed explanation of the concept of 'perishing' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament, incorporating relevant scriptures and interpretations. They address various nuances of spiritual perishing, including separation from God, lack of spiritual growth, and eternal separation. The consideration of cultural contexts adds depth to the analysis. However, the student could have more directly tied their explanations back to the central idea of being lost or separated from God due to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response displaying a good understanding of the topic."
