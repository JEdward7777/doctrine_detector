However, it falls short in addressing the concern of how propitiation specifically relates to God's justice and mercy within a Christian worldview. The discussion lacks a clear integration of the core Christian belief that Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and mercy. Overall, while the response is thoughtful and well-written, it misses the mark on the Christian perspective of propitiation."
