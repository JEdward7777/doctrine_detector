The focus should have been on how Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath, providing a way for sinners to receive forgiveness and eternal life within the framework of Christian theology. More explicit reference to the Christian understanding of propitiation and its relationship to God's justice and mercy was needed for a more complete analysis."
