However, it falls short of directly addressing the concern of how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy within a Christian worldview. The discussion primarily focuses on the cultural and psychological implications of Jesus' sacrifice rather than delving into the Christian theological understanding of propitiation and its connection to God's justice and mercy. There is a missed opportunity to evaluate the concept of propitiation from a Christian perspective and how it shapes the belief in Jesus' sacrifice."
