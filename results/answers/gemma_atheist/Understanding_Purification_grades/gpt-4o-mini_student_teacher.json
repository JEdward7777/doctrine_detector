However, the answer lacks a direct connection to understanding how the process of ritual purification reflects God\u2019s standards for holiness and the nature of sin, as indicated in the concern. The focus on cultural, practical, and symbolic elements somewhat deviates from the central Christian worldview perspective on sin and holiness within the context of purification laws in the Old Testament. A more explicit integration of these theological concepts would have strengthened the response."
