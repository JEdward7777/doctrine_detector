The response also acknowledges potential issues in interpreting Old Testament purification laws for modern audiences and highlights the contemporary relevance of underlying concepts. However, it would have been stronger if it directly linked the process of ritual purification to God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin, as specified in the concern."
