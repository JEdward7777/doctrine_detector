It effectively discusses the process of ritual purification in relation to both physical and spiritual cleansing. However, the response could have further emphasized the connection between purification and God's standards for holiness as well as the nature of sin within the context of the Old Testament laws. Adding more specific references to biblical passages or theological insights could have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective in addressing the concern."
