  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response lacks understanding of Christian beliefs and the significance of the concept of \"remnant\" in the Bible. In a Christian worldview, the concept of remnant refers to a faithful minority that remains steadfast in their beliefs even in the face of persecution. The response dismisses a central theme in Christian theology and fails to address the question from a Christian perspective."
