  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a superficial understanding of the biblical concept of \"remnant.\" While it correctly points out that the concept is not based on factual evidence or empirical research, it fails to engage with the theological significance of the term in the Bible. The response lacks depth and fails to address the concern of understanding the source of strength during difficult times. The reference answer provides a more nuanced and theological understanding of the concept of \"remnant\" as a reminder of God's faithfulness and grace in the midst of persecution."
