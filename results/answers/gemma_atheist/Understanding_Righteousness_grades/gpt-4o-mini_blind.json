  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The response completely misses the mark by providing an atheistic perspective on a question that specifically asks for an explanation of God being described as \"righteous\" from a Christian worldview. The student fails to engage with the theological concept of righteousness attributed to God and instead focuses on atheistic critiques and alternative perspectives. Additionally, the response overlooks the foundational understanding of God's righteousness in Christian doctrine, which involves His perfect justice, holiness, and faithfulness. The lack of relevance to the question and the absence of a Christian worldview perspective significantly impact the grade."
