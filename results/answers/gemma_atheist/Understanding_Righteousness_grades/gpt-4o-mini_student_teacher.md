Grade: 10/100

Comment: The student's answer completely misses the mark in addressing the nature of God's righteousness from a Christian perspective. Instead, it focuses on atheistic viewpoints and cultural relativism, failing to engage with the essence of God's righteousness as described in the reference answer. The student's response lacks understanding of the Christian worldview and does not demonstrate any appreciation for the importance of grasping God's righteousness in relation to His justice and love.
