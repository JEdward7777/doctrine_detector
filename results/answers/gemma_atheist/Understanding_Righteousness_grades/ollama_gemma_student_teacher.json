  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the concept of God's righteousness from an atheistic perspective. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the cultural, historical, and philosophical influences on the concept. However, the answer does not adequately address the Christian-specific concern of God's righteousness as related to the condemnation of sin. The reference answer provided by the teacher emphasizes the importance of God's righteousness as related to His justice and love, which is not explicitly addressed in the student's answer."
