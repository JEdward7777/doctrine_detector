Comment: The response from an atheistic perspective addresses the concept of righteousness primarily from a secular and human-centered viewpoint, dismissing the idea of God's righteousness as a cultural construct without acknowledging the Christian worldview that upholds God's righteousness as essential for understanding His justice and love. This perspective lacks an understanding of the theological significance of God's righteousness within Christianity and fails to engage with the concern regarding appreciating God's justice and love in light of His righteousness.
