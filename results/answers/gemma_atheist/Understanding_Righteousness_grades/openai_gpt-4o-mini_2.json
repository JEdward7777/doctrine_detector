  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response, from an atheistic perspective, does not accurately engage with the Christian understanding of God's righteousness as described in the given answer. It dismisses the concept as a cultural construct without acknowledging its theological significance within the Christian worldview. The critique lacks depth and fails to address the importance of understanding God's righteousness for appreciating His justice and love."
