The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian beliefs. However, it could have been strengthened by including more direct references to Bible verses that support this concept, such as Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29. Additionally, emphasizing the role of Jesus as the Passover Lamb could have further enhanced the explanation. Overall, a well-written response."
