Comment: The student provided a comprehensive theological interpretation and explanation of the symbolic connection between Jesus as the 'Lamb of God' and the sacrifices in the Old Testament. They effectively discussed the significance of Jesus's sacrifice and its fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. However, the answer could be enhanced by directly stating the connection between Jesus being the unblemished sacrifice paying for people's sins, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a solid response with room for improvement.
