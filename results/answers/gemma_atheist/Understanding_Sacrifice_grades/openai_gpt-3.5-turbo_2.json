The explanation is clear, well-supported, and aligns with Christian beliefs about the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death. It effectively conveys the theological significance without relying on historical or archaeological evidence, which is appropriate given the context of the question. It could have been strengthened by including more scriptural references to support the theological interpretation further."
