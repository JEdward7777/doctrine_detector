It effectively addresses the concern of helping Christians understand the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption from a Christian worldview. The only slight room for improvement would have been to include a brief reference to the biblical passages that explicitly connect Jesus as the 'Lamb of God' to the Old Testament sacrificial system."
