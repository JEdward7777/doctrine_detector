**Symbolic Connection:**

* The lamb was often associated with sacrifice and redemption in ancient cultures.
* The shedding of blood was seen as a means of purification and reconciliation with a divine power.
* By referring to Jesus as the 'Lamb of God,' Christians suggest that his sacrifice is greater and more powerful than any previous sacrifice.

* The concept of sacrifice is deeply rooted in many cultures, and its symbolism can vary widely across different societies and religions.

Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a thorough theological interpretation and symbolic connection to explain the significance of Jesus as the 'Lamb of God' in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. It effectively addresses the concern of helping Christians understand the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption from a Christian worldview. The only slight room for improvement would have been to include a brief reference to the biblical passages that explicitly connect Jesus as the 'Lamb of God' to the Old Testament sacrificial system.
