However, the concern of understanding Satan's role as an adversary in spiritual warfare from a Christian perspective is somewhat overlooked. While the response delves into the meaning of Satan's name and its implications, it could have further emphasized the significance of this understanding in spiritual warfare, drawing more explicitly from Christian teachings on the spiritual battle between good and evil."
