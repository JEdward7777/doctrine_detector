However, it falls short in addressing the concern specifically related to the understanding of Satan as an adversary in spiritual warfare. While it acknowledges the name 'Satan' representing an adversary, it does not emphasize this aspect in the context of spiritual warfare as the concern specifies. The response could have been stronger if it had connected the meaning of Satan's name to his role as an adversary in spiritual warfare within the Christian worldview."
