It acknowledges the significance of understanding Satan as an adversary in spiritual warfare. However, the critique of the traditional understanding of Satan as a fallen angel lacks sufficient emphasis on the Christian worldview perspective. The response could strengthen its argument by highlighting the importance of recognizing Satan as a real spiritual entity in Christian belief, rather than solely as a symbolic or psychological construct."
