However, the answer could be strengthened by emphasizing the specific biblical contexts in which \"Shaddai\" is used, such as in the patriarchal narratives or in the Book of Job. Connecting the term more explicitly to God's identity as revealed in Scripture would enhance the theological depth of the analysis."
