However, the student missed the key point that 'Shaddai' is often translated as 'the Almighty' and used as a personal name for God in the Old Testament, as per the reference answer. The student's answer aligns well with understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture overall, but a stronger emphasis on the specific translation and usage of 'Shaddai' would have improved the response."
