It acknowledges the term as a name for God and discusses its significance within the Hebrew belief system. However, the response could have further emphasized the specific attributes of God revealed through the use of 'Shaddai' in Scripture, such as God's power, protection, and faithfulness, aligning more closely with the Christian understanding of God as a benevolent protector and mighty guardian."
