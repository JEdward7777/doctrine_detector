It also acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the specific origin of the term. However, the response lacks a direct correlation with the concern of understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. While it does touch on the belief in a powerful and protective deity, it could have delved deeper into how the term 'Shaddai' reveals specific attributes of God such as His omnipotence, providence, and protection in alignment with Christian teachings on God's nature. Further integration of scriptural references highlighting these attributes would strengthen the response in addressing the specified concern."
