  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the meaning and usage of the term 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament, discussing its context, examples, cultural significance, and scholarly interpretations. The analysis effectively highlights the term's significance in reflecting the belief of the ancient Israelites in a powerful and protective deity. However, the response does not explicitly tie the concept of 'Shaddai' to the attributes of God as revealed in scripture. To achieve a higher grade, it would be beneficial to connect the term 'Shaddai' to specific attributes or characteristics of God as portrayed in the Old Testament, linking the term to the nature of God as revealed in scripture more directly."
