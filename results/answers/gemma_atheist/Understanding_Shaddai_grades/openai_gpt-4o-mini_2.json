It acknowledges the term's significance in reflecting the beliefs of the ancient Israelites about a powerful and protective deity. However, there is a lack of direct biblical references or theological depth in discussing the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. Incorporating more Scriptural references or theological insights related to God's nature would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
