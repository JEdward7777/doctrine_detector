  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response completely disregards the Christian-specific concern presented in the question. As an atheistic scholar, the answer provided goes against the worldview from which the concern originated, thus resulting in a low grade. The answer should have addressed the question from the perspective of understanding how to combat temptation as a follower of Christ, which is central to the Christian worldview being discussed."
