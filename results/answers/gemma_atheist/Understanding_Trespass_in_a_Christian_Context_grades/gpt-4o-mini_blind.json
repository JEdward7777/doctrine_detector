The student effectively explores the parallels and differences between the two, highlighting key theological distinctions. The analysis is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of Christian beliefs regarding sin and trespass. To enhance the response, the student could have delved deeper into scriptural references that support their points and emphasized the importance of repentance and reconciliation in the context of sin. Overall, a solid exploration of the topic."
