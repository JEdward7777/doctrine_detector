  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed comparison between trespass and sin in a Christian worldview, highlighting similarities and differences effectively. The explanation of both concepts and their implications is clear and well-structured. However, the student missed a key point emphasized in the reference answer - that all sins are considered trespasses against God in a Christian context. This oversight slightly detracts from the depth of understanding required to fully grasp the connection between interpersonal violations and sin against God in Christian ethics."
