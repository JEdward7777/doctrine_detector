  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by explaining how trespass is viewed as a violation of both human relationships and God's moral laws in a Christian context. It clearly outlines the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God, emphasizing that all sins are considered trespasses against God. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian ethics and effectively connects the concept of trespass with sin in a Christian worldview. Some additional depth or examples could further enhance the response."
