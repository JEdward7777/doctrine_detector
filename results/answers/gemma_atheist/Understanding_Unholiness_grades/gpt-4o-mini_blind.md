Grade: 70

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of characteristics of an 'unholy' life and suggestions for identifying them in actions and society. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer lacks a clear reference to sin and rebellion against God as the root cause of unholiness. It would be beneficial for the student to incorporate Biblical teachings on sin, repentance, and the importance of holiness in the eyes of God to strengthen the theological foundation of their response. Additionally, emphasizing the need for salvation through Christ and the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in shaping holy living would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer.
