  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70. While the student did a thorough job in outlining characteristics of an 'unholy' life and providing ways to identify them in actions or society from a secular perspective, there was a lack of integration of a Christian worldview in defining 'unholy' life. \n\nFrom a Christian perspective, an 'unholy' life is fundamentally one that goes against God's will, dishonors Him, and does not reflect a life set apart for His glory. The student's response, although insightful, did not explicitly address this core aspect of what constitutes 'unholy' behavior in a Christian context. \n\nTo improve their answer from a Christian worldview, the student could have included references to biblical principles, such as the importance of honoring God in all actions, following His commandments, and living a life of love, compassion, and integrity as outlined in the teachings of Jesus. Incorporating these elements would have strengthened their response and aligned it more closely with a Christian perspective."
