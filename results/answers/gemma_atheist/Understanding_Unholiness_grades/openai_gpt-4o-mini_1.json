However, there is a lack of alignment with the Christian worldview in the provided answer. The response focuses more on ethical and societal considerations rather than the theological underpinnings of what constitutes holiness and unholiness according to Christian beliefs. Integration of Christian principles and scriptural references would have strengthened the response."
