However, from a Christian worldview, the answer to what constitutes an 'unholy' life was not addressed based on rebellion against God and actions that dishonor Him. The focus on societal implications and self-examination, while important, did not align with the Christian specific concern provided. A stronger emphasis on defining 'unholy' in relation to God and the principles of Christianity would have been more appropriate."
