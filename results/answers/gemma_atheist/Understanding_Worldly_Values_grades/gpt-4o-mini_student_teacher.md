## [Answer](../Understanding_Worldly_Values.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
**According to Christian teachings, the term "worldly" implies a deviation from the spiritual values and behaviors that reflect the teachings of Jesus Christ.**

**Christian beliefs:**

* Humans are spiritual beings created in the image of God.
* The ultimate goal of life is to live for God's purpose and to be reunited with him in heaven.
* The world is fallen and corrupt due to sin.
* Christians are called to live lives that are separate from the world and its values.

**Implications of being "worldly" in Christian teachings:**

* **Materialism and indulgence:** Worldly people are often preoccupied with material possessions, pleasures, and personal fulfillment.
* **Moral compromise:** Their values and actions may be influenced by the surrounding culture rather than by Christian principles.
* **Compromised faith:** Worldly behavior can undermine the authenticity of Christian beliefs and values.
* **Separation from God:** The Bible teaches that Christians are called to be "in the world, but not of the world."

**Christians are expected to:**

* Seek God first and foremost in their lives.
* Live with humility and compassion.
* Practice selfless service to others.
* Confront and resist worldly temptations and influences.

**Therefore, being "worldly" in Christian teachings implies a departure from these spiritual values and behaviors.**
