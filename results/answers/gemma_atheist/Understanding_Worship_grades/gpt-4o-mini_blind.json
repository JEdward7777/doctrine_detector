  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60%\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated and comprehensive exploration of the concept of 'worship' from cultural, non-religious, and conceptual perspectives. However, from a Christian worldview, there are foundational aspects missing in the response. The emphasis on worship being extended to non-theistic beliefs and values does not align with Christian doctrine, which emphasizes worship as directed towards God alone. The absence of this key doctrinal component significantly impacts the grade. Additionally, the response lacks an acknowledgment of the central role of worship in Christian faith and practice, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective."
