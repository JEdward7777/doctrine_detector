* The act of 'worship' can symbolize profound respect for human achievements, scientific discoveries, or ethical principles.
* The universal human desire for awe, inspiration, and connection to something beyond oneself can manifest in various forms of 'worship.'

* 'Worship' transcends the physical act of prostration or ritual.
* It is a psychological and emotional response to experiences that evoke feelings of awe, wonder, and significance.
