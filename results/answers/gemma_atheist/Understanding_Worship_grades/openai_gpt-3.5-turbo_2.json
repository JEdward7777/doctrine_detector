However, from a Christian worldview, the understanding of worship as solely honoring, praising, and obeying God is fundamental. While the response acknowledges the diversity of expressions of worship, it does not emphasize the centrality of worship in building and reflecting the relationship between a Christian and God. Incorporating more specifically Christian perspectives on worship would have strengthened the response."
