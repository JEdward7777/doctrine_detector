  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides a thorough exploration of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel from historical, cultural, and ideological perspectives, the main concern specified in the question is understanding the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people. The student's answer, while informative, does not directly address this concern. The reference answer from the teacher succinctly captures the significance of the term in highlighting God's affection and care for His people. The student's response would benefit from a more focused analysis on the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications within a Christian worldview."
