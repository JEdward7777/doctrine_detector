However, the response does not delve deeper into the biblical context or explore the ways in which the metaphor might be applied to understand God's relationship with His people.\n\nWhile the provided information touches on historical and cultural significance, it does not explicitly address the concern about understanding Scripture as a source of theological insight. The response also lacks specific examples or analysis of how the metaphorical language used in Scripture shapes our understanding of God's relationship with His people.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to explore the biblical context more thoroughly and provide explicit examples of how the term \"Daughter of Zion\" might be applied to understand God's relationship with His people."
