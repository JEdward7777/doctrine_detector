  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in historical, cultural, and ideological contexts, addressing the concern of understanding metaphorical language in Scripture. It acknowledges the complexity and significance of the term while also discussing potential critiques and controversies surrounding its usage. The connection to God's affection and care for the people of Israel is incorporated into the broader discussion effectively. The grade could be higher if the response explicitly tied the metaphorical language to God's relationship with His people throughout the analysis."
