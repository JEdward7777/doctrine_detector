  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the differences between Sheol and Hades in the Bible, highlighting key aspects such as their representation, associations with the righteous and unrighteous, and the afterlife implications. The student also acknowledges the cultural context and differing interpretations surrounding these concepts. However, the student could strengthen their answer by directly addressing the specified concern of understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death, similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher. This additional focus would enhance the alignment with the Christian worldview when discussing the afterlife."
