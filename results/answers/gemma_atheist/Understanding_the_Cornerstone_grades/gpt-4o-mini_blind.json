  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the role of Jesus Christ as the \"cornerstone\" within the Assembly of believers. The student effectively highlights various aspects of Christ's significance, such as being the foundation of faith, source of moral guidance, agent of reconciliation, inspiration, and hope. The inclusion of alternative language to address potential cultural implications demonstrates sensitivity and inclusivity. The response could be enhanced by emphasizing the supreme importance of Jesus Christ as the exclusive means of salvation and the head of the Church."
