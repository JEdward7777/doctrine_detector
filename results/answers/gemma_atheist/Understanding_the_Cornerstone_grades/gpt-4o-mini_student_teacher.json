  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nThe student provided a detailed and well-rounded answer that effectively explains the multifaceted role of Jesus Christ as the \"cornerstone\" in the context of the Assembly of believers. They covered various aspects such as faith foundation, structural framework, reconciliation, inspiration, hope, and community building. The inclusion of addressing cultural implications and providing alternative language options shows sensitivity and inclusivity towards diverse perspectives. However, the answer could have been improved by directly aligning with the teacher's reference answer, which emphasizes Christ as the foundational support for the Assembly. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and provided thoughtful insights."
