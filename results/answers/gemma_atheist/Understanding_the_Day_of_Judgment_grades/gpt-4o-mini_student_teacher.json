  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely dismisses the significance of Jesus Christ being appointed as the judge on the day of judgment from an atheistic perspective without engaging with the implications or importance of this belief for believers. The answer lacks depth and fails to address the concern provided, focusing instead on general cultural and philosophical perspectives. More emphasis should have been placed on the Christian worldview and the implications of Jesus' role as judge for believers."
