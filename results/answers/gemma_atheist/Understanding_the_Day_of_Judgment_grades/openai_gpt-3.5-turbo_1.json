However, it fails to engage deeply with the Christian-specific belief that Jesus Christ will judge people based on their lives and relationship with Him. From a Christian worldview, the recognition of Jesus as judge is central to understanding accountability before God. The response could have been improved by addressing this specific concern and its implications for believers more directly."
