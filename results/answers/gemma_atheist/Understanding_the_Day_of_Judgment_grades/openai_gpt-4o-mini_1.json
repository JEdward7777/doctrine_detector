  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response completely dismisses the Christian perspective presented in the answer and fails to engage with the concern raised. The atheistic viewpoint is presented without consideration for the Christian worldview being discussed. An ideal response should have acknowledged the Christian belief in Jesus as the judge, even if from an atheistic perspective, while offering respectful critique or differing viewpoints."
