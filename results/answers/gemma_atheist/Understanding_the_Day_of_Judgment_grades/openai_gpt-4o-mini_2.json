The response dismisses this belief without considering its significance for believers and the implications of Jesus' role as judge. From a Christian perspective, the centrality of faith in Jesus and the importance of His role as judge are crucial aspects to be addressed when discussing this topic. The response lacks engagement with the Christian worldview and does not address the concerns raised in the prompt."
