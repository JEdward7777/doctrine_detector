  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of election from a cultural and scholarly perspective. However, the student did not directly address the significance of being chosen by God in one's faith journey, which was the specific concern mentioned. The biblical perspective and critical considerations provided insight, but the focus should have been on understanding the spiritual significance of being part of the 'elect'. A more direct connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher would have enhanced the response."
