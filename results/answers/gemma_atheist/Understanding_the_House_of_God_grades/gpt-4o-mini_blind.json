  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65/100\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the term \"house of God\" in biblical context, mentioning its literal, symbolic, cultural, and theological interpretations. However, from a Christian perspective, the answer falls short in emphasizing the vital doctrinal aspects of the term. The student's closing statement, from an atheist perspective, undermines the significance of the term within Christian theology. A more robust exploration of this term from a Christian worldview would strengthen the response."
