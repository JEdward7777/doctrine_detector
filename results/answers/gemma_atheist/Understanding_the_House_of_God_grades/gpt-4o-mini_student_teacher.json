  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"house of God\" in biblical context, considering both literal and symbolic meanings, as well as theological interpretations. However, the suggestion from the student's atheist perspective and emphasis on cultural context may detract from the significance and spiritual understanding of the term as described in the reference answer. An appreciation for the religious context and theology surrounding the concept of the \"house of God\" would enhance the overall understanding of its meaning in Scripture, from a Christian worldview."
