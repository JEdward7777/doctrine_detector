  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical concepts and their cultural context. \n\nThe student provides multiple interpretations of the \"house of God\" including its literal, symbolic, and theological significance. \n\nWhile the student's atheist perspective and concern for cultural context is acknowledged, the answer still aligns with the traditional Christian understanding of the term.\n\nHowever, a stronger connection to the teacher's reference answer could have been made by explicitly mentioning the tabernacle or the temple as physical structures associated with God's worship."
