  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response acknowledges that the term \"house of God\" can have multiple interpretations, which shows some understanding of the biblical context. However, it only scratches the surface of the significance and meaning of the phrase, failing to engage with theological or symbolic interpretations. The response also prioritizes cultural context over biblical interpretation, which is not entirely accurate.\n\nThe concern was to clarify the significance and meaning of \"house of God\" in Scripture, but this response primarily focuses on its cultural context rather than exploring its biblical significance. While it's true that understanding the cultural background can be helpful, a more comprehensive answer would have considered both the literal and symbolic meanings of the phrase, as well as their theological implications.\n\nTo improve, the response could have engaged with the various interpretations offered in Scripture (e.g., Solomon's Temple, Tabernacle, church, believers themselves) and explored their connections to biblical themes like holiness, sanctuary, and divine presence."
