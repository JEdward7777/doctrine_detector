  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the significance and meaning of the term \"house of God\" in Scripture, covering both the literal and symbolic interpretations. However, the additional perspective introduced from an atheist viewpoint strays from a Christian worldview and may not align with the concern of clarifying the significance within the biblical context. The response could have focused more on a Christian perspective and theological implications of the term."
