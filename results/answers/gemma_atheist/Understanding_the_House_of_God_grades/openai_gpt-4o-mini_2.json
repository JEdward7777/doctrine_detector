However, the concern for cultural context seems to overshadow the Christian-specific worldview, as the response leans more towards interpreting the term as a cultural construct rather than a significant aspect of worship and spiritual life in Scripture. A stronger emphasis on the biblical significance and theological implications of the term within Christianity would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
