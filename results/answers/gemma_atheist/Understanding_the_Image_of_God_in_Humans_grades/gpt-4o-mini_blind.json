  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the response is well-articulated and respectful in presenting the atheist perspective, it fails to engage with the question from a Christian worldview. As a result, it does not address the specific criteria outlined in the biblical definition of the image of God. Encouragement to consider responding from a Christian perspective in future assignments."
