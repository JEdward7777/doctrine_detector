  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the context and perspective of the question, which is centered around the biblical definition of the image of God. Since the student's response does not engage with this specific worldview and fails to address the question as intended, it receives a low grade. It's important for students to understand and respect the context of the question being asked, even if it differs from their own beliefs."
