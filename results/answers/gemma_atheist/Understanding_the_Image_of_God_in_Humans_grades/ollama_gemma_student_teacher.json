  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful consideration of the question from their atheist perspective. They clearly articulate their disbelief in the biblical definition of the image of God and offer an alternative approach based on empirical evidence, philosophical inquiry, and cultural analysis. While their answer may not align with the teacher's Christian worldview, it displays a deep understanding of the human condition and the nature of human characteristics."
