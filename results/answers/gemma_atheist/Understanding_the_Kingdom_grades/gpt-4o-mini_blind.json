  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the term \"kingdom of God\" in the New Testament, covering cultural context, eschatological hope, supernatural realm, transformation of hearts and minds, social implications, symbolic representation, and universal scope. The student effectively connects the concept of the \"kingdom of God\" to the broader themes of Christian faith. However, the student could enhance their response by incorporating more direct references to specific Bible verses that illustrate and support each point made. Overall, a strong answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
