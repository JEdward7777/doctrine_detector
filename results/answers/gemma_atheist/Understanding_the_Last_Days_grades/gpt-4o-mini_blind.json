  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55/100\n\nComments:\n1. The answer lacks a clear foundation on Biblical teachings regarding the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings. It presents more of a speculative and subjective interpretation rather than grounding the response in scriptural principles.\n2. The mention of cultural and literary understandings is valid to an extent but should be secondary to the theological significance attributed to the \"last days\" in Christian eschatology.\n3. The student's explanation of the first and second comings lacks doctrinal depth and clarity. They need to integrate key Biblical passages and teachings to provide a more robust and accurate analysis.\n4. The inclusion of potential concerns and culturally attributed interpretations is relevant, but the focus should primarily be on conveying a sound theological understanding of the topic.\n5. Encourage the student to delve deeper into scriptural references on the \"last days\" and the first and second comings of Jesus in their future responses to enhance theological accuracy and coherence."
