  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the concept of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings, considering various interpretations and implications. However, the answer strayed from a Christian-specific worldview by predominantly focusing on cultural and literary understandings, symbolisms, and potential concerns, without directly addressing the reference answer provided by the teacher. The discussion lacked a clear affirmation or rebuttal of the biblical timeline and significance. The student could improve by integrating more direct references to the reference answer and emphasizing the biblical perspective on the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' comings."
