  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise overview of the concept of \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings, touching on various interpretations and concerns. The discussion covers both the cultural and literary context of Jesus' first coming as well as the nuances surrounding his second coming. Additionally, it addresses potential concerns such as literal interpretations generating fear and anxiety.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the biblical events and their implications for Christian faith. While it provides a good overview of the concept, it does not explicitly connect the dots between Jesus' first and second comings, the timeline of major Biblical events, and its significance for Christian faith. A more detailed exploration of these connections would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the response is well-structured, informative, and thought-provoking, making it a strong effort that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
