However, it falls short of directly addressing the concern regarding understanding the timeline of major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of the \"last days\" to the timeline of major Biblical events and emphasizing its importance for Christian faith."
