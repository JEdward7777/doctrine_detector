  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed exploration of the significance of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings from a broader cultural and literary perspective. However, it lacks a direct connection to the given answer, which clearly states the timeline and significance of the \"last days\" as beginning with Jesus' first coming and ending with His second coming. The concern regarding understanding the timeline of major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith is not fully addressed in the response. The perspective presented may align with some modern scholarly interpretations but could benefit from more explicitly tying back to the given answer and concern provided."
