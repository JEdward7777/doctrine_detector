Comment: The response shows a solid understanding of the Old Testament laws by correctly identifying the Law of Moses, mentioning the categories of laws it encompasses, and specifying the target audience (Israelites). The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the relevance of these laws today. The only improvement would be to provide examples or further explanations to demonstrate a deeper understanding of how these laws continue to impact Christian beliefs and practices.
