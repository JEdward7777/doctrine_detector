However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies and omissions. The student should have clearly highlighted that the human spirit is created by God and inherently good but tainted by sin, while evil spirits are rebellious angels who oppose God. The discussion on modern interpretations should have emphasized the importance of upholding biblical truths rather than accommodating contemporary perspectives that deviate from Scripture. Additionally, a more thorough examination of the roles and influences of the human spirit versus evil spirits in a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
