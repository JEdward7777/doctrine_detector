## Answer given by [gemma atheist](../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
The traditional biblical interpretation of the Tabernacle suggests it served as a portable sanctuary where the Israelites could encounter and worship a transcendent deity. However, this interpretation is problematic from an atheistic perspective.

Considering the cultural and historical context of the Israelites in the desert, the Tabernacle likely functioned as a symbol of their collective identity and a place for ritual and social gatherings. The elaborate construction and meticulous rituals associated with the Tabernacle could have served mnemonic purposes, reminding the Israelites of their covenant with a divine power.

From a secular standpoint, the Tabernacle can be seen as a social and cultural phenomenon that evolved in response to the unique challenges faced by the Israelites during their nomadic existence. Its significance lies in the role it played in shaping their collective identity and providing a sense of continuity and belonging.
