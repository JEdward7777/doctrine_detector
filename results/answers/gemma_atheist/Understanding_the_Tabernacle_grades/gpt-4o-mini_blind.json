  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response neglects the foundational theological purpose of the Tabernacle for the Israelites as a place of worship and encounter with the living God, focusing instead on a secular interpretation. The student should have mentioned the significance of the Tabernacle in facilitating sacrifices, symbolizing God's presence among His people, and pointing towards Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the sanctuary. The response lacks doctrinal correctness in discussing the Tabernacle's primary function according to biblical principles."
