However, the response primarily focuses on a secular perspective, downplaying the significance of the Tabernacle in the Israelites' relationship with God. It fails to fully address the concern about understanding the role of the Tabernacle in the Israelites' relationship with God from a Christian worldview. More emphasis on the theological and spiritual significance of the Tabernacle in facilitating the Israelites' connection with God would have strengthened the response."
