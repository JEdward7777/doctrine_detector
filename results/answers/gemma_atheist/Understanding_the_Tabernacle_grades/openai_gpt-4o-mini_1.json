The perspective presented lacks a recognition of the Tabernacle's central role in the Israelites' relationship with God, which is a key concern in understanding its purpose and meaning in the biblical narrative. Furthermore, the response does not engage with the concept of divine instruction for the Tabernacle's construction, which is essential in understanding its symbolic and spiritual significance."
