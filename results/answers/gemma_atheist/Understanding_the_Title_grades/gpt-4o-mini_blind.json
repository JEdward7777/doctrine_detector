  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-researched analysis of the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus' identity. They have explored various biblical interpretations, cultural contexts, and even included an atheological perspective. However, from a Christian worldview, some interpretations mentioned (such as \"Cosmic Son\" and \"Human Son\") veer into speculative or heterodox territory that could be misleading. It would be beneficial for the student to focus more on interpretations that align with traditional biblical teachings to improve their grade."
