However, the student missed the key Christian-specific aspect of Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is crucial to understanding the significance of His self-identification as the 'Son of Man' in the Christian faith. The answer would benefit from a stronger emphasis on this central Christian doctrine."
