However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" and its implications for our faith.\n\nWhile the response correctly identifies the title's connection to humanity, it does not adequately explore its messianic and cosmic implications. The answer provided is relatively straightforward, emphasizing Jesus' dual nature without delving deeper into the cultural and theological nuances that make this title significant.\n\nTo improve, I would suggest providing more specific examples of how Jesus' identification as the \"Son of Man\" impacted his ministry, teachings, and interactions with others. Additionally, exploring the theological implications for our faith, such as its connection to salvation, redemption, or humanity's relationship with God, would strengthen the response."
