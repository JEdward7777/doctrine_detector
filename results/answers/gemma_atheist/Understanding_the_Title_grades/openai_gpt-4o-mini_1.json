It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' and its implications for faith from various angles. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian beliefs and effectively connects the theological significance of this title to deeper implications for faith. Well done!"
