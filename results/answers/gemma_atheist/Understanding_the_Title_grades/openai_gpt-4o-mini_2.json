The integration of scholarly interpretations, ancient Near Eastern beliefs, and Jewish perspectives enriches the discussion. The atheological perspective is considered, though a deeper exploration of how this viewpoint aligns or conflicts with a Christian worldview could enhance the analysis. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern by delving into the implications of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' for our faith."
