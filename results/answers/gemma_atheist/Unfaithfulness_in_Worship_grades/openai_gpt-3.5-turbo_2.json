The consideration of selective textual preservation, religious conflicts, and societal changes adds depth to the discussion. However, there could have been more explicit connections made to the implications of unfaithfulness in the believer's relationship with God from a Christian worldview perspective. Integrating more theological reflection on the consequences of unfaithfulness in light of God's commands and expectations would enhance the response."
