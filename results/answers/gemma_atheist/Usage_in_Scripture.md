## Usage of "Holy One" in the Old and New Testaments:

**Old Testament:**

* **Psalms 89:7:** "I will tell of the decree of the Lord: He said, 'You are my Son, today I have begotten you.' Therefore I call you 'My Son,' my beloved Son." (NRSV) - This verse implies divinity for the Son, but interpretations vary.
* **Daniel 7:13:** "I saw in the clouds one like a son of man; and there was a Son of Man like a son of man; and upon him was the dominion of heaven and earth." (NRSV) - This verse clearly identifies the Son as divine.
* **Other instances:** The term "Holy One" is used metaphorically for righteous individuals or leaders.

**New Testament:**

* **Throughout:** The term "Holy One" is primarily used for Jesus Christ, presenting him as the divine Son of God.
* **John 1:4:** "In him was life, and the life was the light of men." (NRSV) - This verse emphasizes Jesus' divine nature.
* **Other instances:** References to Jesus as the "Holy One" are found throughout the New Testament, particularly in prayers, prophecies, and theological writings.

**Cultural Considerations:**

* The use of "Holy One" carries cultural and religious significance within the biblical context.
