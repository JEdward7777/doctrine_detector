The references to Psalms 89:7 and Daniel 7:13 in the Old Testament are relevant, emphasizing the divine nature of the Son. However, the mention of potential interpretations regarding Psalm 89:7 could have been clarified with a more focused doctrinal perspective. Additionally, while the student acknowledges the cultural significance of the term, integrating a stronger doctrinal analysis and theological reflection on the concept of holiness and its implications in these contexts would have strengthened the response further. Consideration of how the term \"Holy One\" reflects God's purity, separateness, and sacredness would deepen the Biblical understanding."
