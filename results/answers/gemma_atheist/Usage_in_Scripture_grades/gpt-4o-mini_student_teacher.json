  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has shown a strong understanding of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments, providing relevant verses and explanations. However, the answer lacks a direct engagement with the concern of exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament. The student could have delved deeper into how the term \"Holy One\" specifically reflects Jesus' divinity and authority in the New Testament to align more closely with the provided concern."
