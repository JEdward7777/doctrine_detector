The concern was to explore the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which is only partially addressed by stating that it specifically refers to Jesus as the \"Holy One.\" The response would benefit from more detailed examples and analysis of how the term relates to Jesus' divine nature and authority.\n\nThe Old Testament examples provided are relevant, but they could be expanded upon. Additionally, the response does not fully engage with the concern's focus on Jesus' divinity in the New Testament."
