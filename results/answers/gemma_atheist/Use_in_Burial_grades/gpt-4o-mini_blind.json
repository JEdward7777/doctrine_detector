The student correctly mentions myrrh as a fragrant embalming resin and its cultural significance in preserving the body for the afterlife. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly referencing biblical examples or specific verses that mention myrrh in burial contexts. Additionally, emphasizing the symbolic or spiritual significance of myrrh in the Christian tradition could have further enriched the answer from a Christian-specific worldview."
