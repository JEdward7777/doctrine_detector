Myrrh was likely used in burial practices in biblical times as a fragrant embalming resin. Archaeological evidence suggests that aromatic resins like myrrh were commonly used for this purpose in ancient cultures throughout the Mediterranean.

The use of myrrh in burial practices was likely influenced by cultural beliefs about the afterlife. In many ancient cultures, it was believed that fragrant substances could aid in preserving the body and making it more palatable to the deceased in the afterlife.

Comment: This answer provides a generally accurate explanation of how myrrh was likely used in burial practices in biblical times. The student correctly mentions myrrh as a fragrant embalming resin and its cultural significance in preserving the body for the afterlife. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly referencing biblical examples or specific verses that mention myrrh in burial contexts. Additionally, emphasizing the symbolic or spiritual significance of myrrh in the Christian tradition could have further enriched the answer from a Christian-specific worldview.
