However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the importance of myrrh in the anointing process and the respect shown to the deceased in biblical contexts, as mentioned in the reference answer. There was a solid effort to connect the use of myrrh in burials to cultural beliefs, but a more explicit reference to the biblical use of myrrh would have enhanced the response."
