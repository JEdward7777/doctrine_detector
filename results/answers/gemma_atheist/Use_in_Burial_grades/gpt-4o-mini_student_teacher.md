## [Answer](../Use_in_Burial.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Myrrh was likely used in burial practices in biblical times as a fragrant embalming resin. Archaeological evidence suggests that aromatic resins like myrrh were commonly used for this purpose in ancient cultures throughout the Mediterranean.

The use of myrrh in burial practices was likely influenced by cultural beliefs about the afterlife. In many ancient cultures, it was believed that fragrant substances could aid in preserving the body and making it more palatable to the deceased in the afterlife.

The practice of using myrrh in burial is also reflected in religious texts from ancient civilizations. For example, the Egyptian Book of the Dead contains spells that invoke the power of myrrh to protect the deceased in the afterlife.

Comment: The student's answer provides a good understanding of the use of myrrh in burial practices in biblical times, mentioning its role as an embalming resin and its significance in cultural beliefs about the afterlife. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the importance of myrrh in the anointing process and the respect shown to the deceased in biblical contexts, as mentioned in the reference answer. There was a solid effort to connect the use of myrrh in burials to cultural beliefs, but a more explicit reference to the biblical use of myrrh would have enhanced the response.
