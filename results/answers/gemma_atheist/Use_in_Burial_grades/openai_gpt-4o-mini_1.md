Myrrh was likely used in burial practices in biblical times as a fragrant embalming resin. Archaeological evidence suggests that aromatic resins like myrrh were commonly used for this purpose in ancient cultures throughout the Mediterranean.

The use of myrrh in burial practices was likely influenced by cultural beliefs about the afterlife. In many ancient cultures, it was believed that fragrant substances could aid in preserving the body and making it more palatable to the deceased in the afterlife.
