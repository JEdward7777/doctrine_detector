Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus were referred to as "Rabbi" in any of the canonical texts. The title "Rabbi" was primarily used for teachers of Jewish law in that era. While both figures were respected and revered, their teachings did not align with the formal rabbinic framework of their time.

Comment: The response correctly states that neither John the Baptist nor Jesus were referred to as "Rabbi" in the canonical texts and provides a good explanation for the context of the title "Rabbi." However, the response could be improved by mentioning that Jesus was sometimes addressed as "Rabbi" in a respectful manner by his disciples and followers in non-canonical texts, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective.
