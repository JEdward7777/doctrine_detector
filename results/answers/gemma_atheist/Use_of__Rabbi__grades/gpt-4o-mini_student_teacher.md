## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus were referred to as "Rabbi" in any of the canonical texts. The title "Rabbi" was primarily used for teachers of Jewish law in that era. While both figures were respected and revered, their teachings did not align with the formal rabbinic framework of their time.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student correctly identified that the title "Rabbi" was primarily used for teachers in that era and acknowledged the respect and reverence towards both John the Baptist and Jesus. However, the student's answer missed the important point that both figures were sometimes referred to as "Rabbi" by their disciples, indicating their roles as teachers. This oversight led to a lack of fully recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings from a Christian worldview.
