Recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings.

## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus were referred to as "Rabbi" in any of the canonical texts. The title "Rabbi" was primarily used for teachers of Jewish law in that era. While both figures were respected and revered, their teachings did not align with the formal rabbinic framework of their time.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and the formal use of the title "Rabbi" in that era. However, it lacks sufficient textual evidence or specific references to support the claim that neither John nor Jesus were officially called "Rabbi" in the canonical texts. The reference answer provided indicates that such a title was used by their followers, which should have been included in the student's response.
