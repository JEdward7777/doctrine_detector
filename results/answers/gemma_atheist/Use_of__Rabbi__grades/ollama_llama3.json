  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges that neither Jesus nor John the Baptist was referred to as \"Rabbi\" in canonical texts, it incorrectly states that they were called \"Rabbi\" by their disciples. This is not supported by any biblical evidence. The response also fails to recognize the concern about respecting and acknowledging the authority of Jesus' and John's teachings.\n\nA more accurate response would acknowledge the limitations of using the title \"Rabbi\" in a Jewish context, while still recognizing the respect and authority associated with their teachings."
