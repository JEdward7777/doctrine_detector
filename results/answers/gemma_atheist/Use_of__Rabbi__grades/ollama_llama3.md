## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus were referred to as "Rabbi" in any of the canonical texts. The title "Rabbi" was primarily used for teachers of Jewish law in that era. While both figures were respected and revered, their teachings did not align with the formal rabbinic framework of their time.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
40.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 40.

While the response acknowledges that neither Jesus nor John the Baptist was referred to as "Rabbi" in canonical texts, it incorrectly states that they were called "Rabbi" by their disciples. This is not supported by any biblical evidence. The response also fails to recognize the concern about respecting and acknowledging the authority of Jesus' and John's teachings.

A more accurate response would acknowledge the limitations of using the title "Rabbi" in a Jewish context, while still recognizing the respect and authority associated with their teachings.
