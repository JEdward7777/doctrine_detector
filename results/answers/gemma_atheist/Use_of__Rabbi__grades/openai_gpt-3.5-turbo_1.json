However, the response fails to address the concern about recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. In a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the reverence and authority that Jesus and John held as divine figures, beyond just being recognized as teachers. More emphasis on their unique positions as key figures in Christianity would have strengthened the response."
