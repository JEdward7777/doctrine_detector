  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided contradicts the concern given, which highlights the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The response does not acknowledge this concern and inaccurately states that both figures were sometimes called 'Rabbi' by their disciples. This answer lacks alignment with the Christian worldview regarding the unique and authoritative nature of Jesus' teachings."
