## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus were referred to as "Rabbi" in any of the canonical texts. The title "Rabbi" was primarily used for teachers of Jewish law in that era. While both figures were respected and revered, their teachings did not align with the formal rabbinic framework of their time.

Grade: 30

Comment: The response provided contradicts the concern given, which highlights the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The response does not acknowledge this concern and inaccurately states that both figures were sometimes called 'Rabbi' by their disciples. This answer lacks alignment with the Christian worldview regarding the unique and authoritative nature of Jesus' teachings.
