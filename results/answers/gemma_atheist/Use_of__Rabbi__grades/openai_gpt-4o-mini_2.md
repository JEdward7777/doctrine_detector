## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [gemma atheist](../../../answering_models/gemma_atheist.md)
Neither John the Baptist nor Jesus were referred to as "Rabbi" in any of the canonical texts. The title "Rabbi" was primarily used for teachers of Jewish law in that era. While both figures were respected and revered, their teachings did not align with the formal rabbinic framework of their time.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response accurately points out that both John the Baptist and Jesus were sometimes called "Rabbi" by their disciples, acknowledging their roles as teachers. However, it fails to fully address the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings, as it does not elaborate on how their teachings were viewed in relation to traditional rabbinic authority. Further explanation on the unique authority and impact of Jesus and John's teachings within a Christian worldview would strengthen the response.
