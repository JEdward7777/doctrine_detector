However, from a Christian perspective, it is essential to uphold the scriptural use of 'Father' to refer to God as revealed in the Bible by Jesus Christ. While cultural sensitivities are important, doctrinal correctness should not be compromised. The response could have emphasized the significance of the term 'Father' in Christian theology and the understanding of God's relationship with believers as His children."
