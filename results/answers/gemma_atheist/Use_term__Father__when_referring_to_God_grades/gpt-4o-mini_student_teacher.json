  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides thoughtful alternatives and considerations for using alternative terminology for God, it diverges significantly from the Christian worldview. In Christianity, referring to God as 'Father' is deeply rooted in Scripture and theological understanding, emphasizing the relationship between God and His creation. Avoiding the term 'Father' could indeed lead to theological inaccuracies and dilute the scriptural message, as mentioned in the concern. The student's suggestions, while valid in a broader cultural context, do not align with the specific Christian perspective provided in the reference answer."
