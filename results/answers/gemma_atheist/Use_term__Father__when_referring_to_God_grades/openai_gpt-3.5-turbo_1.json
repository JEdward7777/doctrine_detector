As a Christian, God is often referred to as 'Father' in the Bible, which reflects the relationship believers have with Him. While considering inclusivity and respecting diverse perspectives is important, diluting the scriptural message and theological accuracy for the sake of cultural sensitivity is not in line with Christian beliefs. It is crucial to uphold the foundational truths of the faith even in cross-cultural dialogue."
