However, it does not directly address the concern that avoiding the term 'Father' could potentially lead to theological inaccuracies and dilute the scriptural message. While promoting inclusivity and respect for diverse backgrounds is valuable, ensuring theological integrity should also be a priority in discussing the concept of God as 'Father' within a Christian worldview. More explicit engagement with the concern raised would strengthen the response."
