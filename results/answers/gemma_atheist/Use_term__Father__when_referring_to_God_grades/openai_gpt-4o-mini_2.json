From a Christian worldview, maintaining the use of 'Father' as a term for God is important due to its biblical and theological significance, emphasizing the relational aspect of God as Father. It is vital to uphold scriptural truths even in the face of cultural challenges, rather than compromising on foundational beliefs for the sake of inclusivity."
