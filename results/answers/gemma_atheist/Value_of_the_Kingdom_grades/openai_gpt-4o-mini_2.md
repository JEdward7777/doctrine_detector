Comment: The response effectively brings out the value and significance of the kingdom of God by referencing the parables Jesus used to illustrate its worth. The concern of appreciating the kingdom of God is adequately addressed with relevant examples from Christian teachings. However, there could have been a more direct connection to how these teachings impact our lives and why they are essential for believers. Overall, a strong response with room for further elaboration on personal application.
