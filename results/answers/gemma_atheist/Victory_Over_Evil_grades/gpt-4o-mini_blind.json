  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComments: While the student acknowledged their atheist perspective, they did not engage with the question in the context in which it was asked. From a Christian worldview, it is important to understand and respect the beliefs of others, even when they differ from our own. In this case, the student could have responded by acknowledging the Christian belief in God and Satan, and then simply stating their lack of knowledge on the specific promise regarding Satan's ultimate defeat. This would have shown more respect for the question and the worldview from which it originated."
