  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student demonstrates a clear understanding of the atheist perspective and articulates it well. However, the answer lacks engagement with the Christian-specific worldview and fails to address the specific concern regarding the implications of Christ's victory for believers. The student's refusal to entertain the existence of supernatural entities limits the scope of their analysis and prevents them from offering any insights relevant to the question from the Christian perspective."
