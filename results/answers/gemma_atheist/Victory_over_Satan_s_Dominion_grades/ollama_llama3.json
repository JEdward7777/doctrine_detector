The response largely focuses on the scholar's personal worldview and limitations, which is understandable given the context. However, as the concern asks to explore the implications of Christ's victory for believers and its influence on their spiritual life, the response falls short in addressing this aspect. To improve, the response could delve deeper into the biblical teachings and provide examples or reflections on how Jesus' victory affects believers' daily lives and spiritual journeys."
