From a Christian worldview, it is important to acknowledge and understand the spiritual implications of Jesus' victory over sin and evil, which directly impacts believers and their spiritual life. This response shows a lack of consideration for the Christian perspective and misses the opportunity to explore this important aspect of faith."
