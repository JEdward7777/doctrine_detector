**From an atheistic scholar's perspective:**

The significance of Jesus' death on the cross concerning Satan's dominion is not a concept that aligns with my understanding of the universe. My worldview excludes the existence of supernatural entities like Satan or deities.

The concept of Jesus' sacrifice and its impact on spiritual realms is a religious belief that is deeply rooted in Christianity and has cultural significance within that framework. However, it is not a concept that holds weight in my analysis of human history and culture.

Therefore, I am unable to provide any insights or interpretations regarding the relationship between Jesus' death and Satan's dominion.
