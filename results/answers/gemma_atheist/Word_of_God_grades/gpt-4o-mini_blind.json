  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained answer regarding the term \"Word of God\" according to the Bible. They have correctly identified the spoken word, written word, incarnate word, universal word, and transforming word aspects of the Word of God. However, the concerns regarding cultural retribution mentioned at the end of the response are not directly related to the question and seem out of place in the context of defining the term \"Word of God\" according to the Bible from a Christian worldview. This portion could be omitted for better focus and relevance."
