However, the concerns raised by the atheist scholar regarding cultural nuances and interpretations of the Word of God were not addressed in the response, which is a crucial aspect to consider when discussing the scope and significance of God's communication. Nonetheless, the student's knowledge and explanation of the term 'Word of God' from a Christian perspective deserve recognition."
