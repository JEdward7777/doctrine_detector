**Concerns Regarding Cultural Retribution:**

As an atheist scholar, I acknowledge the importance of addressing questions in a culturally nuanced way. While the Bible is a significant cultural artifact in many societies, it is important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about its applicability to other cultures or belief systems.

The interpretation and application of the Word of God may vary widely across different contexts and communities. It is essential to respect the diverse perspectives and interpretations of others.
