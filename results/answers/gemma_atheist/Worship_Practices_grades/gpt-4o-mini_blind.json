It misses the opportunity to discuss important aspects of Christian faith such as idolatry and the worship of false gods. The focus on avoiding debate and respecting diverse beliefs does not align with a solid Christian worldview. Encouraging thoughtful reflection on potential modern idols would have been more appropriate."
