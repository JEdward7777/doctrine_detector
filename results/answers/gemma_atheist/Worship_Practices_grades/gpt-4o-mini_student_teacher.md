Grade: 20

Comment: While it is important to respect diverse beliefs, the student failed to address the specific concern raised in the question regarding idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God. The answer did not align with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the need to prioritize a relationship with God above all else.
