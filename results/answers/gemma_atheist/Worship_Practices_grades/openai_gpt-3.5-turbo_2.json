  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies modern idols as things that can take precedence over a relationship with God, aligning well with Christian teachings. The concern provided emphasizes the importance for Christians to prioritize their devotion to God, which is foundational in Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is for not directly incorporating Christian theology or terminology in the response. Overall, a strong answer from a Christian perspective."
