Modern idols can include material possessions, wealth, careers, or personal ambitions that take precedence over a relationship with God.

It's important for Christians to examine their lives and ensure that they are not prioritizing anything above their devotion to God.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response touches on the Christian concept of modern idols and correctly emphasizes the importance of not prioritizing anything above one's devotion to God. However, the initial concern about avoiding theological or philosophical debates is not entirely aligned with a Christian worldview, as Christians are called to engage in discussions and reflections on their faith and beliefs in order to grow spiritually.
