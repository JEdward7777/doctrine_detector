However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of aligning zeal with the teachings of Jesus Christ, ensuring that it is guided by love, humility, and a desire for the salvation of souls. Additionally, it would be beneficial to highlight the potential dangers of misguided zeal leading to harm or division within the Church. Overall, a solid foundation but could use more emphasis on doctrinal correctness."
