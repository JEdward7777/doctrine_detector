The atonement lid is commonly referred to as the \"mercy seat\" in Christian theology, and it was a central part of the ark of the covenant in the Old Testament. The significance of the atonement lid lies in its representation of the place where God's presence would manifest, and where atonement for sin was made by the high priest on the Day of Atonement. The response demonstrates a lack of understanding of the biblical narrative and theological significance."
