  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer entirely missed the mark in understanding the symbolic significance of the atonement lid in the context of the ark of the covenant. The atonement lid, also known as the mercy seat, played a crucial role in representing God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament. The student's response lacked an understanding of the theological implications and symbolism associated with the atonement lid, thus resulting in a significantly low grade."
