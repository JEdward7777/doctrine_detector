  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 60/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a lack of awareness of the biblical accounts and fails to engage with the provided concern regarding the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement. While it is true that there is no historical or archaeological evidence for the atonement lid, the response does not acknowledge the symbolic significance of the object within the context of the Old Testament."
