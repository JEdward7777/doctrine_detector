  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 90. The original response correctly acknowledges the significance of the atonement lid (mercy seat) in representing God's mercy and the role it played in Old Testament sacrificial practices. The concern of understanding the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament was adequately addressed in the response. The deduction from a perfect score is due to the lack of expanding further on the theological implications of atonement and mercy in the Christian worldview."
