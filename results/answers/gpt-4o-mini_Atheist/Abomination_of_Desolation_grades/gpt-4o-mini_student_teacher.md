The "abomination of desolation" mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24:15 refers to a pivotal and highly symbolic event linked to the desecration of the Jewish Temple. This phrase originally appears in the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible and historically refers to a sacrilegious act that rendered the Temple unclean. In the context of Jesus' teaching, it is often interpreted as a prophetic warning pertaining to the dire circumstances that would precede the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE.

The term has been widely understood within both Jewish and Christian eschatology. For many believers, the "abomination of desolation" symbolizes the ultimate rebellion against God, often associated with oppressive forces or figures. In Jesus' words, it serves as a sign for the faithful, indicating a time of great tribulation and urging followers to be vigilant.

From a cultural perspective, the reference resonates with the Jewish community's historical experiences of oppression, destruction, and the longing for divine justice. For Christians, it connects to broader themes of prophecy, the end times, and the nature of faith in the face of trials.

In summary, the significance of the "abomination of desolation" is multi-layered, functioning as a warning, a symbol of desolation, and a call to faithfulness amid turmoil. Its interpretation can vary greatly depending on theological, historical, and cultural contexts.
