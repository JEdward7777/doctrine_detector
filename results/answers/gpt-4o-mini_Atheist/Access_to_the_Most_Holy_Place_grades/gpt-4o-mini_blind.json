  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the significance of the restriction on entering the Most Holy Place in ancient Israelite worship. The student effectively articulates the doctrinal reasons for this restriction, emphasizing divine holiness, mediation, cultural identity, and maintaining sacred order. The explanation is well-supported with references to the Hebrew Bible, particularly the book of Leviticus. The student could enhance the response by incorporating specific scriptural references to further strengthen the doctrinal foundation."
