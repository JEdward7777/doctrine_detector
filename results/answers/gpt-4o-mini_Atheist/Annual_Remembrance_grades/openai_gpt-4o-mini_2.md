## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year as a significant observance that commemorates their deliverance from slavery in Egypt, as described in the Book of Exodus. This annual celebration serves several key purposes:

1. **Remembrance**: The Passover recounts the pivotal event of the Exodus, where God spared the Israelite households during the tenth plague by passing over them when the firstborn of Egypt were struck down. This act of divine intervention is central to Jewish identity and heritage.

2. **Covenantal Significance**: The celebration reinforces the covenant between God and the Israelites. By observing Passover, they reaffirm their identity as God's chosen people and acknowledge their liberation and the laws given to them.

3. **Teaching and Transmission**: The practice of Passover includes rituals and the retelling of the Exodus story, ensuring that each generation learns about their history and the importance of freedom. This familial and communal aspect helps to strengthen social and cultural bonds among the Jewish people.

4. **Worship and Thanksgiving**: Passover is a time of worship, emphasizing gratitude to God for deliverance and for the gifts of freedom and community. The Seder meal and associated rituals highlight themes of hope, redemption, and divine faithfulness.

By instituting the annual observance of Passover, the Israelites create a structured framework for reflecting on their past and instilling a sense of purpose and identity in their present and future.
