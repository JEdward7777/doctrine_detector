  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of receiving the Holy Spirit through anointing within Christian theology. It correctly identifies anointing with oil as a symbolic practice signifying empowerment, sanctification, and divine presence. The connections made between empowerment for service, transformation, divine presence, healing, and community are well articulated. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more scriptural references to support the theological points made and strengthen the doctrinal foundation of the explanation."
