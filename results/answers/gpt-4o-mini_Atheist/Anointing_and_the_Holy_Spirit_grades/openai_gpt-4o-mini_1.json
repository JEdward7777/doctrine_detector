It effectively elaborates on how anointing symbolizes empowerment, sanctification, divine presence, healing, community, and unity, all of which contribute to the believer's service and guidance by the Holy Spirit. The explanation is clear, well-supported, and reflects a strong understanding of Christian theology."
