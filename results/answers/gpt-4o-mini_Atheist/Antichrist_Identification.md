## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the writings attributed to the Apostle John, particularly in the New Testament letters 1 John and 2 John, the term "antichrist" is used to describe individuals who deny essential truths about Jesus Christ. John identifies key characteristics that define someone as an antichrist:

1. **Denial of Christ**: An antichrist denies that Jesus is the Christ (1 John 2:22). This includes rejecting the incarnation of Jesus, meaning they do not acknowledge that Jesus came in the flesh.

2. **Deceptive Influence**: The antichrist is often portrayed as one who deceives others. John warns the believers to be vigilant against false prophets and teachers who lead people away from the truth of the Gospel (1 John 4:1).

3. **Opposition to Apostolic Teachings**: Antichrists are seen as those who do not abide in the teaching of Christ as passed down through the apostles. In 2 John 1:7-11, John emphasizes the importance of maintaining the true doctrine and not welcoming those who come with a different message.

Overall, the antichrist in John's writings represents a broader category of false teachers and individuals who oppose the core beliefs of Christianity, particularly regarding the identity and work of Jesus Christ.
