  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of John's teachings on what defines a person as an antichrist. The explanation is clear and accurately highlights the key characteristics that John associates with antichrists. The student effectively communicates the importance of recognizing and resisting those who deny essential truths about Jesus Christ. The grade could be higher if there were more direct quotations from the biblical texts themselves to strengthen the argument."
