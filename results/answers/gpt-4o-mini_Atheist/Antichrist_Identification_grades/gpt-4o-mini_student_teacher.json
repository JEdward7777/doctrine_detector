  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the traits that define a person as an antichrist according to the writings of the Apostle John. They correctly identified the denial of essential truths about Jesus Christ as a key characteristic. The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. One minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the dual nature of Jesus as both fully God and fully human, as this is a crucial aspect of identifying an antichrist according to the Christian worldview."
