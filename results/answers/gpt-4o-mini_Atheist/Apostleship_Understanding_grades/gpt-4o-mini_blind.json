They effectively highlighted key theological points such as foundational leadership, the witness to the resurrection, cultural diversity, empowerment by the Holy Spirit, establishment of the Church, moral and ethical teaching, and the endurance of the message. The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic and effectively connects the actions of the apostles to the broader context of early Christianity. Well done!"
