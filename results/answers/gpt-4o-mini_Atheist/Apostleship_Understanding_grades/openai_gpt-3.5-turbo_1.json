The integration of key theological concepts such as foundational leadership, witness to the resurrection, cultural diversity, empowerment by the Holy Spirit, establishment of the Church, moral and ethical teaching, and endurance of the message enriches the explanation and aligns well with a Christian worldview. The response effectively expands on the significance of the apostles' mission beyond mere preaching to encompass foundational, transformative, and enduring aspects of early Christianity."
