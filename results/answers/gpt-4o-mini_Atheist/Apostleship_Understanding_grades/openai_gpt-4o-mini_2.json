It effectively addresses the concern by exploring various aspects of apostleship, including leadership, witness to the resurrection, cultural diversity, empowerment by the Holy Spirit, establishment of the Church, moral and ethical teaching, and the endurance of the message. The Christian worldview is clearly reflected in the analysis, emphasizing the theological significance and historical impact of the apostles' mission in spreading the gospel. Well done!"
