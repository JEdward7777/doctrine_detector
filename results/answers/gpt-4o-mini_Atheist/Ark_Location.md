## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the ancient Israelite tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant was located in the innermost chamber known as the Holy of Holies (or Debir). This sacred space was separated from the rest of the tabernacle by a veil. The Ark itself was a gold-covered wooden box that contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments, among other sacred items. The Holy of Holies was considered the most sacred part of the tabernacle, as it was believed to be the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. Only the high priest was allowed to enter this chamber, and only once a year on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.
