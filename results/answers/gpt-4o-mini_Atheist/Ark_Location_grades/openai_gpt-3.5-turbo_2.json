It effectively demonstrates an understanding of the significance of the most holy place as the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. The mention of the high priest's exclusive access and the annual entry on Yom Kippur further enhances the depth of understanding regarding the sacredness of this space in the context of divine presence."
