The mention of the significance of the presence of God in the Holy of Holies and the restricted access only to the high priest on Yom Kippur demonstrates a good understanding of the sacredness and reverence associated with this space. However, to further enhance the response and demonstrate a deeper understanding from a Christian worldview, connecting the concept of the Holy of Holies to the idea of God's dwelling among His people in the Old Testament and the symbolism it holds in relation to Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity could have been beneficial."
