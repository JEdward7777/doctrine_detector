Romans 12:9 states, "Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good." This verse emphasizes the importance of authenticity in loveâ€”suggesting that our love should be sincere and free from pretense. To avoid hypocrisy in our love and actions, we should strive for honesty and integrity in our relationships and interactions.

Being genuine means that our feelings and intentions align with our actions.
