  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The answer provides a generally solid overview of the concept of divine authority and its significance in the life of a believer. The explanation covers key aspects such as moral framework, sense of purpose, community, coping mechanism, and framework for understanding reality. However, to elevate the grade, the student could have included more specific references to Christian doctrine, such as the ultimate divine authority of God as revealed in the Bible, the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate authority in a believer's life, and the importance of the Holy Spirit in guiding and empowering believers. By incorporating more explicitly Christian perspectives, the answer would align more closely with a Christian worldview."
