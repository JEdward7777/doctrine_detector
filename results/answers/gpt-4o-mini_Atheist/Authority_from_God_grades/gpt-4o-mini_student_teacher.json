  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of divine authority and its significance in the life of a believer, incorporating various aspects such as moral framework, sense of purpose, community and identity, coping mechanism, and framework for understanding reality. However, the student's answer lacks a clear reference to the specific Christian understanding of divine authority as the teacher's reference answer emphasizes. The explanation could have been strengthened by providing examples or references to Christian scripture or teachings to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
