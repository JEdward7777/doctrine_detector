## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible addresses the authority of governing rulers in several passages, reflecting a variety of contexts and viewpoints. One of the most frequently cited passages is Romans 13:1-7, where the Apostle Paul writes about the role of governing authorities. He asserts that all authority comes from God, and those in positions of power are considered to be instituted by Him. This passage emphasizes the idea that citizens should be subject to their rulers, as resisting authority is viewed as resisting God's ordinance.

Another significant reference is found in 1 Peter 2:13-17, where Peter encourages believers to submit to human authorities for the Lord's sake, whether to the emperor or governors. This passage highlights the importance of order and respect for leadership within the context of faith.

Conversely, there are also examples in the Bible where individuals challenge authority, especially when it conflicts with their moral or religious beliefs. The Hebrew midwives defied Pharaoh in Exodus 1:15-20, and Daniel and his three friends stood against the decrees of King Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel. These examples illustrate that while there is an emphasis on obedience to governmental authority, faith and moral considerations can lead to resistance against unjust laws or commands.

Overall, the biblical perspective on the authority of rulers is multifaceted, emphasizing submission and respect while also allowing for resistance in the face of injustice or moral obligations.
