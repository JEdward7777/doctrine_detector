  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a well-rounded overview of the biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers. They correctly reference key passages such as Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:13-17, emphasizing the importance of submission to authorities as ordained by God. However, the response could be strengthened by delving deeper into the theological underpinnings of governance and authority as outlined in the Bible. Additionally, a more explicit connection to overarching Christian principles of justice, righteousness, and the ultimate sovereignty of God would enrich the analysis."
