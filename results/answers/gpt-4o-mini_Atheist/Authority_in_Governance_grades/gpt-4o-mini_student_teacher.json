  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer discussing various biblical passages related to the authority of governing rulers. They correctly referenced Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:13-17 to highlight the importance of submitting to governmental authority. However, the student included examples of resistance to authority without clearly emphasizing the overarching biblical principle of submitting to governing rulers. The reference answer succinctly captures the central idea that governing rulers have authority established by God, which the student could have focused on more prominently."
