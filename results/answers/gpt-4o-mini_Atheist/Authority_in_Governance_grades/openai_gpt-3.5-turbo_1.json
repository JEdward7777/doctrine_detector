  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers, citing relevant passages such as Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2. It effectively addresses the concern about understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and the responsibility to obey by highlighting the concept that governing rulers are established by God and possess authority. The inclusion of examples of resistance against unjust authority from the Bible adds depth to the analysis. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on this topic."
