It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the establishment of authority by God and the responsibility to obey. The inclusion of examples where individuals challenge authority due to moral obligations adds depth to the discussion. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the God-ordained structure of authority and the balance between submission and righteous resistance in the biblical context."
