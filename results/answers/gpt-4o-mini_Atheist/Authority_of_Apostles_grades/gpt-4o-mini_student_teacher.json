  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provided a comprehensive explanation of the authority of the apostles in relation to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly, covering various dimensions such as divine commissioning, signs and wonders, spirit empowerment, covenantal context, community reception, and suffering and persecution. The student effectively connected these aspects to illustrate the authority and empowerment bestowed upon the apostles. However, the reference answer from the teacher provided a more concise and direct response to the question, focusing solely on the divine empowerment given to the apostles by God. The student's answer, while thorough and well-supported, could benefit from more direct alignment with the simplicity and clarity of the reference answer."
