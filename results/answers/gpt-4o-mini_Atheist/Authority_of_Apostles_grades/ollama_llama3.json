  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, going beyond just a simple statement about their empowerment. It presents a comprehensive view of the apostles' authority, highlighting six different dimensions: divine commissioning, signs and wonders, Spirit empowerment, covenantal context, community reception, and suffering and persecution. The response also does an excellent job of weaving together these different aspects to show how they all contributed to the apostles' authority.\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is in explicitly connecting the apostles' authority to their ability to preach boldly and perform miracles, as specified in the concern. While the response mentions this connection briefly, it could be more fully developed throughout the text.\n\nOverall, however, this response does an excellent job of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, making it a strong candidate for a high grade."
