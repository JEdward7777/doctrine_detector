  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the title \"King of the Jews\" in relation to Jesus' authority over all creation. The student effectively connects historical, theological, and cultural perspectives to illustrate the multifaceted nature of this title. The explanation of how Jesus' kingship extends beyond political dominion to encompass universal authority is particularly strong. The response could be strengthened by making more explicit connections to specific biblical passages or theological doctrines that support the points made. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful response."
