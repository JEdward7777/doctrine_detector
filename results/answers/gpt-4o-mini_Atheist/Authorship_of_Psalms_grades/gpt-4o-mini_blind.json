  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive overview of key figures traditionally associated with the authorship of the Psalms, acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the actual authorship of many psalms. The inclusion of key figures such as David, Asaph, the Sons of Korah, Solomon, and Moses is accurate and supported by biblical tradition. The explanation of the collaborative nature of the Psalms' authorship and their diverse theological and cultural contexts is well-stated. Good job overall."
