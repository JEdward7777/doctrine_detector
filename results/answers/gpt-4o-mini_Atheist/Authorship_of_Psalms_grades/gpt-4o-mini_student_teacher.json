  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response with a score of 85.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive list of key figures traditionally associated with the authorship of the Psalms and demonstrated a good understanding of the collaborative and diverse nature of the Psalms' authorship. However, the student's answer could have been improved by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the authorship of Psalms in enhancing the understanding of their messages and themes, as requested in the concern. Additionally, the student could have focused more on the key figures specifically mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, the response was detailed and informative, but it could have been more focused on the key figures highlighted in the reference answer to better address the concern provided."
