## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Book of Psalms is a collection of religious poems and songs found in the Hebrew Bible (or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible). While traditionally attributed to certain figures, the actual authorship of many psalms remains uncertain, and they likely reflect contributions from various writers over a significant period. Here are some key figures traditionally associated with the authorship of the Psalms:

1. **David**: King David is often credited with writing many of the psalms, particularly those that express themes of personal lament, gratitude, and worship. He is thought to have composed around half of the psalms.

2. **Asaph**: Asaph was a musician and a leader of the temple choir during King David's reign. Several psalms are attributed to him and the sons of Asaph, who were likely part of a musical guild.

3. **The Sons of Korah**: This group is known for writing several psalms. They were descended from Korah, a Levite who led a rebellion against Moses but whose descendants later assumed roles as temple singers.

4. **Solomon**: Some psalms are attributed to Solomon, David's son, who is known for his wisdom. Psalm 72 is often associated with him, reflecting royal themes.

5. **Moses**: Psalm 90 is attributed to Moses, marking one of the few psalms believed to originate from the time of the Exodus.

6. **Other Anonymous Writers**: Many psalms do not have specific authors listed and may reflect the voices of various individuals across different periods of Israelite history, including the Babylonian exile.

Overall, the Psalms encapsulate a wide range of human emotions and experiences and reflect diverse theological and cultural contexts within ancient Israel. The collaborative nature of their authorship underscores the communal aspect of worship and spirituality in that era.
