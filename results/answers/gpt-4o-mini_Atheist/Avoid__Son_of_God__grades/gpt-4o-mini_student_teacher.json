  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and well-reasoned answer, acknowledging the potential for misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures regarding the term \"Son of God.\" The student suggests using alternative phrasing and providing additional context to mitigate confusion, which demonstrates a sensitivity to cultural nuances. However, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes the importance of not avoiding the term entirely but rather teaching its true meaning through context and explanation. The student's answer aligns with a Christian worldview in terms of ensuring clarity and accuracy in conveying the divinity of Jesus, but could have emphasized more on the importance of teaching the true meaning of the term rather than avoiding it completely."
