  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response acknowledges that cultural and religious contexts can influence the interpretation of the term \"Son of God\" and proposes thoughtful approaches to translation, such as providing additional context or using alternative phrasing. It also recognizes the importance of engaging with local scholars and cultural leaders in the translation process.\n\nWhile the response does not explicitly address the concern about avoidance leading to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings, it implies that a careful and thoughtful approach can help prevent these issues. This aligns with the answer provided (\"No, the term should not be avoided; instead, its meaning should be carefully taught through context and explanation.\").\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have more directly addressed the concern about avoidance leading to misunderstandings. Nevertheless, the overall quality of the response and its thoughtful approach to translation earn it a score of 85."
