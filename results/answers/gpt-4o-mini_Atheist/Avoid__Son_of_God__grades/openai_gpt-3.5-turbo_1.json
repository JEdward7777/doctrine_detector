The student correctly emphasizes the importance of providing context and explanation to convey the true meaning of the term \"Son of God\" rather than avoiding it altogether. By suggesting alternative ways to elucidate the concept within different cultural contexts, the student demonstrates a strategic and sensitive approach to translation work. However, the response could have elaborated more on how to specifically convey the Christian understanding of Jesus' divinity without compromising theological accuracy, which would have further strengthened the argument."
