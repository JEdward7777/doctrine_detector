  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and balanced approach to the concern at hand, emphasizing the importance of careful teaching and explanation to avoid theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. The suggestion to provide additional context and explanations, while considering the audience and cultural implications in translation work, reflects a well-rounded Christian worldview perspective. The response could be strengthened by explicitly affirming the unique and divine nature of Jesus as the Son of God within the Christian faith."
