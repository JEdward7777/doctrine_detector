  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the different methods of baptism mentioned in the Bible and how they are interpreted in various Christian contexts. The inclusion of relevant biblical references supports the explanations. The student effectively discusses the doctrinal and theological differences among denominations regarding baptism methods. However, to enhance the response, the student could have emphasized more the significance of baptism in each method with regard to Christian beliefs on salvation and the Church. Additionally, connecting each method more explicitly with key doctrinal principles of Christian faith would have added depth to the analysis. Overall, a solid and informative answer."
