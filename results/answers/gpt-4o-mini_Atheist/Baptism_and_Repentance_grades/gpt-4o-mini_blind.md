## [Answer](../Baptism_and_Repentance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, repentance and baptism are closely linked, serving complementary roles in the process of spiritual transformation and entry into the Christian community.

1. **Repentance**: In the New Testament, especially in the teachings of John the Baptist and Jesus, repentance is presented as a vital response to God's call for a moral and spiritual turnaround. The Greek term for repentance, "metanoia," signifies a change of mind and heart, leading to a transformation in behavior and attitudes. For instance, in Matthew 4:17, Jesus begins his ministry by proclaiming, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."

2. **Baptism**: Baptism is depicted as an outward sign of an inward change — a public declaration of faith and commitment to follow Christ. John the Baptist initially baptizes those who repent as a symbolic act of cleansing and preparation for the coming of the Messiah (Matthew 3:6). After Jesus' resurrection, he commands his followers to baptize new disciples as a part of the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19).

3. **The Relationship Between the Two**: The New Testament illustrates that baptism follows repentance, indicating that a genuine change of heart is required before one enters the waters of baptism. Acts 2:38, for example, emphasizes this connection, where Peter calls the people to "repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins." This phrase suggests that repentance is a prerequisite for receiving baptism and the accompanying forgiveness of sins.

4. **Spiritual Significance**: Baptism is thus seen as a sacramental act that symbolizes and seals the repentance one has experienced. Romans 6:3-4 describes baptism as a participation in Jesus' death and resurrection, suggesting that it represents both a personal commitment to live a new life (following one’s repentance) and a communal entry into the body of Christ.

In summary, within the New Testament framework, repentance and baptism are intricately interwoven. Repentance serves as the necessary inner transformation that prepares an individual for baptism, which acts as a public affirmation of that change, signifying a new life dedicated to following the teachings of Jesus.
