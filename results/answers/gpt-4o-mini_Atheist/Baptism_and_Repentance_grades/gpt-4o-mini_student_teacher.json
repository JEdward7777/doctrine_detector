  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the relationship between repentance and baptism in the New Testament, citing relevant examples and demonstrating a depth of knowledge on the topic. However, the student's response was more detailed than necessary based on the given answer. The reference answer succinctly captures the essential point that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism, while the student's response delves deeper into the theological significance and nuances. This depth of explanation is commendable but slightly exceeds the scope of the question, making the answer slightly off-focus in addressing the specified concern."
