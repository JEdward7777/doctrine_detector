The writer provides clear examples from the New Testament to support their arguments, including John the Baptist's teachings, Jesus' ministry, and Peter's call to repent and be baptized.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the scriptural basis for the connection between repentance and baptism. While the writer mentions instances where individuals repented before being baptized, they do not explicitly explore the biblical passages that establish this relationship (e.g., Acts 2:38, Romans 6:3-4). Nevertheless, the response effectively summarizes the New Testament's depiction of repentance and baptism as interdependent processes."
