  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response with a score of 85.\n\nThe student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the Pharisees' beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings, referencing their belief in resurrection and the existence of angels and demons. The student also correctly points out the differences between the Pharisees and other Jewish groups, such as the Sadducees, in terms of these beliefs. The response demonstrates a good grasp of the topic and effectively explores how understanding these beliefs enhances our knowledge of the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could have been improved by being more concise and directly aligning with the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the additional details and explanations are informative, they slightly deviate from the specific focus of the question and concern provided. Nonetheless, the student has shown a solid understanding of the topic and provided a well-structured response."
