The student effectively references key passages such as Acts 6:1-7 and 1 Timothy 3:8-13 to support their explanation. The emphasis on the servant leadership role of deacons and their importance in supporting the overall ministry of the church demonstrates a solid understanding of biblical teachings on this topic. Well done!"
