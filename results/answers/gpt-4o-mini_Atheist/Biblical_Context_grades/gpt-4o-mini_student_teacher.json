  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of the origin, qualifications, and responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, their answer did not directly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as specifically outlined in the reference answer. The focus on logistical concerns and practical matters, although important, did not directly align with the concern of fair distribution of resources. Encouraging the student to connect the responsibilities of deacons with the concept of fair treatment and care would have strengthened their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
