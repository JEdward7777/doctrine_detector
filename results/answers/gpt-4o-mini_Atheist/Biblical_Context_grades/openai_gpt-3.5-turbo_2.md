## [Answer](../Biblical_Context.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The New Testament outlines the responsibilities of deacons primarily in the book of Acts and in the letters of Paul, particularly in 1 Timothy.

In **Acts 6:1-7**, we see the origin of the deacon role. The early church faced practical challenges, particularly related to the distribution of food to widows. The apostles recognized the need for dedicated individuals to handle these logistical concerns, which allowed them to focus on prayer and the ministry of the word. Therefore, they appointed seven men (often considered the first deacons) to oversee these tasks.

In **1 Timothy 3:8-13**, the qualifications and responsibilities of deacons are further elaborated. Paul writes that deacons should be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. They are expected to hold firmly to the faith and be tested before being appointed. Deacons are also described as having responsibilities that include managing their households well and serving the church diligently.

Overall, the New Testament presents deacons as servants of the church who assist in practical matters, allowing the apostles and elders to focus on teaching and leading the spiritual life of the community. Their role is integral to the functioning and growth of the church.
