  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned and detailed response, citing specific passages in the Bible that highlight Moses' humility. While Moses is indeed a prime example of humility in the Bible, the answer could have been more concise and directly addressed the concern by referencing the character of David as the teacher specified. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a good understanding of biblical principles related to humility."
