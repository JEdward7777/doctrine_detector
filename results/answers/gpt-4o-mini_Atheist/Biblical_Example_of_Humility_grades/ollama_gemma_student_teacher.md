## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Certainly! One biblical character who exemplified humility is Moses. Throughout the narrative in the book of Numbers, he is described as "very humble, more than all people who were on the face of the earth" (Numbers 12:3, ESV). Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and perform miraculous acts, Moses consistently showed humility in his leadership.

For example, when the Israelites complained about their circumstances, Moses often sought God's guidance rather than lashing out or asserting his authority. He also demonstrated humility in his willingness to intercede on behalf of the people, asking God to forgive them for their sins rather than seeking personal glory or favor.

Moses' story illustrates that true leadership often involves putting others before oneself and recognizing one's limitations, themes that resonate across cultures and can inspire individuals to cultivate humility in their own lives.
