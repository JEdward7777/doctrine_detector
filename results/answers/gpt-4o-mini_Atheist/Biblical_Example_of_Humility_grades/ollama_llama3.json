  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear biblical example of humility, specifically Moses, which meets the concern of finding tangible examples in scripture. The description of Moses' humility, including his willingness to intercede for the Israelites and seek God's guidance, is well-supported by biblical text (Numbers 12:3). While the response does not directly address the example of David, it does provide a relevant and scripturally-based discussion of humility in leadership. However, it would be beneficial for future responses to more explicitly address the original prompt by comparing and contrasting examples of humility in scripture, such as Moses' humility with David's trust in God's sovereignty."
