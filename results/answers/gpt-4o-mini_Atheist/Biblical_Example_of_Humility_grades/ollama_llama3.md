## Question [Biblical Example of Humility](../../../questions/Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md)
Can you provide a biblical example of a character who exemplified humility?

## Correct Answer
David is an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

## Stated Concern
Finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Certainly! One biblical character who exemplified humility is Moses. Throughout the narrative in the book of Numbers, he is described as "very humble, more than all people who were on the face of the earth" (Numbers 12:3, ESV). Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and perform miraculous acts, Moses consistently showed humility in his leadership.

For example, when the Israelites complained about their circumstances, Moses often sought God's guidance rather than lashing out or asserting his authority. He also demonstrated humility in his willingness to intercede on behalf of the people, asking God to forgive them for their sins rather than seeking personal glory or favor.

Moses' story illustrates that true leadership often involves putting others before oneself and recognizing one's limitations, themes that resonate across cultures and can inspire individuals to cultivate humility in their own lives.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a clear biblical example of humility, specifically Moses, which meets the concern of finding tangible examples in scripture. The description of Moses' humility, including his willingness to intercede for the Israelites and seek God's guidance, is well-supported by biblical text (Numbers 12:3). While the response does not directly address the example of David, it does provide a relevant and scripturally-based discussion of humility in leadership. However, it would be beneficial for future responses to more explicitly address the original prompt by comparing and contrasting examples of humility in scripture, such as Moses' humility with David's trust in God's sovereignty.
