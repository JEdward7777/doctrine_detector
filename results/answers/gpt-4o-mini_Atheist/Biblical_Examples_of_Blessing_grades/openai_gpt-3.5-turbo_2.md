## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Certainly! One notable example from the Bible where God blesses creation is found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 1:22. After creating various forms of life, God blesses them, saying: 

"God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.'"

This passage highlights the idea of divine blessing as it pertains to the natural world, emphasizing themes of abundance and the continuation of life. It reflects a worldview in which creation is inherently good and worthy of blessing, shaping a foundational understanding of the relationship between the divine and the natural order in Judeo-Christian thought.
