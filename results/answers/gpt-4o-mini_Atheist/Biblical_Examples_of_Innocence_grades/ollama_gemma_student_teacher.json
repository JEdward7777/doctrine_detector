  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thorough response that effectively analyzes the concept of innocence in the context of Jesus' trial and crucifixion, referencing relevant biblical passages. It clearly demonstrates an understanding of the Christian worldview and provides thoughtful interpretations of the texts. However, including the reference answer provided by the teacher would have strengthened the response by offering additional context and analysis."
