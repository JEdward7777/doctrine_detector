## Question [Biblical Examples of Innocence](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md)
Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

## Stated Concern
These examples serve to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.

Certainly! In exploring the theme of innocence in relation to Jesus and his accusers, several biblical passages can be highlighted. These passages underscore Jesus’ innocence in the face of false accusations and the unjust treatment he received.

1. **John 18:38** - During Jesus' trial, Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, states, "I find no guilt in him." This declaration emphasizes Pilate's recognition of Jesus' innocence amidst the charges brought against him.

2. **Luke 23:14-15** - Pilate asserts that he has examined Jesus and finds no basis for the charges against him, asserting, "Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. As you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death." This reinforces the theme of Jesus' innocence.

3. **Matthew 27:24** - Pilate symbolically washes his hands before the crowd, declaring himself innocent of Jesus' blood, indicating that he sees Jesus as innocent and is trying to distance himself from the decision to execute him.

4. **1 Peter 2:22** - This verse references Jesus, stating, "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth." This reflects the New Testament belief in Jesus' sinlessness and innocence.

5. **Luke 23:41** - While one of the criminals crucified alongside Jesus acknowledges their own wrongdoing, he contrasts it with Jesus, who "has done nothing wrong." This statement from a criminal in the same situation highlights the broader acknowledgment of Jesus' innocence.

These examples illustrate how the concept of innocence is articulated in the Scriptures, particularly in the context of Jesus’ trial and crucifixion. They reveal a significant theme of unjust suffering and provide a counter narrative to the wrongful accusations he faced.

**Comment:** This is a well-written and thorough response that effectively analyzes the concept of innocence in the context of Jesus' trial and crucifixion, referencing relevant biblical passages. It clearly demonstrates an understanding of the Christian worldview and provides thoughtful interpretations of the texts. However, including the reference answer provided by the teacher would have strengthened the response by offering additional context and analysis.
