  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response successfully provides multiple biblical passages that highlight Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations, which aligns with the concern to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm Jesus' innocence. The examples provided from John, Luke, Matthew, and 1 Peter are relevant and support the theme of Jesus' innocence.\n\nThe response is well-organized, and the writer effectively uses transitions between paragraphs to connect the different biblical passages. Additionally, the response provides a clear and concise summary at the end, which helps to reinforce the main point that these examples illustrate the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.\n\nOne area for improvement could be to more explicitly tie each biblical passage back to the concern. While the writer does an excellent job of highlighting the passages that affirm Jesus' innocence, a more direct connection between the passages and the concern would strengthen the response."
