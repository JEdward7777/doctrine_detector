  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical figures who expressed lament, highlighting their stories and the lessons that can be learned from their examples. They also drew out important themes such as vulnerability, community, empathy, and hope as key takeaways from these narratives. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more specifically on the aspect of honest communication with God and bringing sorrows before Him, which was the main concern highlighted by the teacher. Strengthening the connection between the biblical examples and their communication with God would have aligned the response more closely with the specified concern."
