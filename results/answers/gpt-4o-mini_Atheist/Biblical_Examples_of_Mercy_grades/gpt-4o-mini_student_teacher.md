## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Mercy.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible provides numerous examples that illustrate the concept of mercy. Here are a few key examples across both the Old and New Testaments:

1. **The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37)**: In this parable, Jesus tells the story of a Samaritan who helps a wounded traveler who has been ignored by others. The Samaritan's action exemplifies mercy as he risks his own safety and spends his resources to care for someone in need, regardless of their background or social status.

2. **The Parable of the Lost Sheep (Matthew 18:12-14)**: In this parable, Jesus describes a shepherd who leaves his ninety-nine sheep to find one that has gone astray. This act demonstrates God's mercy toward sinners and His willingness to seek out and reclaim those who are lost.

3. **The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32)**: In this story, a wayward son squanders his inheritance but is welcomed back by his father with open arms when he returns home. The father’s reaction embodies mercy, showcasing forgiveness and love despite the son’s reckless actions.

4. **The Woman Caught in Adultery (John 8:1-11)**: In this passage, Jesus intervenes when a woman is brought before Him for committing adultery. Rather than condemning her, He challenges her accusers and ultimately tells her to go and sin no more, demonstrating both mercy and the importance of personal transformation.

5. **David and Mephibosheth (2 Samuel 9)**: After King Saul’s death, David seeks out Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, to show him kindness for Jonathan's sake. He restores Mephibosheth’s lands and allows him to eat at the king’s table, illustrating mercy through loyalty and generosity.

6. **God’s Compassion in Psalms (Psalm 103:8-12)**: This Psalm speaks of God's character, emphasizing His merciful nature. It highlights that God is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving sins and removing transgressions as far as the east is from the west.

These examples resonate deeply with the core aspect of mercy—showing compassion and forgiveness, often in situations where judgment may seem justified. They reflect a broader ethical principle of valuing human dignity and the transformative power of kindness.
