  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThis response exceeds expectations by providing six biblical examples that illustrate the concept of mercy, including some lesser-known passages like David and Mephibosheth (2 Samuel 9) and God's Compassion in Psalms (Psalm 103:8-12). The writer's use of a variety of scriptural references helps to deepen understanding of mercy and its transformative power. Additionally, the real-life applications highlighted in each example help readers connect these biblical concepts to their everyday lives.\n\nTo reach a perfect score, this response could benefit from more explicit connections between the biblical examples and the concern about enhancing understanding of mercy through scriptural references and real-life applications."
