  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student has provided an excellent response that showcases a deep understanding of the power and importance of prayer as depicted in various biblical stories. They have selected diverse examples that effectively illustrate different aspects of prayer, such as personal supplication, divine intervention, perseverance in faith, seeking wisdom, surrender to God's will, and seeking blessings. The examples chosen are all relevant and well-explained, showing a good grasp of the topic. However, the answer could have been improved by including the reference answer's examples to provide a more comprehensive coverage of the topic. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong comprehension of the theme and effectively conveyed the significance of prayer in the Christian worldview."
