  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed response that not only listed examples of repentance from the Bible but also explained the significance of each instance in demonstrating repentance. The examples chosen effectively illustrate different aspects of repentance such as acknowledgment of sin, genuine remorse, and a desire to change. The student's answer aligns well with the concern of learning from biblical examples to understand the practical application of repentance in daily life. Great job in connecting the examples to the broader concept of repentance and its importance in Christian faith."
