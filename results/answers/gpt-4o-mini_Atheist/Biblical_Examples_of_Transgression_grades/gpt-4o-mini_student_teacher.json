  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful response by citing relevant Bible verses that illustrate the concept of transgression and its consequences. However, the student could have improved their answer by including references that directly align with the concern of learning from Biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life. By incorporating examples like 1 Thessalonians 4:6, Daniel 9:24-25, and Psalm 32:1, the student would have demonstrated a deeper understanding of applying biblical wisdom to personal growth and avoiding transgressions in one's own life."
