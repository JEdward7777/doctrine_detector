# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, the concept of transgression often refers to the act of violating a command or law, particularly in relation to God's rules. Here are several key references that illustrate this concept:

1. **Psalm 51:1-3**: In this Psalm, David acknowledges his transgressions before God. He writes, "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions." This illustrates the recognition of sin and moral failing.

2. **Exodus 34:7**: This verse discusses God's nature, specifically that He "will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation." Here, transgression is tied to the serious consequences of sin.

3. **Isaiah 53:5**: This passage speaks of the suffering servant and indicates that “he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities.” This highlights the concept that transgression has repercussions not just for the individual but for the community and the need for atonement.

4. **Romans 4:15**: The Apostle Paul writes, "For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression." This demonstrates the relationship between law and transgression, emphasizing that without law, the concept of transgression does not exist.

5. **1 John 3:4**: This verse provides a definition of sin, stating, “Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.” Here, transgression is aligned with the notion of lawbreaking, reinforcing the link between divine commandments and moral failure.

These references collectively illustrate that transgression in a biblical context is connected to disobedience to God’s commands, the acknowledgment of human fallibility, and the necessity for redemption and mercy.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of transgression in the Bible, using relevant references and connecting them to the idea of disobeying God's commands. The examples cited effectively demonstrate the consequences and need for atonement related to transgression. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern of learning from Biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life. It would be beneficial to include practical applications or reflections on how individuals can avoid transgressing against God's commands based on the cited passages.
