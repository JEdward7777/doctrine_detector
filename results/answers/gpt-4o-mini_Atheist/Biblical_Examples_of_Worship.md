## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Certainly! One clear example of worship being negatively contrasted with idol worship can be found in the book of Exodus, specifically in Exodus 20:3-5, which is part of the Ten Commandments. 

In this passage, God commands the Israelites to worship Him alone, stating, "You shall have no other gods before me" and "You shall not make for yourself a carved image." This serves to differentiate the worship of the one true God from the idolatry prevalent in surrounding cultures, where physical representations of deities were commonplace. 

Another instance can be seen in the story of the Golden Calf in Exodus 32. When the Israelites create and worship a golden calf, Moses confronts them, emphasizing the seriousness of idol worship in contrast to the worship of Yahweh. This narrative demonstrates not only the danger of turning away from true worship but also the consequences that follow such acts of idolatry.

These examples illustrate a strong biblical dichotomy between authentic worship of God and the act of idol worship, highlighting the emphasis placed on fidelity to God in the Judeo-Christian tradition.
