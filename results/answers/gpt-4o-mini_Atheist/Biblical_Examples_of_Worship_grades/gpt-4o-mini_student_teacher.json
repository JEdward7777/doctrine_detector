  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported response that incorporated multiple examples from the Bible to demonstrate the negative contrast between worship of God and idol worship. They effectively connected the examples to the concern of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the question posed."
