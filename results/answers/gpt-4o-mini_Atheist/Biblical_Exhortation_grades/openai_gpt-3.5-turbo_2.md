Jesus gave his apostles the directive to spread the good news, also known as the Gospel, to all nations. This instruction is often referred to as the Great Commission. In passages such as Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus commands his followers to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe all that he had taught. This directive emphasizes the importance of evangelism and the sharing of his teachings beyond the immediate community, reflecting a mission to reach all people with the message of love, redemption, and salvation.
