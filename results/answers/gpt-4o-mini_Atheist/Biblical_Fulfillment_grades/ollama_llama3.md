## [Answer](../Biblical_Fulfillment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The references to Jesus as the 'King of the Jews' in the New Testament can be understood as fulfilling various Old Testament prophecies that center around the themes of kingship, lineage, and the expectation of a Messiah.

1. **Royal Lineage of David**: The Old Testament extensively describes the expectation of a Messiah from the lineage of King David. For instance, in 2 Samuel 7:12-16, God promises David that his kingdom will be established forever through his descendants. The New Testament genealogies, particularly in Matthew 1:1-16 and Luke 3:23-38, trace Jesus' lineage back to David, establishing His rightful claim to the title of 'King'.

2. **Prophecies of a Coming King**: Various prophets spoke of a future king who would reign with justice and righteousness. For example, Isaiah 9:6-7 proclaims a child born to us who will be called "Mighty God," "Everlasting Father," and "Prince of Peace," and whose reign will be characterized by justice and righteousness. Similarly, Jeremiah 23:5-6 prophesies a "righteous Branch" from David who will execute justice and righteousness in the land.

3. **Zechariah and the Humble King**: Zechariah 9:9 describes a king coming to Jerusalem "righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey." This prophecy is often linked to Jesusâ€™ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which is celebrated on Palm Sunday in the New Testament (Matthew 21:5). This connection emphasizes Jesus' role as a king who brings peace rather than military might.

4. **The Charge Against Jesus**: In the New Testament, the title 'King of the Jews' also serves a critical function during the Passion narrative. When Jesus is crucified, the inscription above His cross reads "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" (John 19:19-22), which was intended by the Roman authorities as a form of mockery. However, this title reflects the messianic expectation prevalent at the time and indicates that the early Christians saw Jesus' death and resurrection as the ultimate realization of the kingly prophecies.

5. **The Fulfillment of the Messianic Role**: Throughout the New Testament, Jesus' life, teachings, and actions are portrayed as fulfilling both the expectations and prophecies of a Messiah. His role as King transcends traditional earthly kingship, as He is depicted as establishing a spiritual kingdom that emphasizes values such as love, mercy, and justice.

In summary, the references to Jesus as the 'King of the Jews' align with the Old Testament prophecies regarding the anticipated Messiah, drawing connections to Davidic lineage, the nature of His kingship, and the fulfillment of scriptural expectations in the context of first-century Judaism. This understanding allows for a deeper exploration of the continuity between the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament narrative.
