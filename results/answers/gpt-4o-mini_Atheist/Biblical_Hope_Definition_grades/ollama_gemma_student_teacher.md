## [Answer](../Biblical_Hope_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In a biblical context, the term "hope" signifies a confident expectation and trust in Godâ€™s promises and faithfulness. It is fundamentally tied to the belief in God's character and His willingness to fulfill what He has declared. 

Throughout the Scriptures, hope often reflects an assurance of future outcomes that are rooted in faith. For example, in the Old Testament, particularly in the Psalms, hope is frequently associated with waiting for God's intervention, deliverance, or salvation. The well-known verse in Jeremiah 29:11, "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future," encapsulates this understanding.

In the New Testament, hope takes on additional dimensions through the teachings about Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal life. Romans 15:13 states, "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit." This indicates that hope is not only a passive expectation but also an active state, fueled by faith and spiritual empowerment.

Overall, in the biblical narrative, hope serves as a vital anchor for believers, encouraging perseverance in the face of adversity and aligning their lives toward a greater, divinely ordained purpose.
