The verses selected accurately capture different aspects of God's majesty, showcasing His grandeur and dominion over all creation. However, the student missed the specific Bible references outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the student's answer is robust and aligned with the concern of connecting scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature, incorporating the specified Bible verses would have further enhanced the response."
