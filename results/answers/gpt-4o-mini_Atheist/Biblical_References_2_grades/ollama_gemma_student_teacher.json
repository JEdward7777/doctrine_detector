  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of God's majesty and provides well-chosen Bible verses to support their claims. They clearly articulate the various dimensions of God's majesty, including His power, sovereignty, holiness, and creativity. The student's ability to connect these verses with the understanding of God's majestic nature shows a deep theological insight. However, including the reference answer provided by the teacher would have elevated the grade to 90/100."
