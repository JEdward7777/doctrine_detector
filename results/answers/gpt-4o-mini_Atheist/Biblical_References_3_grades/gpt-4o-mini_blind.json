  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: The response provides a detailed and insightful exploration of how various Old Testament references contribute to understanding the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah. The student effectively connects key passages such as Daniel 7, Psalm 8, Ezekiel, Isaiah 53, and Genesis 1 to the messianic expectations surrounding the \"Son of Man\" motif. The inclusion of relevant scripture passages and their interpretations enriches the analysis. Additionally, the explanations demonstrate a good understanding of the doctrinal significance of these references within the broader context of Jewish and Christian thought. Well done!"
