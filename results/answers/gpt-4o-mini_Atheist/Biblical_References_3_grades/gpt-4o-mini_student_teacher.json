  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the Old Testament references contributing to the understanding of the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah. They effectively analyzed key passages and demonstrated a clear connection between the Old Testament and New Testament messianic expectations. However, the student could have focused more on the specific concerns outlined in exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus\u2019 messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' By linking the Old Testament passages directly to the New Testament interpretations of Jesus as the 'Son of Man,' the answer could have been more cohesive and directly relevant to the concern provided."
