  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive overview of the Old Testament references that contribute to the understanding of Jesus as the \"Son of Man\" in the New Testament. The writer has done an excellent job of highlighting key passages, such as Daniel 7:13-14, Psalm 8:4-6, Ezekiel, and Isaiah 53, which shed light on the messianic expectations surrounding this title.\n\nThe response also effectively explores how these Old Testament references inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' role as the \"Son of Man.\" The writer does an excellent job of tracing the development of the theme from its roots in Jewish thought to its culmination in Christian understanding.\n\nOne area for improvement is that the response could be even stronger if it explicitly connected the dots between these Old Testament references and the New Testament portrayal of Jesus. While the writer touches on this connection, a more explicit link would strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical texts and their relationship to each other. The writer has done an outstanding job of exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\""
