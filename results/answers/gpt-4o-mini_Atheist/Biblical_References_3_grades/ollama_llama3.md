## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The term "Son of Man" has significant roots in the Old Testament and contributes to the understanding of the coming Messiah in various ways. Here are some key references that help illuminate this connection:

1. **Daniel 7:13-14**: This is perhaps the most explicit reference linking "Son of Man" to a messianic figure. In this passage, Daniel describes a vision where one like a "son of man" approaches the Ancient of Days and is given authority, glory, and a kingdom that will never be destroyed. This image of a heavenly figure who receives dominion is foundational for later interpretations of the Messiah.

2. **Psalm 8:4-6**: In this psalm, the phrase "son of man" is used to reflect on humanity's place in creation. The verse speaks to the dignity and authority granted to humans, which some later Jewish interpretations connected to the coming of a messianic figure who would restore humanity's intended status and order.

3. **Ezekiel**: The prophet Ezekiel frequently refers to himself as "son of man" (e.g., Ezekiel 2:1). While this usage primarily denotes human mortality and weakness, it also establishes a theme of God’s messenger or representative being human, a concept that would resonate with the later understanding of a messianic figure who would embody both divine authority and human experience.

4. **Isaiah 53**: Though the term "Son of Man" does not explicitly appear here, the descriptor of the "suffering servant" in Isaiah 53 has been interpreted as prophetic of the Messiah. The portrayal of one who suffers for the sins of others complements the character of Jesus, who is often identified as the "Son of Man" in the New Testament.

5. **Genesis 1:26-27**: The creation of humanity "in our image, after our likeness" establishes the intrinsic value and purpose of humankind. This theological foundation sets a stage where the messianic figure, often understood in light of the "Son of Man," upholds and redeems this intended relationship between God and humanity.

These texts collectively contribute to the development of the "Son of Man" motif in Jewish thought, particularly as it relates to messianic expectations, highlighting themes of authority, representation, suffering, and humanity. Each of these elements plays a role in shaping the understanding of the future Messiah in both Jewish and Christian traditions.

I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response provides a comprehensive overview of the Old Testament references that contribute to the understanding of Jesus as the "Son of Man" in the New Testament. The writer has done an excellent job of highlighting key passages, such as Daniel 7:13-14, Psalm 8:4-6, Ezekiel, and Isaiah 53, which shed light on the messianic expectations surrounding this title.

The response also effectively explores how these Old Testament references inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' role as the "Son of Man." The writer does an excellent job of tracing the development of the theme from its roots in Jewish thought to its culmination in Christian understanding.

One area for improvement is that the response could be even stronger if it explicitly connected the dots between these Old Testament references and the New Testament portrayal of Jesus. While the writer touches on this connection, a more explicit link would strengthen the argument.

Overall, however, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical texts and their relationship to each other. The writer has done an outstanding job of exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man."
