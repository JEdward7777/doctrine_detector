The student effectively incorporates key references from the Old Testament, such as Daniel 7:13-14, Psalm 8:4-6, Ezekiel, Isaiah 53, and Genesis 1:26-27, to demonstrate the development of the 'Son of Man' motif in Jewish thought and its connection to messianic expectations. The analysis is well-supported and demonstrates a strong understanding of how these Old Testament passages contribute to the understanding of Jesus as the fulfillment of the messianic role of the 'Son of Man' in the New Testament."
