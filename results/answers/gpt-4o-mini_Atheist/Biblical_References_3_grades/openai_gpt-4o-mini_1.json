The inclusion of key references and their significance in shaping the understanding of Jesus' messianic role is thorough and well-supported. Additionally, the response effectively connects the Old Testament context to the New Testament interpretation of Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophetic motifs. Great job in addressing the concern with depth and clarity."
