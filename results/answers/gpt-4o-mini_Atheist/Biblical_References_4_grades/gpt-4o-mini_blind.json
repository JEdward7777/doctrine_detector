The student effectively explains the theological implications of each passage and demonstrates a solid understanding of how the term \"Lord\" conveys God's sovereignty, care, and authority. The integration of both Old and New Testament verses showcases a comprehensive view of the term's significance throughout the biblical narrative. Great job!"
