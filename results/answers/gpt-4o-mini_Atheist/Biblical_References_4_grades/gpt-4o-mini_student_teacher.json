  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided an excellent response showcasing various biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God, along with insightful explanations of the significance of each reference. The examples chosen effectively convey the themes of God's authority, sovereignty, and divinity, aligning well with the concern of reinforcing understanding of God's authority as Lord. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include one or more of the references provided in the teacher's answer for a more comprehensive coverage of biblical passages. Overall, a well-researched and well-explained response."
