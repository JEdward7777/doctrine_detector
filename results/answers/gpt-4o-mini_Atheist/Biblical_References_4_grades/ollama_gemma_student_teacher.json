  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that effectively demonstrates an understanding of the significance of the term \"Lord\" in the Bible from a Christian perspective. The student provides clear examples from various passages to illustrate the different ways the term is used to convey concepts of God's sovereignty, care, and authority. The inclusion of relevant theological concepts such as God's eternal existence and role as Creator adds depth to the analysis."
