  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of biblical references that illustrate the usage of \"Lord\" in referring to God, but it lacks depth and breadth compared to the original answer. The original answer provided specific examples from Exodus, Psalm, Isaiah, Matthew, and Romans, whereas the given response only mentions Psalms, Matthew, and Philippians. Additionally, the concern about reinforcing the understanding of God's authority is partially addressed in the response, but it could be more explicitly linked to the biblical references provided.\n\nThe original answer demonstrates a stronger grasp of biblical context and theological implications, earning it a higher grade. However, the given response shows some effort in providing relevant examples, which earns it a decent score."
