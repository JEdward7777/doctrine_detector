It effectively reinforces the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty and lordship in the Christian faith. The response could have been strengthened by including a more explicit connection to the concern raised about reinforcing the understanding of God's authority, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview."
