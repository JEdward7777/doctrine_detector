The reference to Matthew 26 and 1 Corinthians 5 to support the connection between unleavened bread, Passover tradition, and the new covenant is well articulated. The student effectively showcases how the symbolism of unleavened bread is tied to purity and sincerity in the Christian faith. However, to enhance the response, it could have delved deeper into the theological significance of unleavened bread specifically in relation to Christ's sacrifice and the atonement."
