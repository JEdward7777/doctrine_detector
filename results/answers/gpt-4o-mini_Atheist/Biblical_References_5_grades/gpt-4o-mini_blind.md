## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of unleavened bread in the New Testament is notably connected to the Last Supper, where Jesus instituted the practice of Communion (or the Eucharist). One significant scripture that refers to unleavened bread is found in the Gospel of Matthew, specifically Matthew 26:17-29. In this passage, Jesus shares bread with his disciples, symbolizing his body, which links the idea of unleavened bread from the Passover tradition to the new covenant established through his sacrifice.

Additionally, in 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, Paul discusses the need for the Christian community to be like unleavened bread, emphasizing purity and sincerity as he calls for the removal of old leaven, symbolizing sin, to celebrate the Passover in a new way through Christ. This connection highlights the transformation of the Passover and the significance of unleavened bread in both a historical and a spiritual context within Christian teachings.

Comment: 
The response provides a solid explanation of how the concept of unleavened bread is connected to Christian teachings, particularly through the Last Supper and the institution of Communion. The reference to Matthew 26 and 1 Corinthians 5 to support the connection between unleavened bread, Passover tradition, and the new covenant is well articulated. The student effectively showcases how the symbolism of unleavened bread is tied to purity and sincerity in the Christian faith. However, to enhance the response, it could have delved deeper into the theological significance of unleavened bread specifically in relation to Christ's sacrifice and the atonement.
