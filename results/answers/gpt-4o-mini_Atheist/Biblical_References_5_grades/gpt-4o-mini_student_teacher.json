  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer by incorporating both Matthew 26:17-29 and 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 to connect the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings. They effectively highlighted how these scriptures relate to the Last Supper and the call for purity in the Christian community. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical texts and their significance in Christian practices. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, as it was specifically mentioned in the teacher's reference answer."
