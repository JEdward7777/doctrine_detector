## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of unleavened bread in the New Testament is notably connected to the Last Supper, where Jesus instituted the practice of Communion (or the Eucharist). One significant scripture that refers to unleavened bread is found in the Gospel of Matthew, specifically Matthew 26:17-29. In this passage, Jesus shares bread with his disciples, symbolizing his body, which links the idea of unleavened bread from the Passover tradition to the new covenant established through his sacrifice.

Additionally, in 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, Paul discusses the need for the Christian community to be like unleavened bread, emphasizing purity and sincerity as he calls for the removal of old leaven, symbolizing sin, to celebrate the Passover in a new way through Christ. This connection highlights the transformation of the Passover and the significance of unleavened bread in both a historical and a spiritual context within Christian teachings.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive answer by incorporating both Matthew 26:17-29 and 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 to connect the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings. They effectively highlighted how these scriptures relate to the Last Supper and the call for purity in the Christian community. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical texts and their significance in Christian practices. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, as it was specifically mentioned in the teacher's reference answer.
