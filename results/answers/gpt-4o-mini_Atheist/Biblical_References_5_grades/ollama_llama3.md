## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of unleavened bread in the New Testament is notably connected to the Last Supper, where Jesus instituted the practice of Communion (or the Eucharist). One significant scripture that refers to unleavened bread is found in the Gospel of Matthew, specifically Matthew 26:17-29. In this passage, Jesus shares bread with his disciples, symbolizing his body, which links the idea of unleavened bread from the Passover tradition to the new covenant established through his sacrifice.

Additionally, in 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, Paul discusses the need for the Christian community to be like unleavened bread, emphasizing purity and sincerity as he calls for the removal of old leaven, symbolizing sin, to celebrate the Passover in a new way through Christ. This connection highlights the transformation of the Passover and the significance of unleavened bread in both a historical and a spiritual context within Christian teachings.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 85.

The response does a good job of identifying relevant biblical texts that provide insight into Christian practices, specifically mentioning Matthew 26:17-29 and 1 Corinthians 5:6-8. These texts are indeed important for understanding Christian practices like Communion and the significance of unleavened bread in the context of salvation.

However, I deduct a few points because the response could have gone further in exploring the biblical connections and themes. For example, while it's mentioned that Jesus shares bread with his disciples symbolizing his body, it would be even more insightful to delve deeper into what this act represents in terms of Christ's sacrifice and redemption. Similarly, Paul's call for the Christian community to be like unleavened bread could have been explored further in terms of its implications for Christian living.

Overall, while the response provides some good biblical connections, it could have dug deeper to provide more nuance and insight into these themes.
