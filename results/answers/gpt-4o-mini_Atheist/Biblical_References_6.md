## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of resurrection is significant in the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, where it relates to the resurrection of Jesus and the hope of eternal life for believers. Here are some key verses that provide insight into this concept:

1. **John 11:25-26**: Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?"

2. **1 Corinthians 15:20-22**: "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."

3. **Romans 6:4**: "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

4. **Philippians 3:20-21**: "But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body."

5. **Revelation 20:12-13**: "And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done."

These verses collectively reflect the theological significance of resurrection as a promise of new life, transformation, and eternal existence beyond physical death. They are central to the Christian faith and have shaped various beliefs and practices regarding life after death.
