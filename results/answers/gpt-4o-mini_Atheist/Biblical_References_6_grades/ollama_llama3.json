  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThe main strength of this response is its ability to focus on scripture as key authoritative texts, which aligns perfectly with the concern provided. The writer provides specific Bible verses that discuss resurrection and eternal life, demonstrating a clear understanding of the importance of Scripture in Christian theology. Additionally, the writer's inclusion of various passages from different books of the Bible shows a good breadth of biblical knowledge.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more concise and focused on the main point. The writer provides five verses, which are all relevant to the topic, but some of them may not directly address the concept of resurrection. A slightly more targeted approach to selecting specific verses would strengthen the response even further.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of Scripture in Christian theology and provides relevant biblical examples to support its claims."
