  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively uses key Bible verses to discuss the concept of resurrection and its significance in the Christian faith. The additional verses provided in the given answer are relevant and contribute to the discussion. However, there could have been more integration of these verses into the response to further strengthen the argument. Overall, the response aligns well with the concern of focusing on scripture for grounding beliefs in Christianity."
