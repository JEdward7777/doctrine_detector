  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the concept of resurrection in the Bible, supported by key verses that are central to Christian beliefs regarding resurrection and eternal life. By referencing specific verses and discussing their theological significance, the response effectively grounds the discussion in authoritative Christian texts, aligning well with the concern provided. The response could have been improved by directly addressing all the verses mentioned in the original answer, but overall, it effectively integrates scriptural references to support the discussion on resurrection within a Christian worldview."
