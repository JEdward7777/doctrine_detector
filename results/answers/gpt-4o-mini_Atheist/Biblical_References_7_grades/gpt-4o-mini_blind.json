The scriptures referenced are appropriate and accurately convey the importance of rest, worship, and spiritual reflection associated with the Sabbath. Additionally, the inclusion of both Old Testament and New Testament references demonstrates an understanding of the continuity of the Sabbath's significance throughout the Bible. Great job!"
