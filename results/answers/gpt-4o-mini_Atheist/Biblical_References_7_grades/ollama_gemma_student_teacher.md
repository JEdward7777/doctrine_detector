## [Answer](../Biblical_References_7.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Certainly! The Sabbath is an important concept in the Bible, particularly within the Jewish tradition. Here are a few key references that highlight its significance:

1. **Genesis 2:2-3** - In this passage, God rests on the seventh day after creation, blessing and sanctifying it, setting a precedent for the Sabbath as a day of rest.

2. **Exodus 20:8-11** - This is part of the Ten Commandments, where God commands the Israelites to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy, emphasizing the importance of rest and reflection.

3. **Deuteronomy 5:12-15** - This passage reiterates the command to observe the Sabbath, adding a reminder of the Israelites' liberation from slavery in Egypt, thus linking the Sabbath to themes of freedom and social justice.

4. **Isaiah 58:13-14** - Here, the prophet Isaiah encourages the people to honor the Sabbath by refraining from their own pursuits, suggesting that it is a time for spiritual enrichment and connection with God.

5. **Mark 2:27-28** - In the New Testament, Jesus responds to questions about the Sabbath by stating that "the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath," highlighting its purpose as a benefit for humanity rather than a strict burden.

These references illustrate the Sabbath's role as a day of rest, worship, and community, reflecting both physical and spiritual significance across different contexts in the Bible.
