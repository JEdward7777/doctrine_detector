They effectively highlighted key Bible verses and their contributions to the understanding of redemption, emphasizing themes of sacrifice, mediation, and divine love. However, the student could have incorporated the reference answer's verses, such as Isaiah 43:3, to provide a more comprehensive exploration of the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption."
