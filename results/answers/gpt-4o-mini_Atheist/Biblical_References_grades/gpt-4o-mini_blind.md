3. **Psalm 89:33-34**: "But I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness. I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips."

4. **Isaiah 54:10**: "Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed," says the Lord, who has compassion on you.

5. **Lamentations 3:22-23**: "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness."

6. **1 Corinthians 1:9**: "God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."

7. **Hebrews 10:23**: "Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful."
