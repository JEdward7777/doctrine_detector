  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained list of Bible verses related to covenant faithfulness, showcasing a strong understanding of the concept. However, the student missed incorporating the teacher's specific references of Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18, which would have enhanced the relevance and comprehensiveness of the answer. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic, but lacked direct alignment with the specified concern provided by the teacher."
