While Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18 are indeed important passages, they do not fully convey the idea of God's unchanging and reliable nature as seen in the additional verses provided (Deuteronomy 7:9, Psalm 25:10, Psalm 89:33-34, Isaiah 54:10, Lamentations 3:22-23, 1 Corinthians 1:9, Hebrews 10:23). The provided examples would have been strengthened if they were connected to the understanding of covenant faithfulness, demonstrating how these specific passages illustrate and build upon this theme."
