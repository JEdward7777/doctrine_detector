Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 provide important insights into the early Christian understanding of Gentile inclusion in the faith.

In Acts 9:13-16, we see the account of Saul (who later becomes Paul) receiving a vision from God. Ananias, a disciple, is initially hesitant to minister to Saul, knowing his previous persecution of Christians. However, God instructs Ananias to go, saying that Saul is chosen to be an instrument to the Gentiles, as well as to kings and the people of Israel. This passage emphasizes that Saul's mission—and by extension, the mission of the early church—was not limited to Jews but was intended to extend to Gentiles as well. This indicates an early acknowledgment of the universality of the Christian message.

In Galatians 2:16, Paul discusses the issue of justification and the role of faith in Jesus Christ, particularly in relation to both Jews and Gentiles. He argues that a person is justified not by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. This assertion is critical as it directly challenges the idea that adherence to Jewish law is necessary for salvation, thereby affirming that Gentiles can be fully included in the Christian community without having to follow Jewish customs or laws.

Together, these passages reveal that the early Christian movement recognized the inclusion of Gentiles as essential to its growth and mission. They illustrate a pivotal shift from a primarily Jewish faith to a broader, more inclusive religion that welcomed believers from all backgrounds, emphasizing faith in Christ as the key to salvation rather than adherence to the law. This inclusion was a foundational aspect of Paul's theology and significantly shaped the development of early Christian identity.
