The writer effectively explores how these passages demonstrate the universality of the Christian message, emphasizing faith in Jesus Christ as the key to salvation rather than adherence to Jewish law.\n\nThe response closely aligns with the given answer and addresses the concern about scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion. The only area for improvement is that the writer could have more explicitly connected their analysis to the broader theme of God's sovereignty and grace, which underlies the concept of Gentile inclusion in the early Christian movement.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical passages and effectively applies them to the concern about scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion."
