  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the Festival of Weeks, highlighting key references from Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts. They effectively linked the festival's significance both agriculturally and spiritually. The only deduction is for missing the mention of 2 Chronicles in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost from a Christian worldview."
