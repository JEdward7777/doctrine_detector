# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot or Pentecost, is mentioned in several books of the Bible, primarily in the context of its agricultural significance and its role as a pilgrimage festival. Here are the key references:

1. **Exodus**: 
   - **Exodus 23:16**: The festival is referred to as the "Feast of Weeks," where it is instructed that the people should bring the first fruits of their harvest to the Lord.
   - **Exodus 34:22**: Similar instructions regarding the festival and its observance are reiterated.

2. **Leviticus**: 
   - **Leviticus 23:15-22**: This passage provides detailed instructions for the observance of the Festival of Weeks, including the counting of seven weeks from Passover and the offerings to be made.

3. **Deuteronomy**: 
   - **Deuteronomy 16:9-12**: This text describes the counting of weeks and emphasizes the celebration as a joyous occasion, instructing Israelites to rejoice and remember their history and deliverance.

4. **Numbers**: 
   - **Numbers 28:26-31**: It specifies the offerings and sacrifices to be made during the Festival of Weeks.

5. **Acts of the Apostles**: 
   - **Acts 2:1**: In the New Testament, this passage refers to the day of Pentecost (the Greek equivalent of Shavuot), which is significant for Christians because of the Holy Spirit's descent on the apostles.

These references illustrate the festival's dual significance as both an agricultural harvest celebration and a time for spiritual reflection and community celebration among the people of Israel.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a detailed overview of the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot/Pentecost) with specific references from Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts of the Apostles, showcasing a good understanding of its scriptural basis. However, the discrepancy in referencing "2 Chronicles" instead of the correct books diminishes the accuracy of the response, hence the grade of 70. It is important to accurately cite biblical references in discussions related to Christian beliefs to ensure the correct interpretation and understanding of the significance of Pentecost.
