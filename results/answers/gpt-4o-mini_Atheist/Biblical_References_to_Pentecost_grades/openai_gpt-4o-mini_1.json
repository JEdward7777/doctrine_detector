The explanation correctly highlights the festival's agricultural and spiritual significance within the biblical context. However, the initial answer inaccurately stated that references to the Festival of Weeks can be found in 2 Chronicles instead of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. A minor deduction in points is warranted for this error."
