  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a thoughtful analysis of the passages from 1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20 in exploring the nature of Christ as Savior within their respective contexts. The explanation highlights the universality of God's saving grace through Christ, the importance of faith in relation to salvation, and the consequences of turning away from Christ after knowing Him. The response appropriately connects these passages to broader themes of grace, responsibility, and the transformative power of knowing Christ. Well done overall, with solid doctrinal understanding and thorough analysis."
