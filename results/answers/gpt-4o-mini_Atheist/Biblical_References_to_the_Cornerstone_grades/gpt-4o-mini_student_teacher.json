  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 70.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive overview of various Bible verses that reference Jesus as the cornerstone and has effectively explained the significance of each passage in conveying His role. The student also links these verses to the concepts of faith, salvation, unity, and prophecy, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic.\n\nHowever, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the key verses mentioned in the teacher's reference answer and delving deeper into the specific implications of Jesus being the cornerstone in relation to faith and the Church. Encouraging deeper exploration and reflection on these central verses would strengthen the overall response and align it more closely with the concern provided.\n\nOverall, the student has showcased a good understanding of the topic but could benefit from a more targeted and in-depth analysis of the essential verses."
