  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nThis response receives high marks for its thoroughness, accuracy, and biblical support. The writer provides multiple verses from both the Old and New Testaments that demonstrate Jesus' significance as the cornerstone of faith and the Church. The discussion is well-organized, and the connections between the different passages are clear.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from a more explicit explanation of how exploring scripture deepens believers' understanding of Jesus' significance. While the writer mentions this concern in the prompt, they do not explicitly address it in their response. However, the biblical evidence provided does implicitly support this idea, as it shows how scripture testifies to Jesus' importance and role in faith.\n\nOverall, the response is strong, and with a slight emphasis on the concern, it could be even more effective at encouraging believers to explore scripture and deepen their understanding of Jesus' significance."
