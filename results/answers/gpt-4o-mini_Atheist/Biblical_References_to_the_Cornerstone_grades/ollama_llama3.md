## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Cornerstone.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of Jesus as the cornerstone is referenced in several key biblical passages, primarily from the New Testament, but with roots in the Old Testament as well. Here are some notable verses:

1. **Psalm 118:22-23** (Old Testament):
   - "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes."
   - This verse highlights the idea of a rejected stone becoming essential, symbolizing how Jesus, despite being rejected by many, is foundational to faith and salvation.

2. **Matthew 21:42** (New Testament):
   - "Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures: "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes"?'"
   - Here, Jesus directly applies the Old Testament verse to Himself, reinforcing His identity and significance within the context of the religious leaders' rejection.

3. **Acts 4:11** (New Testament):
   - "Jesus is 'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.'"
   - This passage, spoken by Peter, emphasizes the centrality of Jesus in the foundation of the Christian faith, underlining both His rejection and His pivotal role.

4. **Ephesians 2:19-20** (New Testament):
   - "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with Godâ€™s people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."
   - In this metaphoric representation, Jesus is presented as the chief cornerstone of the Church, signifying His authority and the unity of believers within the faith community.

5. **1 Peter 2:6-7** (New Testament):
   - "For in Scripture it says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.' Now to you who believe, this stone is precious."
   - This passage speaks to Jesus as a worthy foundation for faith, emphasizing both His value to believers and the concept of trust in Him as a source of honor and salvation.

These verses collectively convey that Jesus serves as a vital cornerstone in the structure of faith, representing stability, foundational truth, and the fulfillment of prophecy. He is seen as essential for salvation, unifying believers into one community and shaping the identity of the Church.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 95

This response receives high marks for its thoroughness, accuracy, and biblical support. The writer provides multiple verses from both the Old and New Testaments that demonstrate Jesus' significance as the cornerstone of faith and the Church. The discussion is well-organized, and the connections between the different passages are clear.

The only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from a more explicit explanation of how exploring scripture deepens believers' understanding of Jesus' significance. While the writer mentions this concern in the prompt, they do not explicitly address it in their response. However, the biblical evidence provided does implicitly support this idea, as it shows how scripture testifies to Jesus' importance and role in faith.

Overall, the response is strong, and with a slight emphasis on the concern, it could be even more effective at encouraging believers to explore scripture and deepen their understanding of Jesus' significance.
