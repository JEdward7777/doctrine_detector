  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-thought-out response, citing relevant Bible verses and offering insights into God's character as the 'Most High.' However, the student missed referencing Psalm 83:18 and Daniel 4:17, which are specific verses given in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to carefully follow the given guidance can help in fully exploring the significance of God's sovereignty as portrayed in the Bible from a Christian perspective."
