2. **Psalm  Most 11:7** - "For the LORD is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face."
   - Here, God's righteousness is again highlighted. Being the 'Most High' denotes His position as the ultimate moral authority.

5. **Genesis 14:18-20** - In this narrative, Melchizedek is called "priest of God Most High" and blesses Abram, asserting that God is the Creator and possessor of heaven and earth. This reinforces His sovereign control over all creation.

6. **Daniel 4:34-35** - "At the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation."
   - This passage highlights God's eternal nature and dominion, revealing that His authority is not confined by time or space.

These verses collectively illustrate that God as the 'Most High' reflects His unmatched sovereignty, righteousness, authority, and eternal nature, reinforcing the understanding that He is central to the universe's moral and spiritual order.
