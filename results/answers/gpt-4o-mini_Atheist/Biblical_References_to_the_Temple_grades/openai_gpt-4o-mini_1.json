  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and relevant list of key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh,\" supporting the idea with appropriate verses from the Hebrew Bible. The inclusion of additional references like 1 Samuel 1:9, Isaiah 2:2, and Jeremiah 7:14 enriches the understanding of this concept in relation to God's dwelling place. The response effectively demonstrates knowledge and engagement with the topic through scriptural references. Great job!"
