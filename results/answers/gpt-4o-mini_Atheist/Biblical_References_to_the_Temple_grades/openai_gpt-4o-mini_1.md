In the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), several scriptures refer to the temple as the "house of Yahweh." Some key references include:

1. **1 Samuel 1:9** - Hannah prays in the temple of Yahweh, highlighting its significance as a sacred space.
2. **1 Kings 6:1** - This verse details Solomon beginning the construction of the temple, often referred to in context as the house of Yahweh.
3. **2 Chronicles 2:4** - Solomon refers to the temple as a house for the name of Yahweh when preparing to build it.
4. **Isaiah 2:2** - This verse mentions the house of Yahweh in the context of prophetic visions about the future.
5. **Jeremiah 7:14** - Yahweh refers to the temple as His house, emphasizing the relationship between the people and the temple.

These verses underscore the temple's centrality in the religious life of ancient Israel and its designation as the dwelling place of Yahweh among His people. The term "house of Yahweh" emphasizes both the physical space and the spiritual significance attributed to it by the community.
