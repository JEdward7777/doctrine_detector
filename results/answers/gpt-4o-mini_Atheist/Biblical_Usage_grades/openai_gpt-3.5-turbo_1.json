It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how genealogies, such as those in Genesis and Matthew, play a crucial role in tracing Jesus' lineage and fulfilling prophecies. The mention of divine promises and covenants further reinforces the theological importance of genealogies in Christian belief. A well-reasoned and insightful response overall."
