The student effectively references key passages from both the Old and New Testaments to illustrate the different contexts in which \"woe\" is used, highlighting themes of divine displeasure, warning, and accountability. The connections drawn between the term \"woe\" and various aspects of God's judgment are well articulated and supported with scriptural evidence. The response displays a strong understanding of the biblical concept of judgment and effectively communicates the gravity of divine judgment in relation to human behavior. Great job!"
