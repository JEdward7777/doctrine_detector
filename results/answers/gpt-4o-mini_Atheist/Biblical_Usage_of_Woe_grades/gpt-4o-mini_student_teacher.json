  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"woe\" in the Bible, offering relevant examples and insights into God's judgment based on those instances. The student effectively connects the use of \"woe\" to divine displeasure and impending judgment, highlighting various facets of judgment such as ethical conduct, social justice, reversal of fortunes, and consequences of sin. The student's analysis is thorough and demonstrates a good understanding of the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to include the specific verses mentioned in the reference answer (Ezekiel 13:17-18, Habakkuk 2:12, and Matthew 23:23) to further solidify the evaluation of the severity of God's judgment in the context of the term \"woe\".\n\nOverall, the student has shown a strong grasp of the topic and effectively integrated a Christian worldview into their analysis."
