The answer is thorough, well-structured, and supported with relevant biblical references. The inclusion of eschatological significance and spiritual metaphor is commendable, highlighting the broader theological implications of the term. Some aspects could have been further expanded upon for additional theological depth, but overall, this is a strong and doctrinally sound response."
