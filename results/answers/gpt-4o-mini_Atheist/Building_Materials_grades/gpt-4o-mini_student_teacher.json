  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough answer detailing various materials commonly used to construct altars in biblical times, along with references to relevant biblical passages. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of these materials in the context of worship and sacrificial rituals. However, the student could have improved their response by explicitly mentioning altars made from packed dirt or stones overlaid with metals, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, the student has shown a deep understanding of the materials used for altars during biblical times, aligning well with the Christian worldview concern provided."
