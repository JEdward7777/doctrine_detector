It effectively addresses the concern by enhancing understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship through the exploration of altar materials. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the altar materials to how they can deepen a Christian's understanding of worship practices in the context of biblical teachings."
