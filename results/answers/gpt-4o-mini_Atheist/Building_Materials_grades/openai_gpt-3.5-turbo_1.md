## [Answer](../Building_Materials.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In biblical times, altars were constructed using various materials depending on the cultural and historical context. Here are some common materials:

1. **Stone**: Natural stone was often used, particularly unhewn or uncut stones, as seen in Exodus 20:25, where God commands that altars be built of natural stones to avoid the use of tools, which could symbolize human effort overriding divine creation.

2. **Earth**: In some instances, altars were made of earth or dirt, as mentioned in Exodus 20:24. This aligns with the significance of the earth as a foundational element in many ancient rituals.

3. **Wood**: Wood was used for altars as well, particularly among cultures where portable structures were necessary or in specific types of offerings, such as the burnt offerings described in Leviticus.

4. **Bronze and other metals**: In later periods, particularly in the more elaborate constructions of the Temple, materials such as bronze, gold, and silver were also utilized, especially for sacrificial implements and decorative elements related to the altars.

These materials reflected the cultural practices and religious significance of the time, emphasizing the reverence and intention behind sacrificial rituals and worship.
