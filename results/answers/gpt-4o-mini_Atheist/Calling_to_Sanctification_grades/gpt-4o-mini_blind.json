However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the core Christian belief that sanctification is not merely a command to pursue holiness, but also a work of God's grace in the believer's life through the Holy Spirit. Emphasizing the importance of surrendering to God's transformative power would align more closely with a Christian worldview on sanctification. Additionally, incorporating more specific references to Christian practices such as repentance, faith, and dependence on Christ for sanctification would further strengthen the response."
