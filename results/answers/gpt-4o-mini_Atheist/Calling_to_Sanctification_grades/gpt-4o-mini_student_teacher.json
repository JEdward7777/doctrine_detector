  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation on the concept of personal sanctification in religious traditions, particularly in Christianity. They referenced relevant biblical passages and highlighted various practices that believers engage in to pursue holiness. However, the student's answer lacked a direct and clear response to the specific command given to believers regarding their personal sanctification as compared to the reference answer. The student could have emphasized more on the personal responsibility aspect in sanctification according to the Christian worldview."
