## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In many religious traditions, personal sanctification is an important aspect of the believer's life. For example, in Christianity, believers are often directed to pursue holiness and set themselves apart for God. Key biblical passages that address this command include 1 Thessalonians 4:3, where it states, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification," and Hebrews 12:14, which encourages followers to "Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."

Additionally, practices such as prayer, studying scripture, engaging in community, and participating in rituals or sacraments are typically emphasized as ways to grow in sanctification. While the specifics may vary across different faiths, the overarching theme is a commitment to personal growth and moral integrity in alignment with one's beliefs.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thorough explanation on the concept of personal sanctification in religious traditions, particularly in Christianity. They referenced relevant biblical passages and highlighted various practices that believers engage in to pursue holiness. However, the student's answer lacked a direct and clear response to the specific command given to believers regarding their personal sanctification as compared to the reference answer. The student could have emphasized more on the personal responsibility aspect in sanctification according to the Christian worldview.
