  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the command regarding personal sanctification in Christianity. They effectively referenced relevant biblical passages and explained the importance of various practices in the process of spiritual growth. However, the response could benefit from a more direct connection to the concern about personal responsibility, emphasizing the individual's role in their own sanctification rather than presenting it as a general commitment across faiths."
