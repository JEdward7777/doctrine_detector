## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In many religious traditions, personal sanctification is an important aspect of the believer's life. For example, in Christianity, believers are often directed to pursue holiness and set themselves apart for God. Key biblical passages that address this command include 1 Thessalonians 4:3, where it states, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification," and Hebrews 12:14, which encourages followers to "Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."

Additionally, practices such as prayer, studying scripture, engaging in community, and participating in rituals or sacraments are typically emphasized as ways to grow in sanctification. While the specifics may vary across different faiths, the overarching theme is a commitment to personal growth and moral integrity in alignment with one's beliefs.
