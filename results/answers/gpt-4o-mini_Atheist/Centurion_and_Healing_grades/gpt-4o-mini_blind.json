  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus, highlighting important themes of faith and authority. The student effectively discusses the centurion's understanding of authority, his faith transcending cultural boundaries, his recognition of Jesus' power, and the cultural dynamics at play. The integration of scriptural references and theological insights is commendable. However, to enhance the grade, the student could further strengthen the doctrinal connection by explicitly tying the themes discussed to Christian teachings on faith and authority, such as citing relevant Bible verses or theological interpretations supporting the points made. Overall, a solid analysis with room for deeper theological reflection."
