The response effectively considered both cultural and theological perspectives, demonstrating a deep understanding of the context. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct focus on the core aspect of faith in divine power, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a commendable effort in integrating various aspects of faith and authority in the biblical narrative."
