  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured response that effectively explains the significance of the centurion's visit from Peter in expanding the Gospel beyond the Jewish community. The answer addresses the concerns raised regarding the inclusivity of the Gospel and the mission of the Church to reach all nations. The student's analysis of the cultural and theological implications of this event, along with referencing key passages from Acts 10, demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Well done!"
