The suggestions are well-rounded and consider both personal and communal aspects of spiritual discipline. However, it could be strengthened by emphasizing the foundational importance of repentance and faith in Christ for spiritual purity rather than solely focusing on external practices. Additionally, connecting each proposed practice more explicitly to specific Old Testament principles or examples would enhance the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper doctrinal connections."
