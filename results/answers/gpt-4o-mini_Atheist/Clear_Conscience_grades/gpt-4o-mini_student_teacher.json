  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of what it means to have a clear conscience in the context of Christian teachings. They correctly emphasize the importance of inner peace, moral clarity, righteousness, confession, repentance, and seeking forgiveness. However, the student's response lacks a direct connection to the key concern that maintaining a clear conscience is vital for spiritual health and alignment with God's will. The reference answer emphasizes the aspect of not hiding any sin and being in obedience to God, which the student's answer does not explicitly address. In order to receive a higher grade, the student should have linked their response more explicitly to the concern provided."
