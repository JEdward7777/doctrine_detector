  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the comparison between humans and sheep in biblical teaching, highlighting key themes such as vulnerability, dependence, leadership, community, moral teachings, and judgment. The answer effectively connects these themes to scriptural references and conveys the significance of this comparison in conveying profound lessons relevant to both ancient and contemporary contexts. Well done overall, but could strengthen the integration of specific scriptures to reinforce doctrinal connections."
