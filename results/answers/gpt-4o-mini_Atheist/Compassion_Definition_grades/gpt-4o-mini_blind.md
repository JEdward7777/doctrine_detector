## [Answer](../Compassion_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible defines compassion as a deep awareness of and sympathy for another's suffering, coupled with a desire to alleviate that suffering. The concept is rooted in both the Old and New Testaments, where various passages emphasize the importance of showing kindness and mercy.

In the Old Testament, compassion is frequently linked to God's character. For instance, in Exodus 34:6-7, God describes Himself as "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." This reveals that compassion is an essential attribute of the divine, and believers are encouraged to emulate this quality in their own lives.

The New Testament further illustrates compassion through the teachings and actions of Jesus. In Matthew 9:36, for example, it states that when Jesus saw the crowds, He had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. This illustrates that true compassion involves recognizing the struggles of others and responding with empathy and action.

Actions associated with being compassionate in the biblical context include:

1. **Helping the Needy**: Providing for the poor, the orphaned, and the marginalized, as seen in passages like Deuteronomy 15:7-8, which encourages generosity to the needy.

2. **Forgiving Others**: Compassion often requires a willingness to forgive, as highlighted in passages like Colossians 3:12-13, which instructs believers to clothe themselves in compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.

3. **Serving Others**: Acts of service are key expressions of compassion. In John 13:14-15, Jesus washed His disciples' feet as a model of humility and service, encouraging them to do the same for others.

4. **Listening and Caring**: Proverbs speaks to the importance of being present and attentive to others' troubles. James 1:19 encourages believers to be quick to listen, which is essential in demonstrating compassion.

5. **Healing and Comforting**: Many accounts of Jesus involve healing the sick and comforting the distressed, as seen in Matthew 14:14, where He healed the sick out of compassion.

In summary, the biblical definition of compassion encompasses a heartfelt response to suffering that motivates actions aimed at helping, forgiving, and serving others, reflecting the compassionate nature of God and the teachings of Jesus.
