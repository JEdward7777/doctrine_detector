Certainly! The Bible presents numerous examples of individuals showing compassion, reflecting the values of empathy and kindness. Here are a few notable instances:

1. **The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37)**: In this parable, Jesus tells the story of a Samaritan who helps a wounded traveler. Despite cultural animosities between Samaritans and Jews, the Samaritan cares for the man's wounds and ensures he is taken to an inn for further care. This story highlights the importance of showing compassion across cultural and societal boundaries.

2. **The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32)**: This parable describes a father’s unconditional love and compassion for his wayward son. When the son returns home after squandering his inheritance, the father welcomes him back with open arms and a feast, demonstrating forgiveness and joy over the son’s return.

3. **Ruth and Naomi (Book of Ruth)**: The story of Ruth illustrates deep compassion and loyalty. After the death of her husband, Ruth chooses to stay with her mother-in-law Naomi, expressing her commitment to care for her. This act of kindness is foundational to the story and leads to Ruth becoming an ancestor of King David.

4. **Jesus Healing the Sick (Various passages, e.g., Matthew 14:14)**: Throughout the Gospels, Jesus frequently demonstrates compassion by healing the sick and feeding the hungry. For example, in Matthew 14:14, when he sees a large crowd, he is moved with compassion and heals their sick.

5. **David and Mephibosheth (2 Samuel 9)**: After becoming king, David seeks out anyone from the house of Saul to show kindness to for Jonathan's sake. He finds Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s disabled son, and brings him to live in the palace, granting him a place of honor and ensuring his needs are met.

6. **The Widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 17:8-16)**: The prophet Elijah encounters a widow during a time of drought and famine. Despite her own dire circumstances, she shares her last bit of food with him, and in return, God provides for her household throughout the famine. This mutual compassion highlights the importance of supporting one another.

These examples illustrate various forms of compassion, whether through direct acts of kindness, empathy towards others' suffering, or the nurturing of relationships. They emphasize the central value of caring for one another in diverse cultural and social contexts.
