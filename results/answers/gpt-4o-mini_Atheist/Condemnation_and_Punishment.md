## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Matthew 12:7 states, "But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless." This verse emphasizes the importance of mercy over strict adherence to ritualistic practices. It suggests that compassion and understanding should guide our actions, especially in moral and ethical judgments. The implication here is that punishment, particularly if it leads to condemnation without the possibility of redemption or forgiveness, is contrary to a more merciful and humane approach.

Similarly, Psalms 34:22 says, "The Lord redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned." This passage conveys a sense of hope and protection for those who seek refuge, indicating that there is a pathway to redemption and that condemnation is not the ultimate fate for individuals seeking grace. This perspective reinforces the idea that punishment should not be viewed solely as a means of retribution but rather as a potential moment for correction and growth.

Together, these teachings suggest a framework in which punishment is not about condemnation but rather about a call to mercy, redemption, and understanding. They invite a re-evaluation of punitive measures in society, encouraging a shift toward restorative justice practices that prioritize rehabilitation and community healing over mere punishment. This approach can foster a more compassionate society where individuals are supported in their journeys toward change, rather than merely being cast aside for their failures. In this light, punishment can be redefined from a tool of condemnation to an opportunity for transformation.
