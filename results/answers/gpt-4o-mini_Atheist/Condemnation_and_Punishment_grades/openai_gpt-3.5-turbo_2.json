  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively incorporates biblical passages and themes to address the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in the understanding of punishment. It accurately reflects the Christian worldview's emphasis on mercy, redemption, and the transformative power of punishment when viewed through a lens of compassion and understanding. The connection made between the teachings in Matthew and Psalms with the broader concept of restorative justice is well-argued and aligns with Christian principles. The response could have elaborated further on how divine justice and mercy intersect and harmonize within the context of punishment, but overall, it provides a thoughtful and insightful interpretation."
