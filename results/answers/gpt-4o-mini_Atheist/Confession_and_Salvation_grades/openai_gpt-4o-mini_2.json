  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough analysis of the theological implications of confessing Jesus as Lord and believing in his resurrection for salvation based on Paul's writings. It effectively connects the concepts of faith, public declaration, salvation as a process, and the lordship of Christ with the act of confessing Jesus as Lord. The structure is clear, and the explanation aligns well with a Christian worldview, highlighting the core elements of Paul's teachings on salvation."
