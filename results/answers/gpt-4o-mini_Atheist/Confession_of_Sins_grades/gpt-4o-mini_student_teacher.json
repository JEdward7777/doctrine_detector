  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful answer with practical strategies based on biblical principles for resisting temptation. However, their response did not directly address the importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness as the concern specified. It would have been stronger if they had emphasized the crucial step of confessing sins and relying on God's forgiveness as the reference answer from the teacher highlighted. Overall, a commendable effort in integrating biblical wisdom, but could have been more focused on the specified concern."
