  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the biblical concept of conscience, its nature, function, influence of Scripture, development, conflict, guidance, and role in the Christian community. They appropriately reference relevant Bible verses to support their points. However, the answer could have been improved by directly aligning their response more closely with the teacher's reference answer to ensure a stronger connection to the biblical definition of conscience as God's mechanism for guiding individuals in moral decisions."
