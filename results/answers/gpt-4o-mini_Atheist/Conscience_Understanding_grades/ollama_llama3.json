However, it does not fully develop the idea that conscience is an internal sense of right and wrong that guides individuals in their moral decision-making, as specified in the concern.\n\nThe response also could benefit from more explicit connections between the biblical passages provided (e.g., Romans 2:14-15) and the concept of conscience. Additionally, while it mentions the importance of Scripture and prayer for nurturing one's conscience, it could be expanded upon to provide a clearer understanding of how these practices influence moral discernment.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical concept of conscience, but could be improved through further development and connection-making."
