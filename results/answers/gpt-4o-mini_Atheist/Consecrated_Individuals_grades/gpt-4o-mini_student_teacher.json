  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate list of individuals consecrated to God in the Bible, including both well-known figures like Samson, Samuel, John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, and Paul the Apostle, as well as the Levites. However, the student's answer did not include the priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child, as mentioned in the reference answer. While the student's response was comprehensive, the omission of these key groups slightly lowers the grade."
