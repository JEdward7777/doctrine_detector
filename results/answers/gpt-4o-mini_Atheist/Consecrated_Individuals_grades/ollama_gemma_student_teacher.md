In the Bible, several individuals are described as being consecrated to God, often signifying a special dedication or setting apart for divine service or purpose. Here are a few notable examples:

1. **Samson** - In the Book of Judges, Samson was consecrated as a Nazirite before his birth and was dedicated to God to deliver Israel from the Philistines (Judges 13:5). His vow included abstaining from certain behaviors and substances.

2. **Samuel** - The prophet Samuel was dedicated to the Lord by his mother Hannah. She consecrated him for service in the temple, as recorded in 1 Samuel 1:27-28.

3. **John the Baptist** - While the Bible doesn’t use the term "consecrated" specifically, John is often understood to have been set apart for God’s purposes from birth, as indicated in the Gospels (Luke 1:15).

4. **Jesus Christ** - In a theological sense, Jesus is viewed as consecrated in his role as the Messiah. The New Testament portrays him as being appointed and devoted to God's mission of salvation (John 10:36).

5. **Paul the Apostle** - In the New Testament, Paul refers to himself as being "set apart" for the gospel of God (Romans 1:1). His life and mission were dedicated to spreading the message of Christianity.

6. **The Levites** - In the Old Testament, the tribe of Levi was set apart for priestly duties and service in the temple, making them a consecrated group (Numbers 3:5-13).

These individuals reflect various meanings of consecration, often involving a commitment to fulfill God’s will and purpose within the narrative of the Bible.
