  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of individuals consecrated to God in the Bible, citing specific examples and their significance. It demonstrates a clear understanding of consecration within the biblical context and effectively addresses the concern raised. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the distinction between being consecrated as individuals versus groups like priests, Israelites, and firstborn sons."
