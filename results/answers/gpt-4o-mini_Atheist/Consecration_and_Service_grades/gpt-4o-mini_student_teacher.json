  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer discussing various aspects of consecration, but there was a lack of emphasis on the purification process highlighted in the concern. While the student touched on transformation, moral standards, and community recognition, they did not explicitly address the cleansing aspect of consecration necessary for service to God from a Christian worldview. The answer could have been strengthened by placing more emphasis on the purification and cleansing aspects, aligning it closer to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
