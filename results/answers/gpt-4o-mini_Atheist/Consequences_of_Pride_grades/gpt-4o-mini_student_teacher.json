  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the consequences of pride and the importance of humility as depicted in various Bible passages and teachings. They have effectively highlighted the contrasting themes of pride leading to downfall and divine opposition, and humility leading to favor and exaltation. The examples and parables cited further reinforce the significance of humility in Christian teachings. However, the student could have directly incorporated the teacher's reference answer to further strengthen the biblical emphasis on God's role in humbling the proud and exalting the humble."
