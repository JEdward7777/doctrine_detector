## [Answer](../Consequences_of_Pride.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible contains several passages that address the themes of pride and humility, often contrasting the two and highlighting the consequences of pride alongside the virtues of humility.

1. **Consequences of Pride**: 
   - Proverbs 16:18 states, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." This verse illustrates the idea that pride can lead to one's downfall and misfortune.
   - James 4:6 mentions, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble." This suggests that pride not only estranges individuals from others but also incurs divine disfavor.

2. **Importance of Humility**: 
   - Philippians 2:3 encourages individuals to "do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves." This highlights the ethical importance of humility in fostering community and respect among individuals.
   - Matthew 23:12 states, "For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted." This reflects a theme of reversal, where humility is ultimately rewarded, while pride leads to a fall.

3. **Examples and Teachings**: 
   - The parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector (Luke 18:9-14) contrasts the pride of the Pharisee, who boasts about his righteousness, with the humility of the tax collector, who acknowledges his sinfulness. Ultimately, the tax collector is favored for his humility.
   - Jesus himself exemplifies humility, as seen in John 13, where he washes the disciples' feet, teaching that true greatness comes from serving others.

Overall, the biblical narrative presents pride as a dangerous vice that can lead to destruction, while humility is depicted as a virtue that invites grace and fosters constructive relationships.
