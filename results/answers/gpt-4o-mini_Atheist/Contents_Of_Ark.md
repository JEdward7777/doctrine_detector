## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Ark of the Covenant, a significant symbol in the Hebrew Bible, is traditionally described as containing three main items:

1. **The Tablets of the Law**: These are the two stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments, which were given to Moses on Mount Sinai.

2. **A Jar of Manna**: This jar contained manna, the miraculous food provided by God to the Israelites during their wanderings in the desert after the Exodus from Egypt.

3. **Aaron's Rod**: This was the staff of Aaron, the brother of Moses, which is noted for having blossomed as a sign of God's choice for Aaron’s lineage among the Levitical priests.

These items are mentioned in various passages of the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the Book of Exodus and Numbers, reflecting themes of divine guidance, provision, and priesthood. The Ark served as a physical representation of the covenant between God and the Israelites.
