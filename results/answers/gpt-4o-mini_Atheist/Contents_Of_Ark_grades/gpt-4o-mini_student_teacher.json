  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough and accurate description of the items contained within the Ark of the Covenant, including the Tablets of the Law, the Jar of Manna, and Aaron's Rod. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of these items in relation to God's covenant with the Israelites. The only slight deviation from the reference answer is the additional detail about Aaron's Rod blossoming as a sign of God's choice, which adds depth to the explanation without contradicting any Christian beliefs. Overall, the student's response shows a strong grasp of the topic and effectively communicates the importance of these items in reminding the Israelites of God's covenant."
