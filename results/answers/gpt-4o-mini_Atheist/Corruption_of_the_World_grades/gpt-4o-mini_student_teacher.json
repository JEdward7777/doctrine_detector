  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of ways Christians can identify corrupt influences in the world around them, encompassing various aspects such as biblical principles, community engagement, prayer, ethical standards, critical thinking, historical context, role models, and social justice movements. While the answer offers a well-rounded perspective, it could be improved by emphasizing the primary focus on examining behaviors and attitudes that contradict biblical teachings and promote selfishness and sin, as highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging greater alignment with the core biblical foundation in identifying corrupt influences would enhance the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
