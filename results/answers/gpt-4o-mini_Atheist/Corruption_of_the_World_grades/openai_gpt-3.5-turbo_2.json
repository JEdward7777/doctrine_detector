It effectively addresses the concern of remaining vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living by emphasizing the importance of aligning behavior and attitudes with biblical teachings. However, the response could have further emphasized the necessity of consistent prayer and reliance on discernment from God to guard against these influences."
