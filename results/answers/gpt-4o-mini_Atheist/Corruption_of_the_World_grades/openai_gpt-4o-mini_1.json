Each point highlighted in the response demonstrates a deep understanding of applying Christian principles to address corruption. The suggested strategies encompass a holistic view that encourages Christians to remain faithful to their beliefs while engaging with the world around them. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly tie each approach back to the concern of remaining vigilant against worldly influences."
