## Question [Covenant Conditions](../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)
What are some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible?

## Target answer from notes
An example of an unconditional covenant is God's promise to never destroy the earth again with a flood. In contrast, conditional covenants require obedience from the people, such as the covenant at Sinai where God said, 'If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant...'

## Concern to grade by
Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, covenants are agreements or promises made between God and humanity. They can be classified as either conditional or unconditional based on the nature of the promises given and the requirements for their fulfillment.

### Conditional Covenants
Conditional covenants require certain actions or behaviors from the parties involved in order for the promises to be fulfilled. Here are a couple of examples:

1. **The Mosaic Covenant**: This covenant, made between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-24), is conditional upon the Israelites following God's laws and commandments. God promises to bless them, protect them, and be their God, but failures to obey the covenant would lead to curses and consequences (Deuteronomy 28).

2. **The Davidic Covenant (1 Chronicles 28:7)**: While the overall promise to establish David's line is significant, the covenant is expressed with conditions for David's descendants to walk in God's ways. The fulfillment of God's promises regarding stability and kingship is contingent upon the obedience of David's heirs.

### Unconditional Covenants
Unconditional covenants are promises made by God that do not require specific actions or behaviors from the other party to be fulfilled. Examples include:

1. **The Noahic Covenant (Genesis 9:8-17)**: After the Flood, God made a covenant with Noah and all living beings, promising never to destroy the earth with a flood again. This covenant is unconditional and is symbolized by the rainbow, serving as a reminder of God’s promise regardless of human actions.

2. **The Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12:1-3, 15, 17)**: God made a significant promise to Abraham, assuring him of land, descendants, and blessings. While there are aspects of the covenant in which Abraham is called to respond (like circumcision), the overarching promise of land and descendants is unconditional, grounded solely in God’s commitment.

3. **The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Luke 22:20)**: This covenant, established through Christ, promises forgiveness of sins and a transformed relationship with God. Its fulfillment is not based on human actions but solely on the grace of God.

These examples reflect the diversity of covenantal relationships described in the biblical text, illustrating how they can vary in terms of conditions and requirements for fulfillment.
