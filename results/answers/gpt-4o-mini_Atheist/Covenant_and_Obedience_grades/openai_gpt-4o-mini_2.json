It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the role of obedience in achieving God's promises, emphasizing the covenantal relationship between God and His people, the moral and ethical framework provided by the laws, the divine guidance and protection associated with obedience, the preparation for entering the Promised Land, and the consequences of disobedience. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of obedience to God's commandments in the fulfillment of His promises. Well done!"
