The Jewish view of Gentiles (non-Jews) was complex and evolved over time, influenced by historical, religious, and social factors. Several cultural practices emerged around this relationship, particularly in the context of Second Temple Judaism, which had significant implications for early Christianity.

1. **Separation and Distinction**: Traditionally, Jews maintained a distinct cultural and religious identity, which was reinforced by practices such as dietary restrictions (kashrut), Sabbath observance, and rituals surrounding purity. Jews often viewed themselves as chosen people, which could lead to both a sense of superiority and exclusion of Gentiles.

2. **Attitudes of Acceptance and Rejection**: While there were strict boundaries, attitudes toward Gentiles varied within Jewish communities. Some, like the early Hellenistic Jewish philosophers (e.g., Philo of Alexandria), advocated for a more inclusive outlook, suggesting Gentiles could embrace Jewish monotheism and ethics. However, many Jews still held negative views of Gentiles, seeing them as impure or spiritually inferior.

3. **Proselytism**: There were movements within Judaism to convert Gentiles, a practice that was supported by the view that Godâ€™s covenant could extend to them. This included the acceptance of Gentiles who adhered to certain Jewish laws, often known as "God-fearers." These individuals played a significant role in early Christian communities, as they became initial followers of Jesus and later, promoters of the new faith.

### Impact on Early Christian Practices:

1. **Inclusivity of Gentiles**: One of the radical shifts that early Christianity introduced was the view that Gentiles could fully enter the faith without adhering entirely to Jewish law. This was a significant departure from traditional Jewish thought and fostered an inclusive community, as evidenced in the Acts of the Apostles, where the Apostle Peter received a vision that led him to accept Gentiles.

2. **Cultural Practices and Adaptation**: Early Christians often adopted certain cultural practices from Judaism while also integrating elements from Gentile cultures. This included the celebration of the Eucharist, which incorporated elements of Jewish meals but adapted for a broader audience. 

3. **Debates and Councils**: Disputes about the extent to which Gentile converts should follow Jewish law led to significant discussions, culminating in events like the Jerusalem Council (around 50 CE). The resulting decisions allowed many Gentiles to join without full adherence to the Torah, marking a foundational moment in establishing Christianity as a separate faith.

4. **Missionary Activity**: The early Christian movement actively sought to spread their message to Gentile populations. This marked a significant shift from the exclusive focus of some Jewish communities to a broader missionary outreach, leading to the proliferation of Christianity throughout the Greco-Roman world.

Overall, while the Jewish view of Gentiles often emphasized separation and distinction, the early Christians' engagement with these views transformed religious practices and societal structures, laying the groundwork for a faith that encompasses diverse cultures.
