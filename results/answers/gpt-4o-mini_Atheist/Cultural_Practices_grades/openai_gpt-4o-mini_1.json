The analysis is well-structured, highlighting key cultural practices and their impact on the development of Christianity. The response effectively addresses the concern about cultural norms influencing faith communities and their practices, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. However, the only minor deduction is for not explicitly addressing the inclusivity and acceptance discussions prompted by the initial barriers between Jews and Gentiles in the early church, as mentioned in the provided answer."
