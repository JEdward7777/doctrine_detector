  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the Jewish views on Gentiles and their impact on early Christianity. It explores the complexities of the relationship between Jews and Gentiles, highlighting key cultural practices and shifts within both communities. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the response back to the initial statement about Jews avoiding eating with Gentiles, connecting it with the broader discussion on inclusivity and acceptance in the early church."
