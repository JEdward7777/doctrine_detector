  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between curses, God's judgment, and the law in the context of Galatians 3:10. The student clearly explains the biblical basis for the concept of curses, their theological significance, and how Paul uses it to highlight the inadequacy of the law for salvation. The response is well-organized, articulate, and demonstrates a solid grasp of the Christian worldview."
