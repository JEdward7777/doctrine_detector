However, the response could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept to the specific Christian worldview of dying to self, bearing one's burdens for the sake of Christ, and embracing suffering for the sake of the Gospel. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to highlight the redemptive significance of the cross in the Christian faith, where Jesus' sacrificial death brings salvation and transforms the believer's understanding of suffering."
