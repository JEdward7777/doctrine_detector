The student effectively references relevant biblical passages and explains the theological significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of this promise. The explanation of the eternal nature of David's throne and its spiritual implications is well articulated. The response could benefit from delving deeper into the typological significance of Jesus as the \"Son of David\" and how his kingship fulfills Old Testament prophecies. Additionally, a more detailed exploration of how Christ's reign impacts believers' lives today and the future eschatological fulfillment could enhance the answer."
