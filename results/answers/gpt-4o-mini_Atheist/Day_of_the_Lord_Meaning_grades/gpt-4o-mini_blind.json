  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Day of the Lord\" in the New Testament, covering key aspects such as judgment, the second coming of Christ, hope for believers, and the preparatory call for vigilance. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the eschatological significance of this term within Christian theology. A slight improvement could be made by including more direct references to specific New Testament passages that discuss the \"Day of the Lord\" to further reinforce the points made."
