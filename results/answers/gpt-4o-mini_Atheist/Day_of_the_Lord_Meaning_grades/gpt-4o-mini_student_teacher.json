  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer that effectively captures the significance and implications of the 'day of the Lord' for believers. The response is thorough in discussing the themes of judgment, hope, the Second Coming, and the call for believers to be prepared. The student's connection of the 'day of the Lord' to divine justice and eschatological beliefs demonstrates a solid understanding from a Christian worldview."
