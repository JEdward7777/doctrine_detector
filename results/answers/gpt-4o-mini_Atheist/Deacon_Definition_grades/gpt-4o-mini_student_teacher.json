  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the primary roles of a deacon in a local church, encompassing various aspects of service, support, spiritual leadership, and community engagement. While their answer did touch on the biblical concept of servanthood through practical service and assisting church members in need, it lacked a direct emphasis on the specific biblical role of a deacon in serving fellow believers with practical needs such as food or money as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Encouraging the student to further emphasize the biblical perspective on the role of deacons in meeting practical needs within the church would strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
