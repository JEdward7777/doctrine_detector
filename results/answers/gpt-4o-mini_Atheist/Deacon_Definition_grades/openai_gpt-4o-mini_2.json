The mention of practical service in the answer aligns well with the emphasis on servanthood in the church, as deacons are called to serve and support fellow believers in practical ways. The response could be enhanced by incorporating more specific references to biblical teachings on servanthood and how this principle underpins the role of deacons in the church. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
