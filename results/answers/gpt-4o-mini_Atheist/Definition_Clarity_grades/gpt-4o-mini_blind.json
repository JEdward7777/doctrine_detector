The student accurately references key passages from both the Old and New Testaments, demonstrating a comprehensive grasp of the theological implications of adultery. The inclusion of Jesus' teachings on adultery expands the explanation further, showing how the concept extends beyond mere physical actions to encompass the heart and mind. The focus on breach of trust and commitment aligns well with Christian doctrine on marriage and covenant relationships. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound explanation. Great job!"
