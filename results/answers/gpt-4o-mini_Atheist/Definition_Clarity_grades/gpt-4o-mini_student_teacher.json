  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of how adultery is defined in the Christian context according to Scripture. They accurately reference key passages from both the Old and New Testaments that address adultery and its implications. The student also acknowledges the broader dimensions of adultery beyond just the physical act, incorporating the aspects of trust, commitment, mercy, and forgiveness.\n\nThe student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer; however, the student's response provides a more detailed explanation by including references to specific verses and elaborating on the spiritual and moral implications of adultery in the Christian faith. Overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the Biblical definition and implications of adultery from a Christian worldview."
