## [Answer](../Definition_Clarity.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Christian context, the term 'adultery' is primarily defined as a violation of the marital covenant, specifically involving sexual relations between a married person and someone who is not their spouse. The foundational texts addressing adultery in Scripture can be found in both the Old and New Testaments.

1. **Old Testament References**: 
   - The commandment "You shall not commit adultery" appears in Exodus 20:14 as part of the Ten Commandments. This commandment establishes adultery as a sin against both oneâ€™s spouse and God.
   - In Leviticus 20:10, the consequences for adultery are outlined, emphasizing its serious nature within the community.

2. **New Testament References**:
   - Jesus expands on the understanding of adultery in Matthew 5:27-28, where he teaches that even looking at someone with lustful intent is equivalent to committing adultery in the heart. This interpretation broadens the definition beyond physical acts to include mental and emotional dimensions.
   - In John 8:1-11, Jesus encounters a woman accused of adultery but refrains from condemning her, illustrating themes of mercy and forgiveness while still affirming the seriousness of the sin.

Overall, in the Christian tradition, adultery is understood not just as a physical act, but as a breach of trust and sacred commitment, holding both spiritual and moral implications.
