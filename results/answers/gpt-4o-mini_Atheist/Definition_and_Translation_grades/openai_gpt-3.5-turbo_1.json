  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful exploration of alternative translations and terms related to the concept of intercession in different contexts. It effectively addresses the concern by offering a comprehensive range of terms and explanations to clarify the meaning and application of intercession. The inclusion of scriptural references or examples could enhance the response further, but overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
