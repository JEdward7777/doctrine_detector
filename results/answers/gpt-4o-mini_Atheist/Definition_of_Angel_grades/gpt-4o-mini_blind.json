  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of the biblical definition of angels and their primary roles. The student accurately captures the multifaceted nature of angels as messengers, protectors, warriors, worshipers, guides, and helpers based on biblical references. The answer could be further enhanced by including more scriptural references to support each point and by emphasizing the hierarchical nature of angels in relation to God's divine order. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
