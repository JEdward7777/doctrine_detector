## [Answer](../Definition_of_Angel.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the biblical context, an angel is typically defined as a messenger of God. The term "angel" comes from the Greek word "angelos," which means "messenger," and the Hebrew word "mal'akh," which carries the same meaning. Angels are spiritual beings created by God who serve various roles, primarily acting as intermediaries between God and humans.

The primary roles of angels in the Bible include the following:

1. **Messengers**: Angels often deliver messages from God to individuals. For example, the angel Gabriel announces the birth of Jesus to Mary (Luke 1:26-38) and the angel delivers messages to Daniel in the Book of Daniel (Daniel 9).

2. **Protectors**: Angels are depicted as guardians who provide protection to people. Psalm 91:11-12 speaks of God commanding angels to guard and protect those who trust Him.

3. **Warriors**: Angels are also described as warriors who carry out God's judgments and fight against evil. In Revelation 12:7-9, Michael and his angels battle against the dragon (often interpreted as Satan).

4. **Worshipers**: Angels worship and glorify God. In Isaiah 6:1-3, angels are seen praising God in His heavenly throne room, emphasizing their role in the divine hierarchy.

5. **Guides and Helpers**: Angels may guide and assist individuals in times of need, as seen in stories like those of the angel who frees Peter from prison in Acts 12.

Overall, biblical angels play a multifaceted role in conveying God's will, protecting and aiding believers, and participating in the heavenly worship of God.
