It aligns well with the concern that understanding the role of angels can deepen faith and provide assurance of God's protection and guidance. The response could have further emphasized the importance of faith in God as the foundation for seeking angelic protection and guidance, but overall, it effectively integrates a Christian worldview perspective."
