  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the term 'church' in the New Testament, emphasizing its focus on the community of believers rather than a mere physical structure. The student effectively discusses the Greek word \"ekklesia\" and its implications, as well as key aspects of the church as the Body of Christ, its functions, roles, and mission. The answer could be further strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
