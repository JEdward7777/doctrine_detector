  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and insightful answer that aligns well with the Christian view of the church as a community of believers rather than a mere physical structure. They effectively emphasize the spiritual and communal aspects of the church as portrayed in the New Testament, highlighting its roles, functions, and mission. The student's understanding of the church's role as more than just a building is clear and well-supported in their response."
