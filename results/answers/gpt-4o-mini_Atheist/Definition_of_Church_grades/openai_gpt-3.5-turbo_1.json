  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and thorough explanation of the New Testament concept of the church as a community of believers united in faith rather than just a physical structure. It accurately addresses the concern by highlighting the church's role as the Body of Christ, emphasizing worship, fellowship, teaching, and mission. The only minor improvement could be a direct reference to the role of the church as more than just a building in the earlier parts of the response to fully align with the concern."
