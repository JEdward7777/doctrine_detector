  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the New Testament's portrayal of the church as a community of believers rather than a physical structure, emphasizing the spiritual and communal aspects of the church. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the church's role in embodying values, serving the wider community, and fostering relationships among believers. The only minor point for improvement would be to directly link the concept of the church as more than just a building to the given answer for greater clarity and cohesiveness."
