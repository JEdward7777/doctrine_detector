## [Answer](../Definition_of_Church.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, the term 'church' primarily refers to the community of believers in Jesus Christ rather than a physical structure. The Greek word used is "ekklesia," which translates to "assembly" or "congregation." This term emphasizes the gathering of individuals who are united in faith and practice, rather than indicating a specific building or institution.

The New Testament presents the church as the Body of Christ, where believers collectively participate in worship, fellowship, teaching, and the sharing of the sacraments. The Apostle Paul, for instance, extensively discusses the functions and roles within the church, highlighting themes of unity, diversity of gifts, and mutual support among its members.

Additionally, the New Testament portrays the church as having a mission to spread the teachings of Jesus and serve the wider community, embodying values like love, compassion, and justice. As such, the concept of the church is both spiritual and communal, focusing on relationships among believers and their collective identity as followers of Christ.
