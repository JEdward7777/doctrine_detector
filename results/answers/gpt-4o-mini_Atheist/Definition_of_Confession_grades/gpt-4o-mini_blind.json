  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of confession according to the Bible. It correctly emphasizes acknowledgment of sin, moral responsibility, restoration of relationships, and the distinction between private and public confession. The integration of relevant Biblical verses such as 1 John 1:9 and James 5:16 adds depth to the explanation. However, to improve, the student could further emphasize the aspect of genuine repentance and the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator for forgiveness, as these are crucial components of confession from a Christian worldview."
