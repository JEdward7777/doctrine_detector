  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student demonstrated a solid understanding of the biblical concept of confession by highlighting key aspects such as acknowledgment of sin, moral and spiritual responsibility, restoration of relationships, and the distinction between public and private confession. They supported their points with relevant biblical references which show a good grasp of the topic. However, the answer could have been improved by incorporating the teacher's reference answer, which emphasized a more concise definition of confessing as admitting or asserting the truth. By aligning their response more closely with the reference answer in terms of clarity and conciseness, the student could have achieved a higher grade."
