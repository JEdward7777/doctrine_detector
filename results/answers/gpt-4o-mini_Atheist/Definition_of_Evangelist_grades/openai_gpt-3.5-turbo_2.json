  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately defines the literal meaning of \"evangelist\" as \"someone who preaches the good news,\" aligning well with the concern of understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel. The additional explanation provided about the term's association with the Christian tradition and its broader sense adds depth to the response and shows a comprehensive understanding of the concept."
