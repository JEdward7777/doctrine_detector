  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90.\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"evangelist\" as someone who preaches the good news, highlighting its origin and significance within the Christian tradition. It effectively addresses the concern by explaining the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel. The context and understanding of the term from a Christian perspective are well-articulated. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how evangelists embody the message of Jesus Christ in their actions and words, tying the concept back to its spiritual and doctrinal implications."
