  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound overview of the characteristics and nature of God as depicted in the Bible. The student effectively integrates key biblical passages to support their points and presents a thorough understanding of God's attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, morality, love, sovereignty, holiness, immanence, covenantal nature, and the Trinity. The inclusion of scriptural references further strengthens the response and demonstrates a solid foundation in biblical theology. Well done!"
