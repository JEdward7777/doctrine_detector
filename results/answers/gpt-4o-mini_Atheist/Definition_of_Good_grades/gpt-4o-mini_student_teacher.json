  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured explanation of the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil,' incorporating relevant scripture references and examples to support their points. The student's answer effectively contrasts the concepts of 'good' and 'evil' within a Christian worldview, addressing the concern of understanding the moral implications of these terms in daily decision-making. However, the student's response could have been strengthened by directly aligning their explanations with the teacher's reference answer, emphasizing the moral rightness and wrongness aspect of 'good' and 'evil' as highlighted in the reference answer."
