## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The term 'gospel' comes from the Old English word "godspel," which translates to "good news" or "great news." This, in turn, is derived from the Greek word "euangelion," meaning "good message." 

In the context of the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the term 'gospel' refers specifically to the accounts of the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as presented in the four canonical gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each of these texts presents a unique perspective on Jesus' life, emphasizing different aspects of his message and impact.

More broadly, the gospel encompasses the theological implications of Jesus’ message, particularly the themes of salvation, redemption, and the Kingdom of God. It speaks to the belief that through Jesus' life and sacrifice, individuals can have a restored relationship with God, which is central to Christian faith. In this way, the gospel is seen not just as a collection of stories, but as a profound theological framework that calls for a response from its audience. 

While primarily a Christian term, the concept of 'gospel' can also resonate in a more general sense as an announcement of significant and positive news, impacting various cultural and social contexts, even outside of a religious framework.
