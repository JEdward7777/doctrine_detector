  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the term 'gospel' both linguistically and in biblical context. They accurately describe the origin of the term and its significance in the New Testament, emphasizing the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The answer also effectively touches on the broader theological implications of the gospel, such as salvation and the Kingdom of God. However, the mention of the gospel resonating in general contexts outside of Christianity could be expanded upon or clarified further to prevent misconceptions about the exclusivity and significance of the gospel message within Christian faith."
