  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'gospel' and its significance in the Christian faith. They accurately discussed the etymology of the word and its theological implications, including themes of salvation, redemption, and the Kingdom of God. However, there was some additional information included that slightly deviated from the core concept of the gospel as 'good news' about God's salvation through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. Overall, a solid understanding was demonstrated, but a bit of refocusing on the central message could have improved the response."
