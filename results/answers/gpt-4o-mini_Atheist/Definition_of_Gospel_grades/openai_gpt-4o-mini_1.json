  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term 'gospel,' emphasizing its literal meaning as 'good news' and its significance in Christian faith, specifically highlighting God's salvation through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. The answer effectively addresses the concern by clearly articulating the definition and importance of the Gospel within a Christian worldview. Additional mention of the broader theological implications and historical context of the term could have further enriched the response, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
