  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible, touching on key theological and cultural implications. However, the answer goes beyond the specific concern of understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture. The student's explanation is well-developed and insightful, but it could have been more focused on directly addressing the prescribed concern."
