## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" generally refers to individuals who are regarded as holy or set apart for God. The Greek word used for "saints" is "hagios," which means "holy" or "sacred." Throughout the New Testament, "saints" is often used to describe members of the Christian community, emphasizing their identity as people who have been called by God and who strive to live according to His teachings.

The term is used in various letters attributed to the Apostle Paul, such as in Romans 1:7, where Paul addresses the "saints" in Rome, and in Philippians 1:1, where he greets all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi. In this context, being a saint is not limited to a select few but is an identity all believers share through their faith in Jesus Christ. It highlights the idea of a community of believers who are called to live out their faith in a manner reflective of Christ's teachings, embodying virtues such as love, compassion, and righteousness. 

This understanding of "saints" does not necessarily align with later Christian traditions that may depict saints as individuals having performed extraordinary deeds or miracles. In the New Testament, the emphasis is more on the communal and collective aspect of holiness among believers rather than on individual sanctity or achievement.
