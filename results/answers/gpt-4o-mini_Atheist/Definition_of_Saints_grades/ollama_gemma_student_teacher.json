They accurately define the term as individuals regarded as holy or set apart for God, and explain the significance of the Greek word \"hagios.\" The student also provides relevant examples from Paul's letters, highlighting the inclusive nature of the term as an identity shared by all believers. Additionally, the student correctly points out that the New Testament emphasis is on the communal and collective aspect of holiness among believers rather than individual sanctity or achievement."
