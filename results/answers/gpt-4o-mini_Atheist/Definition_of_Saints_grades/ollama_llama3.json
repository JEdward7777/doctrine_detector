  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response accurately conveys the biblical definition of \"saints\" as individuals who are regarded as holy or set apart for God, highlighting the collective aspect of holiness among believers. The mention of the Greek word \"hagios\" and its meaning of \"holy\" or \"sacred\" further supports this understanding.\n\nThe response also effectively contrasts this biblical definition with later Christian traditions that may have emphasized individual sanctity or achievement. This is particularly relevant to the concern about distinguishing between cultural and scriptural interpretations, as it encourages readers to prioritize a scripturally-based understanding of saints over cultural or denominational influences.\n\nOne area for improvement could be to provide more explicit connections between this biblical definition of saints and its implications for Christian life and practice. However, overall, this response provides a clear and accurate treatment of the topic that addresses the specified concern."
