It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the correct biblical definition of saints to differentiate between cultural and scriptural interpretations. Additionally, it demonstrates a solid grasp of the Christian worldview and the communal aspect of holiness among believers as portrayed in the New Testament. Great job!"
