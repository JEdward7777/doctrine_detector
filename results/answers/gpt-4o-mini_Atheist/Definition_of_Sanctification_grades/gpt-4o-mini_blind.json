  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of sanctification according to the Bible, touching on both its Old and New Testament significance, the cultural implications, and the spiritual aspects. The biblical definitions are well articulated, and the discussion on sanctification as a process and state of being is clear. The cultural significance and spiritual implications are also effectively communicated. One area for improvement could be to include more references to specific Bible verses to reinforce the points made. Overall, a solid and informative response."
