  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the biblical concept of sanctification. They have included relevant biblical references, discussed the process and implications of sanctification, and connected it to cultural significance. The only slight improvement would be to align the answer more closely with the concise reference definition provided by the teacher."
