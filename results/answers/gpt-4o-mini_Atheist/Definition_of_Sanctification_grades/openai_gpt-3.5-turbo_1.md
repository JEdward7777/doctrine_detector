## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the biblical context, to sanctify or to be sanctified generally means to be set apart for a sacred purpose or to be made holy. This concept appears throughout the Bible and encompasses both a process and a state of being.

1. **Biblical Definitions**: 
   - **Sanctification as a Process**: In the New Testament, sanctification is often viewed as both a positional and progressive process. Positional sanctification occurs at the moment of faith when a believer is declared holy through their relationship with Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 6:11). Progressive sanctification refers to the ongoing work of becoming more aligned with God's will and character throughout one's life (2 Peter 3:18).
   - **Old Testament Context**: In the Hebrew Bible, the concept of holiness is central to the understanding of God, and objects, people, and places that are sanctified are set apart for God's use (Exodus 19:6, Leviticus 20:26). The Sabbath, for instance, is described as sanctified by God.

2. **Cultural Significance**: 
   - **Setting Apart**: Sanctification is not just about moral purity; it involves being dedicated to the divine. This idea resonates with broader themes of belonging and commitment within various cultures, where certain aspects of life or experience are considered sacred and worthy of reverence.
   - **Community and Identity**: For many religious communities, sanctification serves as a marker of identity, influencing practices, rituals, and community cohesion. The call to live a sanctified life is often tied to communal standards and values.

3. **Spiritual Implications**: 
   - For believers, being sanctified can lead to a deeper relationship with the divine and a sense of purpose. It often encourages ethical behavior and personal transformation, which are important dimensions of community and individual identity within various cultural contexts.

In summary, to sanctify or be sanctified according to the Bible is about being set apart for a divine purpose, reflecting a journey of spiritual growth and deepening one's relationship with the sacred. This concept interweaves with cultural understandings of what it means to be devoted and to live in accordance with higher principles.
