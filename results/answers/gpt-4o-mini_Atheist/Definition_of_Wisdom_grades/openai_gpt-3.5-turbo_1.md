# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the biblical context, wisdom is often portrayed as a multifaceted concept that encompasses not only knowledge and understanding but also moral and ethical dimensions. Several key themes emerge when examining biblical definitions of wisdom:

1. **Fear of the Lord**: A foundational aspect of biblical wisdom is the fear of the Lord. Proverbs 9:10 states, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." This implies that wisdom begins with a reverence and respect for God, recognizing His sovereignty and authority.

2. **Knowledge and Understanding**: Wisdom involves a deep understanding of God's laws and the world. In Proverbs 2:6, it is stated, "For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding." This highlights the importance of seeking knowledge and gaining insight into moral and ethical living.

3. **Practical Application**: Wisdom is not just theoretical; it must be applied in everyday life. The book of Ecclesiastes reflects on the importance of living wisely and making choices that align with virtuous living. James 3:13 emphasizes that true wisdom is demonstrated through good conduct and deeds done in humility.

4. **Moral Integrity**: Wisdom in the biblical sense also involves moral integrity and righteousness. It includes making decisions that align with ethical standards and fostering relationships characterized by peace, humility, and love (James 3:17).

5. **Guidance and Counsel**: Wisdom is often associated with the ability to provide sound counsel and guidance to others. In Proverbs 15:22, it is noted that "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers, they succeed." This underscores the value of wise leadership and collaboration.

6. **Long-term Perspective**: Biblical wisdom often takes a long-term view, considering the consequences of actions and the moral implications of decisions. This is seen in passages that encourage individuals to think about their legacy and their eternal fate, emphasizing the transient nature of worldly pursuits.

Overall, biblical wisdom is a combination of understanding, moral integrity, reverence for God, and the practical application of knowledge in daily life. It encourages individuals to seek a deeper relationship with the divine and to live in a manner that is honorable and beneficial to themselves and others.
