  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of biblical wisdom, covering key themes such as the fear of the Lord, knowledge, practical application, moral integrity, guidance, and a long-term perspective. It effectively aligns with the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the biblical concept of wisdom for making decisions that align with God's will. The only area for improvement would be to directly incorporate the given answer and explicitly tie it back to the biblical context throughout the response."
