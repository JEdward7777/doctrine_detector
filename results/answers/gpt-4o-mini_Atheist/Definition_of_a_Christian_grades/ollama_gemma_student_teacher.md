## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Christian.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The biblical definition of a "Christian" can be derived from both the New Testament and the early historical context of the term. The word "Christian" itself appears in the New Testament in Acts 11:26, where it is said that the followers of Jesus were first called Christians in Antioch. This indicates that the term was used to identify the disciples of Jesus Christ.

From a broader biblical perspective, a Christian is generally understood to be someone who:

1. **Follows Jesus Christ**: Christians believe in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who came to save humanity. This foundational belief is articulated in passages like John 3:16, which highlights the belief in Jesus as essential for salvation.

2. **Embraces the teachings of Jesus**: Christians strive to live according to the teachings found in the Gospels and the New Testament letters, which emphasize love, compassion, and ethical living.

3. **Participates in a community of believers**: The early Christians gathered for worship, support, and fellowship (as seen in Acts 2:42-47), reflecting the communal aspect of the faith.

4. **Experiences spiritual transformation**: Many Christians believe in the necessity of a personal transformation or conversion experience, often described in the context of being "born again" (John 3:3) or receiving the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).

In summary, a Christian, according to the Bible, is essentially a follower of Jesus Christ who believes in his teachings, participates in a community of faith, and experiences a transformative relationship with God.
