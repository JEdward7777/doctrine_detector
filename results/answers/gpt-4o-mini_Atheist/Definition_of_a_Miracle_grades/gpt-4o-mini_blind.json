  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student gives a general overview of the concept of miracles, touching on their supernatural nature and association with divine intervention. However, the response falls short in providing a distinctly Christian perspective on miracles and God's authority. It lacks a robust theological foundation and fails to emphasize the centrality of God's sovereignty and omnipotence in the working of miracles. Additionally, the student introduces secular perspectives that may create confusion regarding the supernatural and divine nature of miracles. A stronger emphasis on the Christian worldview and the biblical understanding of miracles in relation to God's authority would improve this response."
