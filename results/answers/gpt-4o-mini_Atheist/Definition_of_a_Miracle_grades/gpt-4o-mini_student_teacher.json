  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of miracles, including different perspectives and interpretations. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on God's direct intervention and authority as the basis for miracles, which is central to a Christian worldview. The student could strengthen their argument by more explicitly connecting miracles to God's authority and power."
