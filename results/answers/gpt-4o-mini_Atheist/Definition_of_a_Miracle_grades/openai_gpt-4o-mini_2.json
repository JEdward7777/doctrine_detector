  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of miracles from both a religious and secular perspective, acknowledging different interpretations and roles miracles play in various contexts. While it does not explicitly focus on deepening faith and acknowledgment of God's power as the concern specified, it accurately captures the significance of miracles, particularly in affirming God's authority and power. The response would benefit from a stronger emphasis on how understanding miracles can specifically deepen faith and acknowledgment of God's power within a Christian worldview."
