The student effectively covers the covenantal relationship, identity and community, moral and ethical living, historical narrative, and prophetic tradition aspects of being part of the 'people of God.' The answer is clear, detailed, and accurately reflects the theological and social implications of this concept in the Old Testament. Great job!"
