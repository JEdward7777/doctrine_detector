# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Old Testament, the phrase "people of God" generally refers to the Israelites, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This designation carries profound theological, social, and cultural implications. 

1. **Covenantal Relationship**: Being considered one of the "people of God" means being part of a special covenant with God. In this context, the covenant includes commitments and responsibilities outlined primarily in the Law (Torah), including the Ten Commandments and other statutes. God promises protection, guidance, and blessings in return for worship and adherence to His laws.

2. **Identity and Community**: The Israelites see themselves as a distinct community chosen by God, set apart from other nations. This identity is reinforced through various practices, rituals, and symbols (such as circumcision, dietary laws, and observance of the Sabbath) that reflect their unique relationship with God.

3. **Moral and Ethical Living**: Being part of the "people of God" also involves living in a way that reflects God's holiness and justice. This includes caring for the marginalized, such as the widows and orphans, and upholding communal laws that emphasize fairness and righteousness.

4. **Historical Narrative**: The Israelites' identity as God's people is deeply intertwined with their historical experiences, including the Exodus from Egypt, the conquest of Canaan, the establishment of the monarchy, and the eventual exile. These narratives serve to reinforce their perception of themselves as a chosen people under divine guidance.

5. **Prophetic Tradition**: Throughout the Old Testament, prophets call the people back to fidelity to their covenant with God, emphasizing repentance and righteousness. This prophetic voice underscores the dynamic nature of what it means to be part of the "people of God," as it is not merely about ethnic identity but also about moral and spiritual fidelity.

In summary, to be considered one of the "people of God" in the Old Testament entails being part of a covenantal relationship with God, sharing a specific communal identity, adhering to God's moral and ethical guidelines, and participating in a historical and prophetic narrative that shapes that identity.
