  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response does provide some general definitions for each term, it lacks depth and precision in its explanations. Additionally, the concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture is not fully addressed. The provided answer is also somewhat simplistic and doesn't capture the nuances of each term as thoroughly as a more comprehensive breakdown would.\n\nThe response does provide some useful information, such as the connotations associated with each term, but it could be improved by providing more specific biblical examples or verses that illustrate the proper use of these forms of encouragement."
