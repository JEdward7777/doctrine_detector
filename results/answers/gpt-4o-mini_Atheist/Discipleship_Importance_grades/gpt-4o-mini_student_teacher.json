However, the answer could have been more explicit in emphasizing the central role of the apostles in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church, which aligns with a Christian specific worldview. The student effectively explores the contextual significance but could have linked these factors back to the crucial aspect of the apostles' role in the New Testament more directly."
