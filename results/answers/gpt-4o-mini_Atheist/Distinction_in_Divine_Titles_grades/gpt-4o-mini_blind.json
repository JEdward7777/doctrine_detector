  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively highlights the theological, cultural, and linguistic reasons for not translating 'Lord Yahweh' as 'Lord LORD'. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of the name 'Yahweh' in the biblical texts and provides thorough explanations to support the importance of maintaining the distinction. The response could be strengthened by including more direct scriptural references to support the points made, further grounding the argument in biblical authority."
