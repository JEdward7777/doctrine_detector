It addresses the concern by emphasizing the potential for confusion and misunderstanding that may arise if the distinction is not maintained. The only potential improvement could be a stronger connection to a Christian-specific worldview, such as highlighting the theological implications of accurately representing God's name and identity in translations for believers."
