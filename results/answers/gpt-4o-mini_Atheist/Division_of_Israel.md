## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
After King Solomon's reign, one of the major events in Israel's history was the division of the united kingdom into two separate kingdoms: the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south. This division occurred around 931 BCE, shortly after Solomon's death, largely due to political and economic tensions among the tribes of Israel.

The north, Israel, comprised ten tribes and was ruled by Jeroboam, while the south, Judah, included the tribes of Judah and Benjamin and was ruled by Rehoboam, Solomon's son. This division led to significant political, social, and religious differences between the two kingdoms, culminating in various conflicts, shifts in power, and ultimately, the fall of both kingdoms to external empires (the Assyrians conquered Israel in 722 BCE, and the Babylonians conquered Judah in 586 BCE). The consequences of this division were profound, influencing the historical, cultural, and religious landscape of the region.
