  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing the historical and political context surrounding the division of Israel after King Solomon's reign. They accurately discussed the division into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah, highlighting key figures and the eventual conquests by external empires. However, there was some additional speculation on specific social and religious differences between the two kingdoms that were not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer. It would have been beneficial for the student to focus more on the historical and spiritual significance specifically mentioned in the concern. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic was demonstrated."
