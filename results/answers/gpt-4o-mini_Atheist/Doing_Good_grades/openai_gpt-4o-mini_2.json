The integration of the Parable of the Good Samaritan and the directive to love neighbors and enemies adds depth to the analysis and illustrates the ethical and moral obligations inherent in living out one's faith through good deeds. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of Christians manifesting their faith through practical acts of kindness and service."
