  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: This response adequately explains the biblical concept of humanity's dominion over the earth, emphasizing stewardship and responsible care. The student correctly mentions the importance of interpreting dominion as a call for responsible management rather than exploitation. However, the response could have been strengthened by including more references to specific biblical passages and theological perspectives that shape the understanding of dominion. Additionally, a clearer connection to Christian doctrine and teachings on creation care could have been made to enhance the theological depth of the answer."
