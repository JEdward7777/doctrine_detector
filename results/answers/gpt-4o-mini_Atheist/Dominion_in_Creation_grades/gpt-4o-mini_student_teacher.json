  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the concept of humanity's dominion over the earth based on the biblical text. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the responsibility for stewardship and care of creation as laid out in Genesis. The student also effectively connects this biblical teaching with modern interpretations and perspectives on environmental ethics. A slight deduction is made for the additional interpretations provided that go beyond the specific concern of understanding our God-given authority over creation, but overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview."
