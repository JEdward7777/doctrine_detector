## [Answer](../Dominion_in_Creation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, presents the concept of humanity having dominion over the earth in Genesis 1:26-28. In these verses, God creates humans in His image and grants them authority over the earth and its creatures. The passage states that humanity is to "be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it," and it emphasizes stewardship over all living things.

This idea is often interpreted as a call for responsible management and care of the planet and its resources rather than a license for exploitation. The notion of dominion has led to various interpretations throughout history. Some view it as a mandate for humans to exercise control and resource use, while others interpret it more as a responsibility to care for and protect creation.

In more contemporary discussions, this theme has been linked with environmental ethics, emphasizing the importance of sustainable practices that respect the integrity of ecosystems and all forms of life. Many faith-based movements have emerged that align with ecological consciousness, advocating for stewardship that honors the interconnectedness of all creation. 

Therefore, while the biblical text speaks to humanity's dominion, modern interpretations often stress responsibility, care, and a balanced relationship with the environment.
