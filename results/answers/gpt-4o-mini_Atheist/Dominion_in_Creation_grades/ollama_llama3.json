It also acknowledges the various interpretations of this concept throughout history and its connection to environmental ethics and sustainability. However, it could be more detailed in its explanation of what responsible management and care of creation looks like in practice. Additionally, while it mentions faith-based movements advocating for stewardship, it does not provide a clear example or practical application of how Christians can exercise their God-given authority over creation responsibly.\n\nThe response mostly addresses the concern by highlighting the biblical command to have dominion over creation and emphasizing the importance of responsible management and care. However, it could be more explicit in providing guidance on how to exercise this authority wisely."
