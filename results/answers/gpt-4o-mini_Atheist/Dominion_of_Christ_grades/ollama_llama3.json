  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of Jesus' dominion as described in the Bible, covering various aspects such as spiritual authority, kingship, shepherd-like care, and judgment. While it does not explicitly state that Jesus functions as prophet, priest, and king, which is mentioned in the answer, it does provide detailed explanations of these themes. The response effectively recognizes the authority of Christ in all aspects of life, emphasizing its impact on faith. The only deduction is for not directly addressing the specific aspect of Christ's multifaceted role mentioned in the answer."
