In the Bible, the dominion of Jesus Christ is described in various ways, reflecting both his spiritual authority and his ultimate role in the eschatological (end times) context. Here are some key aspects:

1. **King of Kings and Lord of Lords**: In Revelation 19:16, Jesus is referred to as "King of kings and Lord of lords," suggesting his supreme authority over all rulers and nations.

2. **Spiritual Authority**: In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of his authority in a spiritual sense. For example, in Matthew 28:18, after his resurrection, he declares, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me." This indicates his dominion over both the spiritual and earthly realms.

3. **Shepherd and Leader**: Jesus is often depicted as a shepherd who leads and cares for his followers. In John 10:11, he refers to himself as "the good shepherd," emphasizing the protective and guiding nature of his dominion over his followers.

4. **Eternal Kingdom**: The Bible also speaks of the establishment of God's kingdom through Christ. In Luke 1:32-33, the angel Gabriel tells Mary that her son will "reign over the house of Jacob forever," pointing to an everlasting dominion.

5. **Judgment**: In the context of eschatology, Jesus is described as having the authority to judge. In Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus speaks of the Son of Man coming in his glory to separate the righteous from the unrighteous, asserting his judicial dominion.

In summary, the dominion of Jesus Christ, as described in the Bible, encompasses spiritual authority, kingship, shepherd-like care for his followers, and the ultimate role of judge in the final judgment. These themes showcase a multifaceted understanding of his dominion, both in the present and the future.
