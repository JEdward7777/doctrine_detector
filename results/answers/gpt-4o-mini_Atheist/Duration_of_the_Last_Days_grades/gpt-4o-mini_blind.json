  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85 \n\nComment: The student has provided a well-reasoned and accurate explanation regarding the concept of \"the last days\" in the Bible. They correctly point out that the duration of the last days is not explicitly defined in Scripture, and acknowledge the different interpretations surrounding this period among scholars and theologians. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural references related to the last days. However, it could have been strengthened by including more specific references or interpretations from within the Christian tradition. Overall, a solid response."
