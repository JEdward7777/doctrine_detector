However, it lacks a clear application of how this uncertainty can impact how Christians should live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return from a Christian worldview perspective. More emphasis on the importance of living faithfully and being prepared for Christ's return despite the unknown timeframe would have strengthened the response."
