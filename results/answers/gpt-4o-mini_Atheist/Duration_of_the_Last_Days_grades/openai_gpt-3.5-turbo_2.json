  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the ambiguity surrounding the duration of \"the last days\" in the Bible and acknowledges the various interpretations among scholars and theologians. It appropriately addresses the concern by highlighting how uncertainty about the duration of the last days can impact how Christians approach their faith and live in anticipation of Christ's return. The response could have further emphasized the importance of readiness and faithfulness in the present moment regardless of the uncertainty of the timeline of the last days."
