## [Answer](../Duration_of_the_Last_Days.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of "the last days" in the Bible is not defined by a specific duration. Various scriptures refer to this period, but they do not provide a clear timeline. For instance, the term is used in passages like 2 Timothy 3:1, which states, "But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty." Similarly, Hebrews 1:2 mentions that God has spoken to us "by his Son in these last days."

The ambiguity surrounding the duration of the last days has led to different interpretations among scholars, theologians, and religious communities. Some view this period as beginning with the life and resurrection of Jesus and extending until the second coming, while others consider it to be a future, more defined timeframe.

Overall, the Bible doesn't specify exactly how long "the last days" will last, leaving the interpretation open to various theological perspectives.
