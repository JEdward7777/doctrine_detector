  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod. The student accurately identifies the key materials such as gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and linen. They also explain the significance of these materials well in the context of ancient Israelite religious practices. However, it would have been beneficial to include specific references to the biblical passages that describe these details to further solidify the answer. Overall, well done."
