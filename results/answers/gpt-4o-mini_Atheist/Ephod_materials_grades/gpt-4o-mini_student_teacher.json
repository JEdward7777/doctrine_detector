  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod, highlighting their significance and symbolism. While their response was thorough and well-researched, the inclusion of linen as a component was not mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Therefore, a slightly lower grade is given."
