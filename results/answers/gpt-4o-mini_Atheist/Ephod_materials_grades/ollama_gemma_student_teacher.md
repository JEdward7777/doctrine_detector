The high priest's ephod, as described in the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the book of Exodus, was made from a combination of materials. Specifically, it was constructed from:

1. **Gold**: Gold threads were used in the weaving of the ephod, giving it a rich and sacred appearance.
  
2. **Blue, Purple, and Scarlet Yarn**: These specific colors were commonly used in ancient Israelite textiles. They were derived from various natural sources and were significant in terms of their symbolism and the wealth they represented.

3. **Linen**: Fine linen was also a key component, adding durability and a soft texture to the garments.

The ephod was worn by the high priest during religious ceremonies and was an important item that represented their role in mediating between the people and God. The details about this garment highlight the significance of artistry and craftsmanship in ancient religious practices.
