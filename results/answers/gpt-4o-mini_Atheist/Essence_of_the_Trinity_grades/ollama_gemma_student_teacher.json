  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of the Trinity within Christian theology. It accurately explains the essential nature of the Trinity as a unity of three persons within one divine essence. The student clearly articulates the relational distinctions between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit while emphasizing their shared essence. The historical development of the doctrine is also briefly but appropriately mentioned. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of the Trinity in Christian faith and practice."
