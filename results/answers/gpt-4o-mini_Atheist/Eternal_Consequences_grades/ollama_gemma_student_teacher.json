  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the term \"perishing\" from a Christian perspective. They provide a comprehensive overview of the various interpretations of the concept in religious and philosophical contexts. However, the response lacks clarity in addressing the specific concern of eternal separation from God, as it does not explicitly address the concept of eternal punishment in hell as specified in the reference answer."
