  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does touch on the idea of eternal separation from God, it only briefly mentions hell as the consequence for those who perish. It does not fully explore the gravity of this concept or its implications for human existence. The response also spends significant time discussing secular and philosophical perspectives on \"perishing\", which while relevant to understanding cultural and individual beliefs, may dilute the focus on eternal separation from God.\n\nThe comment I would give is:\n\n\"This response shows some understanding of the concept of perishing as it relates to eternal separation from God, but could benefit from more development and emphasis on this specific concern. The discussion of secular perspectives while relevant, may not fully address the gravity of this issue.\""
