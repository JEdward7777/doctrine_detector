It acknowledges the Christian belief in eternal separation from God for those who perish, aligning with the concern about understanding the seriousness of this consequence. However, there is some ambiguity in not explicitly emphasizing the gravity of eternal separation from a Christian worldview perspective, which could have been strengthened by clearly articulating the implications of this belief in relation to the severity of rejecting divine grace."
