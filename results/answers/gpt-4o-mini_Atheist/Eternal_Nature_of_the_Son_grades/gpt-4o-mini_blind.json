  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the distinction between the 'Son of God' and human sons from a Christian theological perspective. The student effectively highlights the differences in nature of existence, eternal nature, and role/function between the 'Son of God' and human sons. The response could be enhanced by incorporating scriptural references to support the theological points made and by delving deeper into the doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation. Overall, a strong and well-articulated answer."
