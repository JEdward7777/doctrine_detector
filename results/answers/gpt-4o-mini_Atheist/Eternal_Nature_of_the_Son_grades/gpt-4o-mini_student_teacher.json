  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the distinction between the 'Son of God' and human sons in terms of theological interpretations within Christianity. The response effectively discusses the nature of existence, eternal nature, and role and function of the 'Son of God' compared to human sons. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God, as emphasized in the given concern. Overall, a solid explanation with room for slight refinement."
