  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer effectively addresses the concern of emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God. The student provides a thorough and well-reasoned explanation of the distinctions between the 'Son of God' and human sons in terms of their nature, existence, and roles. However, the student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific aspect mentioned in the reference answer, namely Jesus' involvement in the creation of the world."
