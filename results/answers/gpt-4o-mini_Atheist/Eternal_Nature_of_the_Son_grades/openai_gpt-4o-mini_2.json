It clearly articulates the distinct nature of Jesus as the divine Son compared to human sons, highlighting the eternal and uncreated essence of the Son of God. The explanation aligns well with the Christian worldview's understanding of Jesus Christ as part of the Holy Trinity and central to the doctrine of salvation."
