From a Christian worldview, eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice as a consequence of sin and rejection of His grace, not merely as a counterpart to free will or a matter of accountability for choices.\n- The answer should have emphasized the biblical foundation for the concept of eternal punishment in hell and the importance of God's holiness, righteousness, and justice in dealing with sin.\n- The inclusion of alternative theological interpretations like annihilationism and universalism, without clearly contrasting them with the orthodox view, detracts from the doctrinal accuracy of the response."
