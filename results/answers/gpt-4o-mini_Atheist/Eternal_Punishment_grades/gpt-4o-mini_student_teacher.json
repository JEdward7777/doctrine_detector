  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student addresses various perspectives on the concept of eternal punishment in hell and acknowledges different theological interpretations, their response lacks a clear alignment with a Christian worldview. The central focus on human perspectives, cultural nuances, and moral objections detracts from the primary Christian belief that hell exists as a consequence for rejecting Jesus Christ. The student does not emphasize the foundational Christian teachings about salvation, sin, and the need for reconciliation with God through faith in Jesus. Therefore, the answer falls short in fully addressing the concern of divine justice and mercy within a Christian framework."
