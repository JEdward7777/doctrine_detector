  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of eternal punishment in hell and its relationship to divine justice. They acknowledge the theological debates and cultural variations in perspectives on the issue. However, their answer could benefit from a clearer articulation of how their Christian worldview informs their interpretation of divine justice and the concept of hell. Additionally, their response does not directly address the specific concern raised about the compatibility of eternal punishment with the nature of divine mercy."
