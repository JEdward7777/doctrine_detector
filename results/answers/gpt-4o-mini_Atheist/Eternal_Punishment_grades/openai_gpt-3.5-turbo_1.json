It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and presents differing views while maintaining respect for the foundational belief that rejection of Jesus leads to eternal punishment. However, the response could benefit from explicitly affirming the Christian view of eternal punishment as a reflection of God's justice and mercy, and emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus for salvation."
