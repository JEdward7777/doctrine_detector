  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful exploration of the concept of eternal punishment in hell from various theological and cultural perspectives, addressing concerns about the nature of divine justice and mercy. The inclusion of alternative theological interpretations of eternal punishment adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could have included more explicit references to Christian scripture or doctrine to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective on the issue."
