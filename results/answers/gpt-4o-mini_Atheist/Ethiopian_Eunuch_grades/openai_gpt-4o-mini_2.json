It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the early Church's openness to individuals from diverse backgrounds and its mission to extend God's acceptance to all who believe, in line with Christian teachings on inclusivity and the universal scope of salvation. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian principles and effectively applies a Christian worldview to interpret the biblical narrative."
