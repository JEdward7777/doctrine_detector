They have discussed various aspects such as the historical context of eunuchs, the voluntary aspect of celibacy, and the broader implications of Jesus' words. However, the response could be improved by incorporating more explicit references to biblical passages and Christian teachings on celibacy to strengthen the doctrinal understanding. Additionally, emphasizing the biblical view of celibacy as a gift or calling from God would enhance the theological depth of the explanation."
