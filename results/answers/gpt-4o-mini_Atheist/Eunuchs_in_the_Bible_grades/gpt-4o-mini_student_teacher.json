  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 and effectively connects it to the concept of celibacy. They demonstrate a good understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and present insightful interpretations of the passage. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly referencing Jesus acknowledging the reasons for individuals being eunuchs, as stated in the teacher's reference answer. Nonetheless, the student's analysis and insights show a solid grasp of the topic."
