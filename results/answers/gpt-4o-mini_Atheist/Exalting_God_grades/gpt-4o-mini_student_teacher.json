  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of what it means to exalt God in daily life, exploring various ways this can be manifested. However, the student's answer lacked a clear focus on worship, prayer, and living according to God's will as the central aspects of exalting God, which are emphasized in the reference answer given by the teacher. The student effectively addressed the importance of exalting God through moral conduct, gratitude, spiritual practices, serving others, studying sacred texts, creating a positive environment, and acts of worship, but could have strengthened the response by placing greater emphasis on the core components highlighted by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept but could have aligned the response more closely with the specific Christian viewpoint provided in the reference answer."
