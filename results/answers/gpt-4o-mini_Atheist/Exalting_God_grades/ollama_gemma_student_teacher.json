  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of exalting God from a Christian perspective. It provides clear examples of how this can be expressed in daily life through both actions and attitudes. The inclusion of broader cultural contexts adds depth to the discussion. While the response aligns well with the reference answer, it could benefit from a more explicit statement of how the actions mentioned directly honor and praise God."
