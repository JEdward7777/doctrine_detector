However, the response could be enhanced by further elaboration on the theological implications of the parable, such as the connection to the two greatest commandments given by Jesus or the deeper spiritual lessons it conveys. Additionally, tying the parable more explicitly to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ would strengthen the overall theological depth of the explanation."
