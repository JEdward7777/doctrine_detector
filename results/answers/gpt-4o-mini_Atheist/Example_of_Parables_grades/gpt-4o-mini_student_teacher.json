  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the Parable of the Good Samaritan, highlighting its significance in challenging societal norms, emphasizing universal compassion, moral obligation, and the response to legalistic attitudes. The response effectively connects the parable to its relevance today by stressing the importance of acting with love and compassion towards others regardless of social or cultural differences. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific moral lesson of love and compassion for one's neighbor as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
