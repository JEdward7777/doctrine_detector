## [Answer](../Example_of_Parables.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Certainly! One of the most well-known parables told by Jesus is the Parable of the Good Samaritan, found in Luke 10:25-37. 

### Summary of the Parable:
In this parable, a man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho is attacked by robbers, who strip him of his clothes, beat him, and leave him for dead. A priest and a Levite, both respected figures in Jewish society, see the man but choose to pass by on the other side of the road without helping him. However, a Samaritan, who would have been traditionally viewed with disdain by the Jewish audience, stops to help the wounded man. He tends to his wounds and takes him to an inn, where he pays for his care.

### Significance:
1. **Universal Compassion:** The parable emphasizes that compassion and love should transcend ethnic and social boundaries. The Samaritan's actions challenge the audience to reconsider their prejudices and the idea of who is a "neighbor."

2. **Moral Obligation:** Jesus uses this story to illustrate that true faith is demonstrated through actions of kindness and mercy rather than through religious rituals or status. It emphasizes that one's moral obligations extend beyond one’s own community or religious identity.

3. **Response to Legalism:** This parable was told in response to a question about how to inherit eternal life, which highlights the importance of love—both for God and for others—as central to ethical behavior and spiritual fulfillment.

4. **Cultural Context:** During Jesus’ time, Jews and Samaritans had significant animosity towards each other. By making the Samaritan the hero of the story, Jesus challenges societal norms and invites listeners to reflect on their biases.

Overall, the Parable of the Good Samaritan serves as a timeless reminder of the importance of compassion and the need to act benevolently towards others, regardless of their background.
