  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate response, citing specific biblical examples of demon possession and explaining their significance within the narratives. The examples chosen align with traditional Christian beliefs regarding demon possession as understood from the Bible. The only suggested improvement would be to expand slightly on the theological implications of demon possession within the context of spiritual warfare and the overarching redemptive work of Christ. Overall, a solid response."
