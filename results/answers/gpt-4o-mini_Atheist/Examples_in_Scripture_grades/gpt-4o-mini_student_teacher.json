  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer with a score of 85.\n\nWhile the student provided detailed examples from the Bible illustrating instances of demon possession and connected them to broader theological purposes in the New Testament, the answer could have been improved by including additional references such as the ones mentioned in the teacher's answer (Mark 1:32, Matthew 4:24, and Matthew 8:33). By incorporating these references, the student's response would have been more comprehensive and aligned with the concern of understanding the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of demon possession in the Bible but could have enhanced their answer by including a broader range of references."
