  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive list of examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt, tying each narrative to the theme of guilt effectively. The explanations are clear and demonstrate an understanding of the moral lessons conveyed in each story. The student could improve the response by incorporating more direct scriptural references to enhance the doctrinal correctness, but overall, the answer shows a strong grasp of the concept of guilt as portrayed in the Bible."
