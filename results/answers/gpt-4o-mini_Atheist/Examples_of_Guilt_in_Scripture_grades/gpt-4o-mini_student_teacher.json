However, the answer did not directly address the concern mentioned by the teacher. While the examples mentioned were relevant and showcased different aspects of guilt, they did not specifically highlight how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment as requested. A stronger connection to the concern and a reflection on the divine justice aspect would have enhanced the answer."
