  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe provided response provides a more detailed and nuanced discussion of Jesus' miracles, highlighting their significance and theological implications. The list of specific miracles and their corresponding significance aligns with the concern of recognizing the importance of Jesus' miracles in believing Him as the Son of God.\n\nHowever, while the response does mention the divinity of Jesus and the nature of faith, it could be further developed to explicitly connect these ideas to the concern of recognizing His divinity. The provided answer, for example, only mentions that Jesus' miracles serve as signs of His divinity, but the response could have delved deeper into how this relates to our understanding of God's kingdom and our faith in Him.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of Jesus' miracles and their relevance to our belief in Him. With some further development and connection to the concern, it could be considered an excellent response."
