However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the foundational aspect of belief in Jesus for Christians, which is the acceptance of Jesus as the only way to salvation through His sacrificial death and resurrection. This central doctrinal truth should have been given more prominence in the explanation. Additionally, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the role of repentance and surrender to Christ in the act of believing in Him."
