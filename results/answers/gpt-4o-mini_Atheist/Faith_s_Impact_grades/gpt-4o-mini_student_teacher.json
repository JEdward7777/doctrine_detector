  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of manifestations of true faith in Jesus, which align well with the Christian worldview. However, there was a lack of emphasis on the role of the Holy Spirit in producing these manifestations, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student successfully addressed the concern of recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life but could have further emphasized the importance of the Holy Spirit's work in producing good spiritual fruits."
