  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively examines how the Bible teaches about the sanctity of marriage, the importance of faithfulness, and how adultery violates this sacred covenant. It also highlights specific passages and teachings that emphasize these principles. The inclusion of consequences of adultery and the message of forgiveness and restoration add depth to the analysis. The only minor area for improvement would be to include a bit more on the practical application for Christians in maintaining integrity and faithfulness in their marriages, such as through prayer, communication, accountability, and relying on the grace of God."
