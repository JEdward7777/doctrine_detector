They addressed the concern by emphasizing the importance of transparency, fairness, and open communication in relationships to mitigate the negative effects of favoritism. However, the student could have incorporated more explicitly Christian principles or references to biblical teachings on favoritism to align the response more closely with a Christian worldview."
