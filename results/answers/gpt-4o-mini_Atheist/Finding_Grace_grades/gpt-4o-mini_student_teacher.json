The response shows a good understanding of grace as favor and mercy from God. However, the student could further enhance their answer by focusing more on how one can actively seek and recognize God's favor in their life, as per the specified concern. Additionally, the response could have included more specific references to biblical examples or teachings to strengthen the Christian perspective."
