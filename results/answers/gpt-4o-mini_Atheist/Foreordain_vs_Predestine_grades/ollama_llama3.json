The concern is to clarify the relationship between similar theological concepts, but the given answer only provides a superficial distinction without exploring the deeper connections or implications between the two terms. To improve this response, it would be necessary to delve further into the scriptural foundations, historical context, and theological debates surrounding these concepts, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their interplay."
