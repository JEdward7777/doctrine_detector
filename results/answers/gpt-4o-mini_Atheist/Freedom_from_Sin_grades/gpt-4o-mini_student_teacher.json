  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer addressing the ways in which being 'bound' by sin can hinder a Christian's relationship with God and offered practical steps for finding freedom from these bonds. They incorporated Christian teachings on confession, repentance, grace, prayer, community support, professional guidance, service, and forgiveness, which align well with the reference answer from the teacher. The response could have been improved by emphasizing the centrality of repentance and faith in Jesus for experiencing true freedom and restoration, as noted in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
