1. **Love** - A selfless, unconditional care for others.
2. **Joy** - A deep-seated sense of happiness and contentment, regardless of circumstances.
3. **Peace** - A state of tranquility and calmness, fostering harmony within oneself and with others.
4. **Patience** - The ability to endure difficult situations and the willingness to wait without frustration.
5. **Kindness** - Compassionate and considerate behavior towards others.
6. **Goodness** - Moral integrity and a commitment to doing what is right.
