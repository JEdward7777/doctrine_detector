The student effectively references scriptural passages from both the Old and New Testament to support their points. The emphasis on how keeping promises reflects one's faith, integrity, and devotion is well articulated. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the consequences of not fulfilling vows, as mentioned in passages like Numbers 30:2 and Deuteronomy 23:21-23. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound answer. Great work!"
