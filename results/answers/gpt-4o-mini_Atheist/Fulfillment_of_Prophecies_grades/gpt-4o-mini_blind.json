The explanation is clear and covers various dimensions of the topic. However, the response could benefit from more direct references to specific biblical examples of fulfilled prophecies to enhance clarity and doctrinal relevance. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the foundational role of God's sovereignty in prophecy fulfillment and the connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of messianic prophecies would bring more doctrinal correctness to the discussion."
