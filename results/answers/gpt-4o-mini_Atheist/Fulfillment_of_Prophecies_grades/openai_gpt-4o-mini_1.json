While the explanation does not explicitly mention God causing the fulfillment of prophecies as stated in the given answer, it aligns well with the understanding of how God interacts with prophecy in Scripture by emphasizing the divine plan, ongoing revelation, and community affirmation. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview in interpreting the fulfillment of prophecies."
