  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-articulated response exploring various interpretations of \"holy places\" beyond traditional religious structures. However, from a Christian worldview, the primary understanding of a holy place remains one that is set apart for God's worship and sacred purposes. While the student's answer is informative and shows a deep understanding of diverse perspectives on sacred spaces, it could have been enhanced by emphasizing the centrality of God's presence in defining holiness within a Christian framework."
