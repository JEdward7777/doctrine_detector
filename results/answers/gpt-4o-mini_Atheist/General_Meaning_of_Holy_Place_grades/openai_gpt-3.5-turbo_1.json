The broader interpretations presented are valid in a general sense, but they do not directly address the concern of identifying places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter within a Christian context. Incorporating examples of Christian holy sites, such as churches, cathedrals, or shrines, and how they foster encounters with the divine would have strengthened the response from a Christian-specific perspective."
