While the answer expands upon the concept in a nuanced and comprehensive manner, it does not explicitly tie back all the aspects discussed to the central concern of identifying places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounters. More emphasis on how these broader interpretations relate to the core idea of spaces set apart for God and worship would enhance the alignment with the specified concern."
