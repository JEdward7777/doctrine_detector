  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the characteristics that distinguish evangelists from other Christians, including their focus on evangelism, the gift of evangelism, active engagement in ministry, theological emphasis, relational approach, and diverse methods. However, the student's response lacks a direct connection to the spiritual gifts related to evangelism as highlighted in the reference answer. It would have been stronger if the student had explicitly linked the characteristics mentioned to the idea of a special spiritual gift for evangelism. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but falls slightly short of addressing the spiritual gifts aspect in depth."
