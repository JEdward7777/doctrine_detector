While it does not explicitly state that some Christians are given a special spiritual gift to effectively tell the gospel to others, the response does acknowledge the importance of a \"gift\" in evangelism (point 2). The concern about understanding spiritual gifts related to evangelism is also partially addressed by the mention of the \"gift of evangelism\" and its role in enabling effective communication of the Christian message. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more direct support for the idea that some Christians have a special spiritual gift for evangelism."
