  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of practical ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily lives, aligning well with the concern of honoring God's greatness. However, the reference answer emphasizes the importance of sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments as key ways to glorify God. The student's response could have been stronger if it had focused more on these specific aspects highlighted in the reference answer."
