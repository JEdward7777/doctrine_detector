  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThis response largely aligns with the given answer, emphasizing that glorifying God can involve living according to His character and commandments, as well as sharing testimonies of His goodness. The various practices listed in the response provide concrete examples of how believers can reflect God's glory in their daily lives.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is by more directly tying each practice back to the concern of honoring God's greatness. While it is implicit that these practices are meant to glorify God, a more explicit connection would strengthen the response and make it more impactful.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a thoughtful and comprehensive exploration of how believers can live out their faith in a way that honors God's greatness."
