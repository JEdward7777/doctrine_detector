The focus on integrating faith into various aspects of life, such as integrity, compassion, prayer, gratitude, and community involvement, demonstrates a holistic approach to reflecting God's glory. However, while the response covers a broad spectrum of actions believers can take, it could benefit from further connecting these actions to the specific aspect of reflecting God's greatness and how each contributes to this overarching goal."
