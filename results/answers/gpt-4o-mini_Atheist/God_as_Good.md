## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The statement "There is only one who is good, and that is God" comes from the New Testament, specifically in passages like Mark 10:18 and Luke 18:19. In this context, Jesus is responding to a question about the nature of goodness, particularly in light of someone addressing him as "Good Teacher."

From a scholarly perspective, this statement can be unpacked in several ways:

1. **Theological Implication**: Jesus is emphasizing the absolute standard of goodness, which is identified with God. This distinction highlights the belief that human notions of goodness are relative and fallible compared to the divine nature.

2. **Christological Significance**: By acknowledging God's unique position as the only one who is truly good, Jesus might also be alluding to his own identity. Those who interpret this passage in light of Christian doctrine might see it as an implicit expression of his divine nature, especially when considering the broader message of the New Testament that depicts Jesus as both fully divine and fully human.

3. **Moral Discourse**: This statement invites reflection on moral authority. It raises questions about the nature of morality and ethics, encouraging believers and scholars alike to contemplate the source of goodness, how it is defined, and how it can be practiced in daily life.

4. **Cultural Context**: From a historical perspective, Jesus was speaking to a Jewish audience that had a firm understanding of God’s nature as good, holy, and just according to their scripture. This affirmation resonated within the Jewish tradition and contrasted with the moral frameworks of surrounding cultures.

In sum, Jesus’ declaration about goodness invites an exploration of the relationship between humanity, morality, and the divine, and it continues to be a point of reflection in theological discussions today.
