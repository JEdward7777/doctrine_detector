  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the source of goodness as God, which aligns with the specified concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. The explanation also delves into various theological implications, christological significance, moral discourse, and cultural context, providing a comprehensive understanding of Jesus' statement.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have more explicitly emphasized the connection between God's goodness as the ultimate standard and its application in daily life. While the text does mention the invitation for reflection on moral authority and morality, it could be further developed to illustrate how this concept can guide our actions and beliefs.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of Jesus' statement and provides thoughtful insights into its significance, making it a strong 85 out of 100."
