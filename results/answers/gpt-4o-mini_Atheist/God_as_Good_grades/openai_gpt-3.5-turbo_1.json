  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the statement \"There is only one who is good, and that is God\" from a Christian perspective, highlighting theological, Christological, moral, and cultural implications. The analysis effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs by exploring the divine standard of goodness exemplified by God. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly tie back each point to the concern raised, but overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
