## [Answer](../God_s_Compassion.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible presents a multifaceted view of God's nature, including His compassion. Several passages highlight this aspect:

1. **God's Mercy and Compassion**: Throughout the Bible, God is often depicted as merciful and compassionate. For example, in Psalm 103:8, it states, "The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love." This portrays God as one who cares deeply for humanity and is inclined to forgive and show mercy.

2. **The Parable of the Good Samaritan**: In the New Testament, Jesus emphasizes compassion through the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37). In this story, a Samaritan helps someone in need despite social divisions, illustrating the expectation for humanity to act with compassion and mercy, reflecting God's nature.

3. **God's Concern for the Vulnerable**: Various biblical texts highlight God's particular concern for the vulnerable and marginalized, such as orphans, widows, and foreigners (e.g., Deuteronomy 10:18, Psalm 68:5). This indicates that God's compassion extends to those who are often overlooked or oppressed.

4. **Jesus as the Manifestation of Godâ€™s Compassion**: In the Gospels, Jesus is portrayed as embodying God's compassion, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and caring for the destitute. Matthew 9:36 notes, "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."

These examples collectively illustrate that the Bible describes God as intrinsically compassionate, urging believers to emulate this attribute in their dealings with others.
