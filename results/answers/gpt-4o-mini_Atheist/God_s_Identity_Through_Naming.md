The concept of being 'called by my name' can be understood in various contexts, reflecting the deep and multifaceted relationship individuals may have with the divine. In religious texts, particularly within the Judeo-Christian tradition, this phrase often denotes a personal and intimate relationship between God and individuals. Here are a few key points that illustrate this relationship:
