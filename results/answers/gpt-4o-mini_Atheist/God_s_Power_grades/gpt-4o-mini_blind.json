  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the term \"Almighty\" in relation to God's nature, highlighting key attributes such as omnipotence, sovereignty, transcendence, and reliability. The inclusion of examples from different religious traditions adds depth to the analysis. However, a few minor adjustments could enhance the response, such as incorporating specific references to relevant biblical passages or theological interpretations within Christianity to strengthen the doctrinal accuracy. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview would further align the response with the prompt's focus on a Christian-specific perspective."
