  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides some helpful strategies for self-reflection and personal growth, it lacks a Christian-specific perspective on discerning God's plan. The answer does not incorporate prayer, scriptural guidance, or seeking counsel from mature Christians, which are foundational aspects of discerning God's plan within a Christian worldview. The focus on secular and cultural approaches detracts from the Christian perspective needed to address the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose."
