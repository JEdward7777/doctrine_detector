However, it does not address the concern raised about believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose from a spiritual standpoint. From a Christian worldview, prayer, guidance from the Bible, seeking counsel from mature Christians, and discerning God's plan based on circumstances are key components in understanding one's purpose. It is important to emphasize the significance of seeking God's will and trusting in His plan for believers who may be experiencing spiritual uncertainty."
