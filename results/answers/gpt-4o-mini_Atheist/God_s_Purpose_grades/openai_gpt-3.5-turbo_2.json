However, from a Christian worldview, the focus is mainly on self-reflection, philosophical and psychological insights, and cultural narratives, which may not fully address the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose. The response lacks emphasis on seeking God's guidance through prayer, reading the Bible, and seeking counsel from mature Christians, key elements in discerning God's plan according to Christian beliefs. It could benefit from incorporating more Christian-specific guidance to address the concern raised regarding believers experiencing spiritual uncertainty."
