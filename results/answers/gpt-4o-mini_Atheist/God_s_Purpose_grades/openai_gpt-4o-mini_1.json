From a Christian worldview, relying solely on personal agency and exploring various philosophical and cultural influences may not fully address the deep spiritual longing for understanding God's plan and purpose for one's life. Integrating elements of prayer, seeking wisdom from mature Christians, and aligning one's life with biblical guidance are essential components for Christians to navigate feelings of spiritual uncertainty and to discern God's plan. It is important to consider the spiritual dimension when addressing concerns related to believers' understanding of their purpose in life."
