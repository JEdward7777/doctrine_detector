## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, God introduces Himself in various ways, often using different names that reflect His nature, character, and relationship with humanity. Here are some significant instances:

1. **YHWH (Yahweh)**: This is the most frequently used name for God in the Old Testament, often referred to as the Tetragrammaton. In Exodus 3:14, when Moses asks God for His name, God responds, "I AM WHO I AM," indicating His eternal existence and self-sufficiency. This name embodies the idea of God as the self-existing one.

2. **Elohim**: This is a general term for God used in the creation narrative (Genesis 1:1), emphasizing His power and sovereignty. The plural form can signify majesty and greatness.

3. **El Shaddai**: Translated as "God Almighty," this name conveys God's might and ability to provide and nurture (Genesis 17:1). It reflects His role as a protector and sustainer.

4. **Adonai**: Meaning "Lord" or "Master," this name highlights God's authority and lordship over creation (Psalm 8:1).

5. **Jehovah Jireh**: This name means "The Lord will provide" (Genesis 22:14) and indicates God's provision for His people in times of need.

6. **Abba**: In the New Testament, Jesus referred to God as "Abba," meaning "Father," which emphasizes a personal, intimate relationship with God (Mark 14:36; Romans 8:15).

7. **The Alpha and the Omega**: In Revelation 22:13, God identifies Himself with the beginning and the end, underscoring His eternal nature and sovereignty over all time.

These names and titles provide insight into how God presents Himself throughout the biblical narrative, demonstrating various attributes such as power, provision, intimacy, and authority. Each name holds significance, enriching the understanding of the divine in a cultural and historical context.
