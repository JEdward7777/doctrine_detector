  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment:\nThe student's answer effectively explores the relationship between God's timing and our expectations in life by highlighting key points on how understanding the concept of 'appointed time' can enhance faith in God's plans. The response demonstrates a strong connection between the concept of appointed times and faith in God's sovereignty and plan. The student provides relevant examples and explanations to support their points, showing a clear understanding of the topic. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly referencing the concern provided and explicitly tying back to the reference answer from the teacher. This connection would have made the student's points more cohesive and aligned with the specified concern."
