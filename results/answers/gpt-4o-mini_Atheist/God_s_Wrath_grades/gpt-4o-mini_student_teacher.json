  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of the Day of Yahweh and accurately captured the various aspects associated with God's punishment during that time. However, the answer did not directly address the specific concern raised in the reference answer, which focused on God's wrath being poured out upon those who do not believe. The student's response would benefit from more direct engagement with the reference answer to align their explanation more closely with the Christian worldview perspective on the consequences for disbelief."
