The mention of punishment as a 'pouring out of God\u2019s wrath' aligns well with the idea of divine judgment and consequences for disbelief, as God's wrath is often seen as a form of judgment for those who reject Him. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the seriousness of God's judgment and the implications for those who do not believe."
