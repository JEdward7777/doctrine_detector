  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70. While the student provides a thorough and insightful explanation of \"zeal of the Lord\" from both biblical and scholarly perspectives, there is a slight deviation from the concern provided. The answer delves deeply into the broader cultural context and implications of zeal, which, although interesting, somewhat detracts from focusing solely on how recognizing God's zeal can deepen believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being. The answer could have been improved by connecting each point back explicitly to the concern given. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept and provides valuable insights."
