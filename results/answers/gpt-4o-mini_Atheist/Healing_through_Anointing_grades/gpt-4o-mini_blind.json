  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded and insightful explanation of how anointing is related to healing in the New Testament. They effectively connected biblical references, cultural context, and the symbolic significance of anointing with oil to demonstrate its role in physical and spiritual healing. The student could enhance their answer by delving deeper into the theological implications of anointing and incorporating more direct scriptural examples that explicitly tie anointing to healing in the ministry of Jesus."
