  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provided a well-rounded and detailed explanation of the practice of anointing related to healing in the New Testament, incorporating relevant biblical references, cultural context, symbolic significance, and the holistic approach to healing. The student effectively connected the act of anointing with both physical and spiritual healing, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the topic. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the teacher's answer and explicitly stating that anointing with oil symbolizes the request for God's intervention and healing power, as that was the specific concern mentioned. Nonetheless, the student's response was informative and insightful, earning a high grade."
