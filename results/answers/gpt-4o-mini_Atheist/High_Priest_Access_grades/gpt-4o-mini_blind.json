  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of who was allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant and under what circumstances in the biblical tradition. It correctly references key passages from the Hebrew Bible and highlights the significance of the High Priest, ceremonial cleanliness, the role of the Levites, and the consequences of irreverence. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the doctrinal principles surrounding the Ark's sanctity and access restrictions. Great job!"
