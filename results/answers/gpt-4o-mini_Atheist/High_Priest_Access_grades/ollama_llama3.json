  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately highlights that only the high priest could approach the Ark, which aligns with the given answer. Additionally, it provides more context by mentioning the specific occasion (Day of Atonement) and the importance of ritual purity. The mention of the Levites' role in transporting the Ark is also relevant to the topic.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not delve deeper into the significance of the high priest's role in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant. While it mentions the Day of Atonement, it could explore more how this event represents the high priest's intermediating role between humanity and God. The response also could have expanded on the implications of the high priest's unique access to the Ark for understanding the nature of God's presence among the Israelites.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some useful context, it does not fully engage with the concern about recognizing the high priest's role in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant."
