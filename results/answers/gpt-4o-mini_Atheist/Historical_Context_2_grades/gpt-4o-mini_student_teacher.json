The response showcases a comprehensive view of the cultural and religious importance of this practice. However, the answer lacks a direct acknowledgment of God's specific instruction as the primary reason for eating unleavened bread, which is essential from a Christian worldview where divine intervention plays a crucial role in shaping historical events. Further alignment with the teacher's reference answer would strengthen the student's response."
