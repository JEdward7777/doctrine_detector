## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt due to the urgency of their situation. According to the biblical narrative, specifically in the Book of Exodus, they were instructed to prepare for their hasty departure from slavery. Leaven, which is used to make bread rise, requires time to ferment, and the Israelites did not have the luxury of waiting for their bread to rise. 

As a result, they made unleavened bread, or matzah, which could be prepared quickly and eaten on the go. This practice also took on significant religious meaning, symbolizing both the haste of their escape and their subsequent liberation from bondage. The observance of unleavened bread is central to the Jewish festival of Passover, commemorating this pivotal event in their history. 

From a cultural perspective, the practice has endured as a means of remembering and reflecting on themes of freedom, resilience, and the importance of community in the face of oppression.
