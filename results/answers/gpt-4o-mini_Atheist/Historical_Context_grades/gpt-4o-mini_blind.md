## [Answer](../Historical_Context.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of the "remnant" is a significant theme in the biblical texts of Isaiah and Amos, reflecting the idea of a faithful minority that remains after a period of judgment or calamity. Here are some key events and passages that illustrate this concept:

1. **Isaiah's Vision of the Remnant**:
   - In Isaiah 1:9, the prophet states, "Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a few survivors (or a remnant), we would have been like Sodom, and we would have become like Gomorrah." This highlights that even in the face of widespread unfaithfulness and impending judgment, God preserves a faithful group.

2. **The Call to Repentance and the Remnant**:
   - Throughout the Book of Isaiah, particularly in chapters 6 and 10, the concept of the remnant is evident. In Isaiah 6:13, after a vision of God, Isaiah prophesies that even though the people will face hardening of heart and judgment, "the holy seed will be its stump," indicating that a remnant will survive and continue the line of God's faithful.

3. **Amos’s Acknowledgment of a Remnant**:
   - In the Book of Amos, particularly in Amos 5:15, there is an exhortation to "Hate evil, and love good," which emphasizes the idea that a remnant of faithful people will exist amid the nation’s corruption. Amos calls for justice and righteousness, suggesting that those who adhere to these values will form a faithful remnant.

4. **Restoration Promised for the Remnant**:
   - Isaiah 10:20-22 mentions that "in that day the remnant of Israel... will no longer rely on him who struck them down but will truly rely on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel." This implies a future hope where the remnant will be restored and embraced by God, emphasizing their significance in the larger narrative of salvation and judgment.

5. **Relationship Between Judgment and Preservation**:
   - Both prophets illustrate that judgment is not the end; rather, for Isaiah and Amos, it serves as a purification process. For example, in Amos 9:8-9, the Lord expresses that He will not completely destroy Israel, signaling that some will be preserved and ultimately restored.

These events and themes together serve to highlight that throughout biblical history, despite the evidence of widespread unfaithfulness and sin, God maintains a remnant—those who remain faithful to His covenant and will carry forward the promise of redemption. The remnant symbolizes hope and continuity of faith in God's grace even against the backdrop of judgment.
