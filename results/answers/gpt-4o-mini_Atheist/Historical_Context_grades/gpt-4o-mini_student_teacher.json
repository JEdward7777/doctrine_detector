  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the concept of the remnant as seen in Isaiah and Amos, citing relevant biblical passages and events. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the theme of the remnant in relation to God's promises. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly linking the events and passages mentioned to the historical significance of the remnant in connection to God's promises, as specified in the concern."
