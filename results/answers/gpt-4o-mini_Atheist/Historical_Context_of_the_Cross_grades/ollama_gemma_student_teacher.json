  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thorough response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the historical and theological significance of the cross in early Christianity. The student clearly articulates the initial negative connotations associated with crucifixion, followed by the transformative interpretation of the cross as a symbol of redemption and hope. The inclusion of references to Paul's writings and the development of artistic representations further strengthens the response."
