  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and sensitive approach to introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit in a culturally diverse context. It effectively focuses on universal themes and experiences that resonate across belief systems, while providing relatable examples and narratives. The emphasis on personal experience and respect for cultural beliefs aligns well with the concern expressed about clear and contextual teaching. However, the response would benefit from a stronger connection to the Trinitarian nature of the Holy Spirit and a more explicit explanation of His role in the believer's life."
