  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer an 80. \n\nThe student has provided a thorough and well-supported explanation of the significance of having no hope according to biblical references. They have accurately referenced specific Bible verses and have connected them effectively to themes of despair, separation from God, and the potential for redemption. However, the student could improve by directly addressing the concern raised in the reference answer, which focuses on the stark certainty of having no expectation of good contrary to God's promises. Integrating this perspective more explicitly would strengthen the overall response. "
