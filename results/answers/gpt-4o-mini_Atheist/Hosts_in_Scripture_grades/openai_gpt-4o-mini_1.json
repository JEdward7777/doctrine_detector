It correctly addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority can impact a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively connects the concept of \"hosts\" to spiritual warfare and prayer. Great job!"
