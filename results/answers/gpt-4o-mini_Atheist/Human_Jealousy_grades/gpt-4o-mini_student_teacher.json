They covered various practical steps and suggestions for handling jealousy effectively. However, the response could have been more explicitly tied to the Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of love, selflessness, and trust in relationships, as guided by biblical principles. Additionally, focusing more on seeking God's guidance and relying on faith to overcome jealousy would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
