## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In Christian theology, particularly within Protestant traditions, a person is declared righteous primarily through the doctrine of justification by faith. This concept is rooted in several key beliefs:

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: Central to the Christian understanding of righteousness is the belief that faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior is essential. According to Romans 3:22-24, righteousness comes through faith in Jesus for all who believe.

2. **Grace of God**: Righteousness is viewed as a gift from God, not something that can be earned through human efforts. Ephesians 2:8-9 emphasizes that salvation and righteousness are by grace through faith, not by works.

3. **The Atonement**: Christians believe that Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection provided atonement for sin. This act reconciles believers to God, making them righteous in His sight (Romans 5:1). 

4. **Imputed Righteousness**: Many Christian traditions teach that when a person places their faith in Christ, the righteousness of Christ is imputed to them. This means that God considers the believer as righteous because of Christ’s righteousness, rather than their own actions.

5. **Transformation of Life**: While righteousness is initially a legal declaration, many Christians believe it should lead to a transformed life. This transformation is facilitated by the Holy Spirit, leading believers to live in accordance with God’s will, which reflects their righteous standing.

In summary, within the Christian faith, a person is declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ, God’s grace, the atonement provided by Christ, the imputed righteousness from Christ, and the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in their lives.
