  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns closely with the Christian belief in justification by faith. The response effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the basis for human righteousness in relation to faith in Jesus. The inclusion of key scriptural references and theological concepts enriches the explanation, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview. However, the reference answer from the teacher offers a succinct and direct response which could be considered more concise and focused, hence the slight deduction in points. Overall, the student's answer is thorough and reflective of a sound understanding of Christian beliefs regarding righteousness."
