  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus. It correctly emphasizes that a person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus, and that God attributes Jesus' righteousness to them. The response also touches on the idea that this declaration is based on God's grace and cleansing from sin.\n\nHowever, the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation of the doctrine of justification by faith. For example, it does not explicitly mention the concept of imputed righteousness, which is an important part of many Christian traditions' understanding of how a person can be declared righteous. Additionally, while the response mentions that \"God cleanses them from their sins,\" it could provide more specific biblical support for this idea.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding salvation and human righteousness in relation to faith in Jesus, but could benefit from further development and clarification of key theological concepts."
