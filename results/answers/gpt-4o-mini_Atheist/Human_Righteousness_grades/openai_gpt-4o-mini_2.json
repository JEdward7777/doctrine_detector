  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively articulates the essential concept that a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus, with an emphasis on God's cleansing from sin and the attribution of Jesus' righteousness. It aligns well with the Christian understanding of salvation through faith in Christ. However, the response could be strengthened by incorporating more explicit references to key Christian doctrines such as justification by faith, grace, atonement, and the transformative work of the Holy Spirit, as these concepts provide a deeper theological framework for understanding the basis of human righteousness. Overall, a solid explanation with room for deeper theological exploration."
