  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of practical steps to align actions with beliefs, which is commendable. However, the student's answer lacks a strong emphasis on seeking God's guidance through prayer and living according to His Word, which are crucial aspects of ensuring alignment with Christian beliefs and values. Encouraging the student to incorporate more explicit references to God and Scripture would enhance the Christian worldview perspective in their response."
