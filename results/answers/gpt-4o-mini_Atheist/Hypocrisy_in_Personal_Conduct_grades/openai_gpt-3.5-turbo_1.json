The emphasis on seeking God's guidance through prayer and living authentically according to His Word aligns well with Christian values. The only slight improvement could be explicitly mentioning the importance of seeking forgiveness from God when inconsistencies between beliefs and actions occur, as this is a crucial aspect of addressing hypocrisy from a Christian worldview."
