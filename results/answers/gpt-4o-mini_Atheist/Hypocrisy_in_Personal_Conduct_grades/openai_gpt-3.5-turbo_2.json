However, the focus on seeking God's guidance through prayer and living authentically according to His Word could have been emphasized more throughout the suggestions to explicitly tie them back to the Christian worldview. Integrating more references to biblical principles and aligning the steps with scriptural teachings would have strengthened the response further. Nonetheless, the overall guidance provided aligns well with Christian values and principles."
