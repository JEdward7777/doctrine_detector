  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the phrase \"I have called you by name\" from various perspectives, including personal relationship, identity, divine assurance, call to action, and cultural context. The explanation is well-structured, demonstrating a good understanding of the theological implications behind the phrase in Christianity. The integration of scholarly insights adds depth to the interpretation. However, to enhance the grade, the response could further emphasize the foundational biblical context of this phrase and the significance of God's personal call in the life of believers."
