  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. \n\nThe student's response provides a comprehensive analysis of the phrase \"I have called you by name\" from various perspectives, including personal relationship, identity and value, divine assurance, call to action, and cultural context. The student effectively connects these points to understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly tying these points back to the Christian worldview, emphasizing the special relationship believers have with God and their value as His children. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the concept but could have made the connection to Christian beliefs more explicit."
