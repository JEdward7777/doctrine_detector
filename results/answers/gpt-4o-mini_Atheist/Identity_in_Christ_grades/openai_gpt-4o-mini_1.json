  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the phrase \"I have called you by name\" from both a personal and scholarly perspective, highlighting the deep significance of being known and valued by God. It effectively addresses the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ by emphasizing the personal relationship and affirmation of identity conveyed in the phrase. The incorporation of cultural context adds depth to the analysis. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the analysis back to the specific concern throughout the response for even stronger alignment."
