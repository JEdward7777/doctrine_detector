It expands upon the original answer by delving into the multifaceted aspects of Jesus's purpose, such as His messianic role, teachings, example of humanity, and universal significance. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the interconnected layers of Jesus's purpose in relation to salvation and ethical teachings. However, there is room for improvement in linking these aspects more explicitly to the Christian worldview, such as emphasizing Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies."
