However, it lacks depth in explaining the foundational belief in Jesus' atoning sacrifice on the cross as the primary means of inheriting eternal life. Additionally, the answer could have included references to verses like Romans 6:23 and Ephesians 2:8-9 to further support the discussion on salvation through grace and faith in Christ. Enhancing these aspects would strengthen the doctrinal correctness of the response."
