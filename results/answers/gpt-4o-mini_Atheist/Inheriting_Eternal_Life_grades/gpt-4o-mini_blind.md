In the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the concept of inheriting eternal life is discussed in several passages. One notable instance is found in the Gospels, where a rich young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. In response, Jesus emphasizes the importance of following the commandments and living a life of love and selflessness. 

In the Gospel of Mark (10:17-27), Jesus tells the young man to sell all he has, give to the poor, and then follow Him, indicating that true discipleship involves sacrifice and commitment to serving others. Similarly, in the Gospel of John (3:16), it is stated that believing in Jesus is essential for eternal life, highlighting faith as a crucial element.

Overall, the biblical perspective on inheriting eternal life involves a combination of faith, following God's commandments, selflessness, and a relationship with Jesus. Different Christian denominations may interpret these passages in varied ways, leading to diverse understandings of what it means to inherit eternal life.

Grade: 70

Comment: The answer provides a generally accurate overview of the biblical teachings on inheriting eternal life, mentioning key concepts such as faith, following commandments, selflessness, and relationship with Jesus. However, it lacks depth in explaining the foundational belief in Jesus' atoning sacrifice on the cross as the primary means of inheriting eternal life. Additionally, the answer could have included references to verses like Romans 6:23 and Ephesians 2:8-9 to further support the discussion on salvation through grace and faith in Christ. Enhancing these aspects would strengthen the doctrinal correctness of the response.
