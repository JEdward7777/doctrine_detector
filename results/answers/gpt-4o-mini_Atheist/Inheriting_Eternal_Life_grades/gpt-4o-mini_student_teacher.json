  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive overview of the biblical perspective on inheriting eternal life, including references to key passages such as the interaction with the rich young ruler and the verse from the Gospel of John. However, the student's answer lacks focus on the specific teachings of Jesus as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. To improve the grade, the response could have centered more on Jesus' direct teachings and instructions on how to inherit eternal life, as seen in the interaction with the expert in Jewish law."
