  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical perspective on inheriting eternal life, referencing relevant passages from the Gospels and highlighting the importance of faith and following God's commandments. The inclusion of varying interpretations among Christian denominations adds nuance and acknowledges the diversity of beliefs. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit statement connecting the concept of following Jesus' teachings to the overall theme of salvation and eternal life."
