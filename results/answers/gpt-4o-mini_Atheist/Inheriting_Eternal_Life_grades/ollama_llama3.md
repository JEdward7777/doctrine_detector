In the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the concept of inheriting eternal life is discussed in several passages. One notable instance is found in the Gospels, where a rich young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. In response, Jesus emphasizes the importance of following the commandments and living a life of love and selflessness. 

In the Gospel of Mark (10:17-27), Jesus tells the young man to sell all he has, give to the poor, and then follow Him, indicating that true discipleship involves sacrifice and commitment to serving others. Similarly, in the Gospel of John (3:16), it is stated that believing in Jesus is essential for eternal life, highlighting faith as a crucial element.

The response does a good job of discussing the biblical perspective on inheriting eternal life, highlighting key passages such as Mark 10:17-27 and John 3:16. The writer also correctly emphasizes the importance of faith, following God's commandments, selflessness, and a relationship with Jesus.

However, the response could be improved by more directly addressing the concern about clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. While the writer mentions the rich young ruler's question and Jesus' emphasis on following His teachings, the response could benefit from a more explicit explanation of how these teachings relate to the concept of inheriting eternal life.

Additionally, while the response touches on the idea that different Christian denominations may have varying interpretations of this topic, it could delve deeper into exploring these differences and how they might impact our understanding of salvation and eternal life.

Overall, the response is strong in its biblical foundation and clear explanation of the concepts involved. With a bit more attention to directly addressing the concern and exploring the nuances of different Christian denominations' views on salvation and eternal life, it could be even more effective in clarifying the path to these essential Christian concepts.
