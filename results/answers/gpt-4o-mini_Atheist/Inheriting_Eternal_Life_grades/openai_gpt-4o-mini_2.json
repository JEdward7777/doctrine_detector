The mention of the interaction with the expert in Jewish law further reinforces the importance of following Jesus's teachings. However, a more explicit reference to Jesus's statement on selling all possessions and giving to the poor as a path to inheriting eternal life could have enhanced the explanation further. Overall, a good understanding of the concept but could have been strengthened with additional specific biblical references."
