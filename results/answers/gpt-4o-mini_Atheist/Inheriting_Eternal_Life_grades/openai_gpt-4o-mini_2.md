In the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the concept of inheriting eternal life is discussed in several passages. One notable instance is found in the Gospels, where a rich young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. In response, Jesus emphasizes the importance of following the commandments and living a life of love and selflessness. 

In the Gospel of Mark (10:17-27), Jesus tells the young man to sell all he has, give to the poor, and then follow Him, indicating that true discipleship involves sacrifice and commitment to serving others. Similarly, in the Gospel of John (3:16), it is stated that believing in Jesus is essential for eternal life, highlighting faith as a crucial element.

Overall, the biblical perspective on inheriting eternal life involves a combination of faith, following God's commandments, selflessness, and a relationship with Jesus. Different Christian denominations may interpret these passages in varied ways, leading to diverse understandings of what it means to inherit eternal life.

Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of the biblical perspective on inheriting eternal life by emphasizing the importance of following Jesus's teachings, including faith, obedience to God's commandments, selflessness, and a relationship with Him. The mention of the interaction with the expert in Jewish law further reinforces the importance of following Jesus's teachings. However, a more explicit reference to Jesus's statement on selling all possessions and giving to the poor as a path to inheriting eternal life could have enhanced the explanation further. Overall, a good understanding of the concept but could have been strengthened with additional specific biblical references.
