  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a comprehensive overview of various examples of injustice in today's world and offers a well-rounded perspective on how Christians should respond. The student appropriately highlights the importance of advocacy, acts of service, promoting kindness, education, interfaith collaboration, and prayer in addressing injustices. However, to improve, the student could strengthen the doctrinal basis for the Christian response by incorporating more specific references to biblical teachings and principles that guide Christians in confronting injustice. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of addressing sin as the root cause of injustice could further enhance the response from a Christian worldview."
