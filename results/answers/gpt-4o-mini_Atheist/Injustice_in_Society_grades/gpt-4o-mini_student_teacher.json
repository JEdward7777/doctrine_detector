  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of examples of injustice in today's world and offered a variety of ways in which Christians can respond to these injustices. The student effectively incorporated biblical principles such as advocacy for the oppressed, acts of service, promoting kindness and solidarity, education and awareness, interfaith collaboration, and prayer. The response aligns well with the concern provided, emphasizing the need for Christian activism against injustice. However, the student's answer could have been improved by providing more specific biblical references to support their points and tying each example of injustice directly to relevant biblical principles."
