The theological implications and contemporary applications are well-articulated, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. However, to enhance the response further, the student could delve deeper into the theological significance of innocent blood in relation to concepts such as sin, atonement, and redemption within the Christian worldview. Overall, a commendable effort with room for further theological exploration."
