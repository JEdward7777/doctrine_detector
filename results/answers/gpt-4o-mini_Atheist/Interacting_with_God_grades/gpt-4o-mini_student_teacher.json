  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response, while well-written and thoughtful, falls short of addressing the concern from a Christian perspective. The answer provided focuses solely on a non-theistic interpretation of the concept of God's will, neglecting the core Christian belief in God\u2019s sovereignty and the impact of our responses on His divine plans for our lives. The student's answer lacks the crucial Christian worldview of acknowledging God as the ultimate authority and source of guidance in shaping our paths. A higher grade would require incorporating key Christian principles such as obedience, faith, and submission to God's will as core components of how our responses can impact His plans for our lives."
