However, the answer lacks a foundational understanding of divine glory within a Christian worldview. It fails to acknowledge the biblical teachings on divine glory, such as God's holiness, majesty, and transcendence. From a Christian perspective, divine glory is not merely a cultural construct but a reflection of God's inherent attributes. The response could have been greatly strengthened by integrating Christian theology and Scripture to provide a more doctrinally sound analysis of the topic."
