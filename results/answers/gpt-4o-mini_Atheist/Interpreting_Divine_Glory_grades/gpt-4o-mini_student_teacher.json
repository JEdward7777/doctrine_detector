  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60. \n\nWhile the student's response provides insightful perspectives on the concept of divine glory in worship from various angles such as symbolism, psychology, culture, morality, rituals, and philosophy, they miss the fundamental Christian perspective on 'divine glory.' The answer lacks a direct connection to God's presence and radiance that is central to understanding divine glory in a Christian context. Additionally, by primarily focusing on atheistic viewpoints and societal constructs, the response deviates from the concern's emphasis on recognizing God's glory in worship practices. The student could improve their grade by incorporating more specific references to biblical teachings on divine glory and the significance of God's presence in worship according to Christian beliefs."
