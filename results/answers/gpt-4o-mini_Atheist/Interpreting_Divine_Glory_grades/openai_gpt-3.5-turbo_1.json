While these insights contribute to a broader understanding of how different individuals and societies may perceive divine glory, it does not directly address the central concern of recognizing and honoring God's glory in worship practices from a Christian worldview. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more specifically Christian perspectives on how divine glory influences worship and reverence towards God."
