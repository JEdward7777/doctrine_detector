  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive exploration of the concept of divine glory from various perspectives, offering insightful analysis of its symbolic, psychological, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. However, the response fails to adequately emphasize the Christian worldview perspective on divine glory, as defined in the given answer. While the additional insights are valuable, they do not sufficiently address the concern of recognizing God's glory in worship practices from a Christian perspective. The response could benefit from more explicit integration of Christian theological principles and teachings related to divine glory."
