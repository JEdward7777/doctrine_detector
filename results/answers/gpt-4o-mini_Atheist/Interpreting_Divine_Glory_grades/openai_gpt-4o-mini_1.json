However, it fails to align with the Christian-specific worldview presented in the initial answer, which defines divine glory as the magnificent and radiant nature of God deserving of adoration and worship. From the Christian perspective, divine glory is not just a cultural construct or psychological experience but a fundamental aspect of God's nature that demands reverence and awe. The response does not sufficiently emphasize the importance of recognizing God's glory in worship practices as influencing how Christians express reverence and awe towards Him."
