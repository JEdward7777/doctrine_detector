  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the term \"Most High\" in relation to God's nature, considering various theological and cultural perspectives. The answer effectively highlights the concepts of supremacy, transcendence, cultural variations, moral authority, and relational aspects associated with this title. However, the response could benefit from a clearer alignment with a Christian-specific worldview, emphasizing foundational Christian doctrines such as the Triune nature of God, biblical revelation, and the deity of Christ. Including these aspects would have further strengthened the theological depth and doctrinal correctness of the answer."
