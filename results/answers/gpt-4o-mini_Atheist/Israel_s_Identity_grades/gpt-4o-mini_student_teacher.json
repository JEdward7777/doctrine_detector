  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of the name 'Israel' in its biblical origin, demonstrating a good understanding of the meaning derived from the Hebrew root and the story of Jacob's renaming. The student effectively connected the biblical context of the name to broader cultural and historical implications. However, the answer could have been improved by directly quoting the reference answer provided by the teacher to align more closely with a Christian-specific worldview."
