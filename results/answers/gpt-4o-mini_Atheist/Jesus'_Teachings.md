## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Gospels, Jesus frequently used the term "amen" to emphasize the authority and truthfulness of His teachings. The word "amen" comes from the Hebrew word meaning "to be firm" or "to be trustworthy." When Jesus used it, especially in the phrase "Truly, I say to you" (often translated from the Aramaic "Amen, amen, I say to you"), it served several purposes in His discourse.

1. **Affirmation of Truth**: By starting His statements with "amen," Jesus was affirming the truth of what He was about to say. It signified that His words carried weight and should be taken seriously.

2. **Authority**: Unlike other teachers of His time, who often quoted established authorities or scriptures to validate their teachings, Jesus spoke with His own authority. The repetition of "amen" positioned Him as a distinct and authoritative voice in religious teaching.

3. **Urgency and Importance**: The repetition of "amen" (as in "Amen, amen") communicates a sense of urgency and importance, indicating that the following statement is of particular significance. This technique would capture the attention of His listeners and underline the critical nature of the message.

4. **Invitation to Respond**: In some contexts, Jesus' use of "amen" invites His listeners to reflect on their own beliefs and the implications of His teachings, prompting a responseâ€”whether through faith, action, or deeper understanding.

Overall, the use of "amen" by Jesus functioned to underscore the veracity, authority, and critical nature of His messages, helping to establish His role as a pivotal figure in religious teaching.
