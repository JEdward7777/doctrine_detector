  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 90.\n\nThe student demonstrated a strong understanding of the key themes in Christian theology related to Jesus' statement, \"I am the Resurrection and the Life.\" They addressed important points such as Jesus' authority over death, the promise of eternal life, spiritual vitality, comfort in times of mourning, and the significance of faith in Jesus. The student's explanation was clear, thorough, and aligned well with Christian beliefs surrounding this topic.\n\nHowever, the student could have further emphasized the unique significance of Jesus as the source of resurrection and life, tying it more explicitly to his divine nature and role as the Son of God. Expanding on this aspect would have further deepened their theological understanding in the Christian worldview."
