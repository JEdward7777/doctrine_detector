  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of Jesus' use of the term \"amen\" in the Gospels, highlighting its role in emphasizing truth, authority, urgency, and invitation to respond. The four points made about Jesus' use of \"amen\" are insightful and demonstrate a good understanding of the biblical context.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger in terms of specifically addressing the concern about recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. While it mentions Jesus' authority as a teacher, it does not explicitly explore how his use of \"amen\" reflects or supports this authority.\n\nOverall, the response is well-organized, clear, and demonstrates a good understanding of biblical language and context. With a bit more attention to addressing the specific concern about recognizing Jesus' authority, the grade could be even higher."
