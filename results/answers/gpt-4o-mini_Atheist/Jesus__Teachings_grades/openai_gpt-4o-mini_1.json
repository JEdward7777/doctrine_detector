It effectively connects Jesus' use of \"amen\" to the recognition of His authority in Scripture, demonstrating a deep understanding of how Jesus' words are viewed within a Christian worldview. The response could be further strengthened by providing specific examples of Jesus using \"amen\" in Scripture to support the analysis."
