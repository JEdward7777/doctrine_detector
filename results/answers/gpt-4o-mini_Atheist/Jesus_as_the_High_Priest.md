## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, particularly in the book of Hebrews, Jesus is described as a high priest in a unique and transformative way. Hebrews emphasizes that Jesus serves as a high priest, but His priesthood is distinct from the Levitical priesthood of the Old Testament.

1. **Priest in the Order of Melchizedek**: Hebrews 5:6 and 7:17 reference Psalm 110:4, stating that Jesus is a high priest "after the order of Melchizedek." This indicates a priesthood that is eternal and not bound by the lineage and laws of the Levitical priesthood, which was based on descent from Aaron.

2. **Mediator**: Jesus is described as the mediator of a new covenant (Hebrews 9:15). This new covenant is characterized by a direct relationship between God and humanity, facilitated by Jesusâ€™ sacrificial role. 

3. **Perfect High Priest**: In Hebrews 7:26-27, Jesus is portrayed as a perfect high priest who does not need to offer sacrifices for His own sins (as the earthly priests did) because He is sinless. Instead, He offers Himself as the ultimate and final sacrifice for the sins of humanity.

4. **Access to God**: The New Testament also emphasizes that through Jesus, believers have direct access to God (Hebrews 10:19-22). This access contrasts with the Old Testament practices where only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and only once a year.

5. **Compassionate Priest**: Hebrews 4:15 describes Jesus as a high priest who can empathize with human weaknesses, having been tempted in every way, yet without sin. This highlights His ability to relate to human experiences, making Him a compassionate advocate.

In summary, in the New Testament, Jesus is depicted as a transformative high priest whose role transcends the traditional functions of the Levitical priesthood, offering a new covenant and accessible relationship with God for all believers.
