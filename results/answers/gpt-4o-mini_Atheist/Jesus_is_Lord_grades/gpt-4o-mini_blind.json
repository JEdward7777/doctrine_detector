  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out and respectful response on how to communicate the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also referred to as \"lord.\" The answer includes important considerations such as providing contextual explanation, cultural sensitivity, use of analogies, interfaith dialogue, and language variance. The response could further benefit from emphasizing the unique divinity and lordship of Jesus over any earthly authority, highlighting the distinctiveness of the Christian understanding of \"Lord.\" Overall, a solid effort with room for additional theological depth."
