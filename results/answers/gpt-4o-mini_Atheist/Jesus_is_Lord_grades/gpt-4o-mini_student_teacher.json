  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and well-articulated response that addresses the concern of differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. They have offered practical suggestions for communicating the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" effectively in a context where political leaders are also called \"lord.\" The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides relevant insights. However, the grade is slightly lower than perfect as the student could have directly referenced the teacher's concise answer to align more closely with a Christian-specific worldview."
