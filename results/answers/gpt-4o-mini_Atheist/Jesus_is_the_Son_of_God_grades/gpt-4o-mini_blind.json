The student appropriately highlights the differences in theology between Christianity and Islam while offering a culturally sensitive alternative expression. However, the student could strengthen the response by also mentioning that Jesus holds a central role in Islamic eschatology and will return as a key figure in the end times. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of Jesus in a Muslim context."
