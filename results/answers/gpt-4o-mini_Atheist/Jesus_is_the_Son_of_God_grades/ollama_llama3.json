Instead, it replaces the term \"Son of God\" with a more neutral description that may not fully convey the biblical concept.\n\nTo improve, the response could have provided additional explanation or clarification on why Jesus is considered the Son of God in Christian theology, while also acknowledging Islamic beliefs about his role as a prophet and messenger. This would allow for a more nuanced and accurate translation that addresses both concerns. As it stands, the response prioritizes cultural sensitivity over biblical accuracy, which may not fully meet the concern."
