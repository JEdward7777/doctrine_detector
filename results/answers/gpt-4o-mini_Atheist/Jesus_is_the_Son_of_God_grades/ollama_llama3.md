## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

Translating the phrase "Jesus is the Son of God" into a Muslim context requires an understanding of Islamic beliefs about Jesus, known as Isa in Arabic. In Islam, Jesus is respected as a prophet and messenger of God, but the concept of him being the "Son of God" is not accepted. Instead, Muslims believe in the absolute oneness of God (Tawhid) and that God does not have any children or partners.

A culturally respectful way to express the essence of Jesus' role in Islam might be: "Jesus is a revered prophet and messenger of God." This maintains the significance of Jesus within Islamic belief while aligning with fundamental Islamic principles regarding Godâ€™s nature.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic beliefs about Jesus and attempts to provide a culturally respectful translation of the phrase "Jesus is the Son of God." However, it does not directly address the concern of maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning. Instead, it replaces the term "Son of God" with a more neutral description that may not fully convey the biblical concept.

To improve, the response could have provided additional explanation or clarification on why Jesus is considered the Son of God in Christian theology, while also acknowledging Islamic beliefs about his role as a prophet and messenger. This would allow for a more nuanced and accurate translation that addresses both concerns. As it stands, the response prioritizes cultural sensitivity over biblical accuracy, which may not fully meet the concern.
