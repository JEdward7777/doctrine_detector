However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it falls short in accurately conveying the Biblical understanding of Jesus as the Son of God. It is important to emphasize the divinity of Jesus in Christian belief, which is a central tenet of the faith. The suggested translation in the response may not fully capture this crucial aspect of Christian theology."
