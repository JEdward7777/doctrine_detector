  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response correctly emphasizes the importance of maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain the meaning of \"Jesus is the Son of God.\" However, the concern raised is that the provided response does not sufficiently address the need for Biblical accuracy in translation, especially from a Christian worldview. The proposed translation for a Muslim context, while culturally respectful, may not accurately convey the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God. A stronger emphasis on upholding Biblical accuracy would improve the overall grade."
