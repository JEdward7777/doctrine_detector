It is grounded in Christian theology and references biblical passages to support the discussion of faith, works, the final judgment, mercy, grace, and the judgment of believers and non-believers. The incorporation of key elements from the biblical perspective provides a comprehensive understanding of the Day of Judgment within a Christian worldview."
