## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Jesus addresses the issue of pointing out the faults of others in several passages, most notably in the Sermon on the Mount. One of the key teachings is found in Matthew 7:1-5, where he states, "Do not judge, or you too will be judged." He emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and humility by using the metaphor of a speck in someone else's eye versus a plank in one's own eye. This teaching encourages individuals to examine their own faults before criticizing others.

The underlying message is that self-awareness and humility are crucial when addressing the shortcomings of others. Instead of focusing on the flaws of others, Jesus advocates for introspection and personal accountability. This approach promotes compassion and understanding rather than judgment and condemnation.

In a culturally retributive context, this teaching encourages a shift away from punitive attitudes towards others and emphasizes a more empathetic and constructive response to faults and failures. It fosters a community in which individuals support each other in growth and improvement rather than engaging in blame or harsh criticism.
