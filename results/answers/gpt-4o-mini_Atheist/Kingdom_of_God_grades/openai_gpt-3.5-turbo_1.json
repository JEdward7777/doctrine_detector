However, it suggests alternative phrases that still convey the core message of divine sovereignty, community, and spiritual realm. While the suggested alternatives are helpful in making the concept more accessible to different cultures, the response could have emphasized the importance of preserving the biblical significance and suggested providing additional explanations alongside any rephrasing."
