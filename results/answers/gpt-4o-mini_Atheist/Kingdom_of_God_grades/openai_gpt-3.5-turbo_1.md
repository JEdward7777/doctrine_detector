# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Yes, it can be advisable to rephrase "Kingdom of God" in translations for cultures that lack a concept of kingdoms. The term often carries specific cultural and historical connotations that may not resonate with all audiences. To communicate the intended meaning effectively, one might consider using alternative phrases that convey the same themes of divine sovereignty, community, or spiritual realm. 

For instance, terms like "Reign of God," "Divine Community," or "God's Presence" might be more relatable and culturally appropriate, depending on the specific context and beliefs of the audience. The goal should be to maintain the core message while ensuring it is accessible and meaningful to those receiving it. Engaging with local scholars, cultural leaders, or community members can also provide valuable insights into suitable terminology.

Comment: The response acknowledges the concern that rephrasing "Kingdom of God" could potentially lose the depth and biblical context of the term. However, it suggests alternative phrases that still convey the core message of divine sovereignty, community, and spiritual realm. While the suggested alternatives are helpful in making the concept more accessible to different cultures, the response could have emphasized the importance of preserving the biblical significance and suggested providing additional explanations alongside any rephrasing.
