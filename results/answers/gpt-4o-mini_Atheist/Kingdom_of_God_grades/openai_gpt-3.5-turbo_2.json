However, it does not directly address the concern that rephrasing could potentially lose the depth and biblical context of the term. While the suggestions are relevant, there is a lack of acknowledgment or mitigation of the risk regarding the potential loss of the term's specific theological significance. Integrating a reassurance or strategy to maintain the depth and biblical context while rephrasing would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
