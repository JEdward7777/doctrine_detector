While it acknowledged the concern about potentially losing some depth and biblical context by doing so, it offered alternative phrases that still capture the core meaning. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of retaining the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term alongside providing explanations, to ensure that the richness of the biblical context is not completely lost in translation."
