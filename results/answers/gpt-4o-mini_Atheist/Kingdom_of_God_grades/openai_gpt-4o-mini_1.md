## [Answer](../Kingdom_of_God.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Yes, it can be advisable to rephrase "Kingdom of God" in translations for cultures that lack a concept of kingdoms. The term often carries specific cultural and historical connotations that may not resonate with all audiences. To communicate the intended meaning effectively, one might consider using alternative phrases that convey the same themes of divine sovereignty, community, or spiritual realm. 

For instance, terms like "Reign of God," "Divine Community," or "God's Presence" might be more relatable and culturally appropriate, depending on the specific context and beliefs of the audience. The goal should be to maintain the core message while ensuring it is accessible and meaningful to those receiving it. Engaging with local scholars, cultural leaders, or community members can also provide valuable insights into suitable terminology.

Comment: The response provided a well-reasoned argument for rephrasing "Kingdom of God" in translations for cultures that lack the concept of kingdoms. While it acknowledged the concern about potentially losing some depth and biblical context by doing so, it offered alternative phrases that still capture the core meaning. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of retaining the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term alongside providing explanations, to ensure that the richness of the biblical context is not completely lost in translation.
