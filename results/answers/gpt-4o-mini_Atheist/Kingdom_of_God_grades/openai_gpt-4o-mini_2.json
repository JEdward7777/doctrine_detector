However, the concern regarding potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' is not directly addressed. While cultural adaptation is important, the response could have emphasized the significance of retaining the theological richness and biblical foundations of the term in any rephrasing efforts. Additional insights into how to balance cultural relevance with maintaining the original biblical context would have strengthened the response."
