## [Answer](../Kingdom_of_God.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Yes, it can be advisable to rephrase "Kingdom of God" in translations for cultures that lack a concept of kingdoms. The term often carries specific cultural and historical connotations that may not resonate with all audiences. To communicate the intended meaning effectively, one might consider using alternative phrases that convey the same themes of divine sovereignty, community, or spiritual realm. 

For instance, terms like "Reign of God," "Divine Community," or "God's Presence" might be more relatable and culturally appropriate, depending on the specific context and beliefs of the audience. The goal should be to maintain the core message while ensuring it is accessible and meaningful to those receiving it. Engaging with local scholars, cultural leaders, or community members can also provide valuable insights into suitable terminology.

However, the concern regarding potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' is not directly addressed. While cultural adaptation is important, the response could have emphasized the significance of retaining the theological richness and biblical foundations of the term in any rephrasing efforts. Additional insights into how to balance cultural relevance with maintaining the original biblical context would have strengthened the response.
