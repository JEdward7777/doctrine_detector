  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural and theological significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the Book of Matthew. The student effectively explains the cultural context, theological implications, differentiation from earthly kingdoms, eschatological significance, and narrative richness associated with this phrase. The explanation is clear, coherent, and reflects a Christian worldview perspective. However, there could be a deeper exploration of the scriptural references and theological nuances related to the term \"heaven\" in the context of Matthew's Gospel to enhance the depth and precision of the response."
