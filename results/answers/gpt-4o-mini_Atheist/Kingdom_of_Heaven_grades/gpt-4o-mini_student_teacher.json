  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough analysis of the importance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the Book of Matthew, considering cultural and theological contexts. The response effectively discusses the significance of the term within Jewish tradition, theological implications of divine authority and transcendence, differentiation from earthly kingdoms, eschatological hope, and the narrative and symbolic richness it adds to the text. The student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, though it could have been more concise in certain parts to improve clarity and focus. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic and provides insightful explanations. Great job!"
