  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's response correctly identifies that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew and acknowledges the presence of Aramaic in certain portions. The student's additional explanation about the cultural and contextual significance of Hebrew in the texts demonstrates a deeper understanding of the importance of language in studying the Scriptures. They have shown a good grasp of the subject matter with a minor inclusion that enhances their answer from a Christian worldview."
