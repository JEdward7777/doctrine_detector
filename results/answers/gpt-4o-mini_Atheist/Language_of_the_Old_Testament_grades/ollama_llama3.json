  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately identifies that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which aligns with the given answer. It also provides additional information about specific books being written in Aramaic, which adds depth to the initial statement. However, the concern stated is that understanding the original context of the Scriptures is essential, and while this response acknowledges the cultural and contextual importance of Hebrew, it could be improved by explicitly highlighting the significance of knowing the language of the texts for interpreting them correctly.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good grasp of the linguistic background of the Old Testament, but could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting the language to its importance for understanding the original context."
