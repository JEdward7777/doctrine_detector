  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 70. \n\nWhile the answer provides a general overview of how believers in a city typically met, it lacks specific references to the biblical or historical practices of early church gatherings. The student does acknowledge the importance of meeting in homes for intimacy and community, but they could enhance their answer by including references to passages in the New Testament where believers are shown gathering in such settings. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to Christian teachings on the importance of fellowship and communal worship. Overall, the answer shows a good understanding of the topic but falls short in providing a deeper exploration of the Christian perspective on communal gatherings."
