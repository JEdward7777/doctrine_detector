  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response articulately and accurately explains the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian tradition. The student effectively highlights the key elements of the Last Supper, such as Jesus' sacrifice, the establishment of the new covenant, and the importance of fellowship and community among believers. The doctrinal correctness is strong, with only minor room for improvement in terms of theological depth."
