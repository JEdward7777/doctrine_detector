  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid understanding of the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith, highlighting key aspects such as Jesus' sacrifice, the establishment of the new covenant, and the importance of fellowship among believers. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the Passover meal aspect of the Last Supper and emphasizing the symbolism of Jesus' body and blood as a sacrifice for sin, in alignment with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
