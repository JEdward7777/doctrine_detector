The Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist, commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with his disciples before his crucifixion. During this meal, Jesus established the rite, sharing bread and wine and instructing his followers to do this in remembrance of him. The event is significant in Christian tradition as it symbolizes Jesus' sacrifice, the new covenant between God and humanity, and serves as a reminder of the principles of fellowship and community among believers.

Comment: The student's answer provides a solid understanding of the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith, highlighting key aspects such as Jesus' sacrifice, the establishment of the new covenant, and the importance of fellowship among believers. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the Passover meal aspect of the Last Supper and emphasizing the symbolism of Jesus' body and blood as a sacrifice for sin, in alignment with the reference answer provided by the teacher.
