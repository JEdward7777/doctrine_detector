  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately describes the significance of the Lord's Supper as a commemoration of Jesus' Last Supper with his disciples. It emphasizes the symbolization of his body and blood as a sacrifice for sin, aligning with the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the response highlights the importance of the meal as a new covenant between God and humanity, and as a reminder of fellowship and community among believers. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the theological significance of the Lord's Supper within Christian tradition."
