  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated response that highlights the sacred and divine nature of the marriage bond from a Christian perspective. They effectively address the significance of unity, love, mutual respect, and selflessness within marriage, while also touching on the broader societal implications. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview concern provided, emphasizing the importance of upholding God's design for relationships. However, there is some slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of focus and conciseness, which is why a slightly lower grade is given."
