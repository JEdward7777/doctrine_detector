  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate response by listing the specific passages where the names of the twelve disciples are mentioned in the New Testament. They demonstrated a good understanding of the topic by referencing multiple books and sections. However, the student could have received a higher grade if they had explicitly mentioned that the names of the disciples are listed in Matthew, Mark, and Luke as per the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview by showcasing knowledge of the Gospel accounts and their teachings."
