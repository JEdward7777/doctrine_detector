## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The names of the twelve disciples (also known as the twelve apostles) are listed in several books of the New Testament. Here are the primary sections where their names appear:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage lists the apostles and gives some context about their calling.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - Similar to Matthew, this passage includes the names of the apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - Here, the disciples are selected and their names are provided.
4. **Acts 1:13** - After the resurrection of Jesus, this book also lists the apostles, reflecting their role in the early church.

These listings include variations in wording, but the core names remain consistent across these texts.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a detailed and accurate response by listing the specific passages where the names of the twelve disciples are mentioned in the New Testament. They demonstrated a good understanding of the topic by referencing multiple books and sections. However, the student could have received a higher grade if they had explicitly mentioned that the names of the disciples are listed in Matthew, Mark, and Luke as per the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview by showcasing knowledge of the Gospel accounts and their teachings.
