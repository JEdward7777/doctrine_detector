  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe student has correctly identified the general location where the names of the twelve disciples can be found, stating that they are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. This shows a basic understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings, as per the concern specified. However, the student could have been more specific about the exact passages or sections where these names appear, which is why I'm deducting some points.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a satisfactory grasp of the topic, but could be improved with more detail and precision."
