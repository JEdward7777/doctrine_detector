## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The names of the twelve disciples (also known as the twelve apostles) are listed in several books of the New Testament. Here are the primary sections where their names appear:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage lists the apostles and gives some context about their calling.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - Similar to Matthew, this passage includes the names of the apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - Here, the disciples are selected and their names are provided.
4. **Acts 1:13** - After the resurrection of Jesus, this book also lists the apostles, reflecting their role in the early church.

These listings include variations in wording, but the core names remain consistent across these texts.

I'd give this response a grade of 80.

The student has correctly identified the general location where the names of the twelve disciples can be found, stating that they are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. This shows a basic understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings, as per the concern specified. However, the student could have been more specific about the exact passages or sections where these names appear, which is why I'm deducting some points.

Overall, the response demonstrates a satisfactory grasp of the topic, but could be improved with more detail and precision.
