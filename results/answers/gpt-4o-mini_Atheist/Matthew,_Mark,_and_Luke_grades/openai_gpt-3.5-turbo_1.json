  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation by mentioning additional relevant passages where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. This demonstrates a good understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings related to the disciples. The only improvement could be to explicitly state that Acts 1:13 also lists the names of the apostles, as this would further enhance the response's completeness."
