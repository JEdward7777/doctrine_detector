# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The names of the twelve disciples (also known as the twelve apostles) are listed in several books of the New Testament. Here are the primary sections where their names appear:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage lists the apostles and gives some context about their calling.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - Similar to Matthew, this passage includes the names of the apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - Here, the disciples are selected and their names are provided.
4. **Acts 1:13** - After the resurrection of Jesus, this book also lists the apostles, reflecting their role in the early church.

These listings include variations in wording, but the core names remain consistent across these texts.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation by mentioning additional relevant passages where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. This demonstrates a good understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings related to the disciples. The only improvement could be to explicitly state that Acts 1:13 also lists the names of the apostles, as this would further enhance the response's completeness.
