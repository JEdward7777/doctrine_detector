## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The names of the twelve disciples (also known as the twelve apostles) are listed in several books of the New Testament. Here are the primary sections where their names appear:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage lists the apostles and gives some context about their calling.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - Similar to Matthew, this passage includes the names of the apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - Here, the disciples are selected and their names are provided.
4. **Acts 1:13** - After the resurrection of Jesus, this book also lists the apostles, reflecting their role in the early church.

These listings include variations in wording, but the core names remain consistent across these texts.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately provides specific references in the New Testament where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. It demonstrates a good understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings, as it aligns with a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is that Acts, not mentioned in the response, also lists the disciples, which would provide a more comprehensive view.
