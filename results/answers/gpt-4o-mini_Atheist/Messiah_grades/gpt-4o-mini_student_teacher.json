  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the term \"Messiah\" in various religious contexts, showcasing a good understanding of the topic. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on Jesus' unique role as the Messiah fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and His significance as the savior. While the student covered different religious expectations of a savior, they could have better highlighted Jesus' distinctiveness and how He aligns with scripture as the ultimate Anointed One."
