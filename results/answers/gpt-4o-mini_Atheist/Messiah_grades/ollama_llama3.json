However, to fully address the concern about differentiating Jesus' role from other religious savior figures while staying true to scripture, it would have been beneficial to include more explicit comparisons and contrasts between Jesus and other messianic figures discussed in the response (e.g., Islamic view of Jesus as a prophet who will return at the end of times). Nevertheless, the response provides a solid foundation for teaching about Jesus' role as savior while acknowledging the diverse understandings of messiah across different faiths."
