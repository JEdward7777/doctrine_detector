  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 85.\n\nThe student demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of the title \"King of the Jews\" in relation to Jesus' identity as the Messiah from both a theological and political perspective. They accurately describe the messianic expectations, the political dimensions, the inversion of power, and the universal significance associated with this title. \n\nHowever, to improve their response, the student could further emphasize the centrality of Jesus' sacrificial death and victorious resurrection in establishing His kingship and fulfilling messianic expectations. Additionally, linking the Old Testament prophecies more explicitly to Jesus' fulfillment of the title \"King of the Jews\" would strengthen their argument. \n\nOverall, this is a well-written and thorough response that demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic."
