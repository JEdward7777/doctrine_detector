  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated answer that explores the significance of the title \"King of the Jews\" in relation to Jesus' identity as the Messiah from various angles - including messianic expectations, political dimensions, inversion of power, and universal significance. The student effectively connects these aspects to Jesus' role as the Messiah within the Christian faith. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly emphasizing the eternal aspect of Jesus' reign as the Messiah, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
