It effectively addresses the concern by delving into various theological, political, and universal dimensions of Jesus' kingship, illustrating how understanding Jesus' messianic role is indeed central to the Christian faith. Adjustments could include a more explicit emphasis on the eternal nature of Jesus' reign as Messiah, as mentioned in the given answer, to further strengthen the connection between Jesus as the promised Messiah and the eternal nature of his kingship within Christian belief."
