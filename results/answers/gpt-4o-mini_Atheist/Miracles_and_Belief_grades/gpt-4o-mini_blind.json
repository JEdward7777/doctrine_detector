The points mentioned are articulated well and offer a solid understanding of the topic. However, one area for improvement could be further emphasizing the foundational Christian belief that miracles ultimately point to the existence and power of the one true God as revealed in the Bible. Incorporating scriptural references or theological underpinnings specific to Christian doctrine would strengthen the response within a Christian worldview."
