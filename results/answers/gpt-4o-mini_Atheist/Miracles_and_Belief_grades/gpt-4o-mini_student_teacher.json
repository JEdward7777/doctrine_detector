  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a comprehensive overview of various ways in which miracles can lead to belief in God, there is a lack of emphasis on the specific Christian perspective and the central role of miracles in validating the ministry of prophets and apostles. The answer could have been improved by focusing more on the biblical accounts of miracles in the Christian tradition and their significance in pointing towards God's power and presence. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references and emphasizing the unique role of miracles in Christian evangelism and personal faith could have enhanced the overall alignment with a Christian worldview."
