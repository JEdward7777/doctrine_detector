The suggestions clearly emphasize the importance of sound biblical teaching on the doctrine of the Trinity while also offering culturally sensitive and respectful approaches to engaging with individuals who may hold misconceptions about Christian beliefs. The only minor point for improvement would have been to possibly include a direct reference to the Bible or Scripture in one of the strategies to underscore the importance of grounding teachings in biblical authority."
