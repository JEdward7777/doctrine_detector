  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth. They effectively discuss both the historical and symbolic significance of myrrh, connecting it to Jesus' future suffering and death. Additionally, they correctly link myrrh's inclusion in the gifts with Jesus' dual nature and mission. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the Christian theological understanding of myrrh within the context of Christ's sacrificial role."
