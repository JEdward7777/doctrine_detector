  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-explained response in line with the Christian belief that Jesus is the image of God. They effectively address the theological concepts associated with this belief, such as Revelation of God, Incarnation, Redemption, Human Dignity, and Transformation. The explanation is thorough and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific biblical references to support the statement that Jesus is God himself and shares the same essence with God the Father."
