The answer effectively communicates the eternal nature of God and the contrasting destinies of the righteous and the unrighteous. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the central Christian belief that eternity is a state of being with no beginning or end, representing eternal life with God or eternal separation from Him."
