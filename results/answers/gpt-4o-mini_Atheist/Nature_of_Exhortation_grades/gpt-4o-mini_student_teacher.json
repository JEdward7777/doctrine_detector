  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student does provide a comprehensive and well-reasoned response on how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament, they do include a lot of additional insights and references, which while valuable, may dilute the simplicity of the core message. The student effectively covers key principles such as encouragement, speaking the truth in love, the role of Scripture, humility, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, timeliness, relevance, and community accountability. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes exhortation in love without unnecessary elaboration, which could be seen as the most essential aspect of the Christian approach to exhortation. Therefore, the student's answer, although thorough, could be enhanced by focusing more on the core message of exhorting in love."
