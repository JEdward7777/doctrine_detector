  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The response provides a solid understanding of Jesus's statement about God being a spirit, emphasizing important theological aspects such as non-corporeality, presence, and true worship. The explanation on how this understanding should influence worship is insightful, stressing internal focus, quality over form, and inclusivity. The connection to the Samaritan woman's encounter with Jesus is well articulated. To enhance the grade, the student could include more explicit references to relevant biblical passages or theological doctrines to further support their points. Additionally, integrating how the Holy Spirit enables believers to worship in spirit and truth could deepen the analysis. Overall, a commendable response with room for further theological elaboration."
