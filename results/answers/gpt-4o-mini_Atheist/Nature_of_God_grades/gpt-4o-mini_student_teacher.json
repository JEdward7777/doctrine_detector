  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the significance of Jesus' statement that \"God is a spirit\" and how it should influence our worship. They effectively highlighted key implications of God's non-physical nature, emphasizing the importance of spiritual engagement in worship. The student's answer demonstrated a strong understanding of the essence of God and provided practical insights on how to appropriately connect with Him in worship from a Christian worldview. One suggestion for improvement could be to directly tie back the student's points to the essence of God and worship even more explicitly."
