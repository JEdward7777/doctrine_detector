It effectively addresses the concern by delving into the non-corporeality of God, the implications for presence and accessibility, and the importance of true worship. The explanation is well-supported with scriptural references and implications for believers, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the essence of God and how to appropriately connect with Him in worship from a Christian worldview."
