  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of the biblical perspectives on hell, covering various terminology, descriptions, the nature of punishment, final judgment, and cultural interpretations. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and incorporates important biblical references. However, there is room for improvement in highlighting the centrality of sin and rebellion against God as the root cause of hell, as well as emphasizing the eternal separation from God as a crucial aspect of the punishment in hell. Overall, it is a well-researched and well-articulated response."
