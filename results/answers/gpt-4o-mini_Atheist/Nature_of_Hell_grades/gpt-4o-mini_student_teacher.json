  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70. \n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive overview of the various biblical references and interpretations of hell, they did not clearly emphasize the severity and purpose of hell as outlined in the reference answer. The student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the eternal nature of suffering in hell for those who reject God and Jesus, aligning more closely with the Christian perspective on judgment and salvation."
