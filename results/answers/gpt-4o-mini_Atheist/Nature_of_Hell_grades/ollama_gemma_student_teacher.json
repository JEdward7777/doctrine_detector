  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical perspectives on the nature and experience of hell. It provides a nuanced analysis of different terms and interpretations, supported by relevant textual references. The inclusion of cultural influences and varying theological viewpoints adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of eternal conscious torment and its theological significance."
