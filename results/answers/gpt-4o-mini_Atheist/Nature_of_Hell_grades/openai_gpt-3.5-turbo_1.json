It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the severity and purpose of hell in the context of Christian view of judgment and salvation. The response could have further emphasized the eternal aspect of hell as a separation from God's presence, as well as the importance of repentance and faith in Jesus Christ for salvation, which are central aspects of the Christian worldview regarding hell."
