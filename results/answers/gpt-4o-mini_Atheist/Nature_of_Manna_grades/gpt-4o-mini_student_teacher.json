  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and accurate description of the appearance and taste of manna according to the Bible. They effectively tie this description to the understanding of the miraculous provision of God for the Israelites. However, the student's answer contains additional details beyond the reference answer, which while informative, slightly deviates from the specific focus on the appearance and taste of manna."
