## [Answer](../Nature_of_Manna.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, manna is described as a miraculous food provided by God to the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness after leaving Egypt. The appearance of manna is depicted as resembling coriander seed, appearing white, and like "bdellium," which is often understood to be a type of resin or gum. 

In terms of taste, manna is described as having a flavor similar to that of honey wafers (Exodus 16:31) and, in another instance, as tasting like cakes baked with oil (Numbers 11:8). This suggests that it had a pleasant, sweet taste that was satisfying and nourishing to the people. The descriptions highlight both the divine origin and the sustenance that manna provided during their time in the desert.
