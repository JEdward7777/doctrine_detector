  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the interpretations of Jesus's miracles within Christian theology, showcasing an understanding of various aspects of His identity. However, there is room for improvement as the focus should have been more explicitly on affirming Jesus's divine nature based on the concern provided. The student did not directly address the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature as specifically needed, which affected the overall alignment with the Christian worldview."
