It effectively addresses the concern by discussing various ways in which the miracles affirm Jesus' divine nature and identity as God and the Messiah. The articulate explanations demonstrate a strong understanding of the importance of Jesus's miracles in confirming His divinity. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the unique and exclusive nature of Jesus as the Son of God and the significance of His miracles in confirming this belief within Christian worldview."
