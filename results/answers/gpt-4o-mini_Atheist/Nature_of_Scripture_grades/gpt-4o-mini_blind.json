The distinction between the two terms is clearly outlined, highlighting how they are interconnected yet represent slightly different concepts. The inclusion of the reference to John 1:1 to illustrate the association of \"the Word of God\" with Jesus Christ is commendable. The explanation is doctrinally sound and demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian perspective on these terms."
