  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-detailed and insightful explanation of the relationship between \"scripture\" and \"the word of God\" in the biblical context. They have accurately distinguished between the two terms and have effectively explained how they are related. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by more direct reference to the specific concern provided, which focused on clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word. Overall, a solid response with a strong understanding of the topic."
