It goes beyond a basic definition by delving into the significance and nuances of these terms. The clarification on how \"the word of God\" can encompass both the written text and divine messages, particularly through Jesus Christ, demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by illustrating the interconnectedness of scripture and God's communication."
