  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provides a well-thought-out analysis of the roles our sinful nature and external influences play in temptation, considering various perspectives and factors. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on the Christian teachings regarding temptation, specifically the aspect of external influences including Satan. A stronger alignment with Christian beliefs and the reference answer would have enhanced the response."
