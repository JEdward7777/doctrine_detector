However, from a Christian worldview, the understanding of temptation as solely arising from our \"sinful nature\" and external influences such as other people and Satan is crucial. While the response touched on some aspects of temptation related to human nature and external influences, it did not emphasize the spiritual aspect of temptation and the role of Satan as a tempter in Christian teaching. In the future, integrating biblical references and highlighting the spiritual battle between good and evil, as well as the need for reliance on God's strength to overcome temptation, would strengthen the response from a Christian perspective."
