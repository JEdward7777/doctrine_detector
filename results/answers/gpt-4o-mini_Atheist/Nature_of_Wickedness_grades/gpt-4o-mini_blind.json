  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive overview of the ways in which the Bible addresses wickedness in individuals, covering key themes ranging from moral transgressions to the importance of repentance and redemption. The integration of relevant biblical references enhances the depth of the analysis. One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the foundational role of sin as the root cause of wickedness in individuals, connecting it to the broader theological context of the Fall and humanity's fallen nature."
