  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive examination of the ways in which the Bible addresses wickedness, covering various aspects such as moral transgressions, social injustice, idolatry, inner intentions, consequences, and redemption. The response effectively connects biblical teachings on wickedness to moral behavior and spiritual growth. However, the grade is slightly lower than perfect as the student could have further emphasized the spiritual growth aspect by highlighting the transformative power of repentance and redemption in personal growth and relationship with God."
