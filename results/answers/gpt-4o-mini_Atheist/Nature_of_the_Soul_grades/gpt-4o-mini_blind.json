  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid overview of the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible, highlighting their distinctiveness and commonalties effectively. The explanation is clear and touches on key aspects of these concepts as understood within a Christian worldview. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the theological underpinnings of these concepts within Christology and the broader biblical narrative. Additionally, more references to specific biblical passages could have enriched the response further. Overall, a well-articulated and informative explanation."
