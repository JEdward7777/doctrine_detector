  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive and well-organized explanation of the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in biblical texts, their answer differs from the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer clearly distinguishes between 'soul' and 'spirit' and emphasizes their respective roles and characteristics. However, the teacher's reference answer suggests that the Bible may present these concepts as either distinct or interchangeable, which was not addressed in the student's response.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' and their implications for human nature and relationship with God."
