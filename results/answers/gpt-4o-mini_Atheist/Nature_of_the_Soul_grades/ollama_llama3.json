  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise overview of the biblical concepts of \"soul\" (nephesh/psyche) and \"spirit\" (ruach/pneuma), highlighting their distinctiveness, interrelation, and functions. While it does not explicitly address the answer's focus on whether they are presented as separate or interchangeable terms, it provides a detailed explanation that supports the concern of understanding biblical definitions for accurate interpretation.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical texts and theological traditions related to these concepts. It also attempts to provide a summary at the end, which is generally clear but could be more concise. The only area where improvement can be made is in directly addressing the answer's prompt, as it does not explicitly state whether the Bible presents \"soul\" and \"spirit\" as separate or interchangeable terms.\n\nOverall, the response provides a strong foundation for understanding the biblical concepts of \"soul\" and \"spirit,\" and with some refinement to address the specific question, it could be even more effective in supporting the concern for accurate interpretation."
