It accurately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding these definitions for interpreting scripture and human nature in relation to God. The explanation is clear, well-supported with biblical references, and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. It could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how these concepts are applied in biblical narratives or by exploring how differing theological perspectives impact interpretations further."
