## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In Numbers 6:1-4, the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow are outlined as follows:

1. **Abstention from Alcohol**: Nazirites are forbidden from consuming wine, vinegar, or any other alcoholic drinks, including grapes and raisins. This restriction symbolizes a separation from ordinary social practices and indulgence.

2. **Avoidance of Haircuts**: During the period of the vow, a Nazirite must not cut their hair. The untrimmed hair is a visible sign of their dedication and commitment to God.

3. **Separation from the Dead**: Nazirites must avoid contact with corpses or graves, even if those deceased are family members. This prohibition underscores their dedication to holiness and purity during the vow.

These restrictions are aimed at creating a distinct lifestyle that reflects the individual's commitment to spiritual growth and devotion. The vow is typically temporary but can be extended based on the individual's dedication.
