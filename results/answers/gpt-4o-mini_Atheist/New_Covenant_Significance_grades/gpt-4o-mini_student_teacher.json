  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of the significance of the new covenant established through Jesus, touching on theological, historical, cultural, and ethical dimensions. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. While the student acknowledges the importance of Jesus' sacrifice and its implications, the connection to God's promises could be more explicitly woven throughout the response to align closely with the specified concern."
