  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Psalms in early Christian worship and teaching based on various New Testament passages. However, they did not directly address the specific instruction given in the reference answer regarding singing Psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him. It would have been stronger if they had directly referenced the explicit instruction given in the reference answer."
