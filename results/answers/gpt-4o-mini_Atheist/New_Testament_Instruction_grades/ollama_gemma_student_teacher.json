  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the textual evidence regarding the use of Psalms in the New Testament. They provide relevant examples from Ephesians 5:19 and Colossians 3:16 to support their claim that Psalms were used in early Christian worship and teaching. Additionally, the student acknowledges the lack of explicit instructions regarding Psalms but suggests their cultural and spiritual significance based on their references. However, the response could benefit from a clearer connection to the concern regarding applying biblical teachings to contemporary Christian worship."
