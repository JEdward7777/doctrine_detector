## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, the Psalms are often referenced and quoted, reflecting their significance in early Christian worship and teaching. While there are no explicit instructions exclusively focused on the Psalms, several passages highlight their role in the life of the Christian community.

One key reference is found in Ephesians 5:19, which encourages believers to speak to one another "with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit." This indicates the use of Psalms in communal worship and personal devotion.

Another example is Colossians 3:16, where Paul instructs the church to let the message of Christ dwell among them richly, teaching and admonishing one another with wisdom through "psalms, hymns, and songs." This suggests that the Psalms were integral in the formation of Christian teaching and communal life.

Furthermore, the New Testament writers often used Psalms to articulate the significance of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. For instance, in the Gospel of Matthew and in Acts, the Psalmist's words are used to explain prophetic fulfillments related to Jesus.

In summary, while there are no direct, prescriptive instructions about using Psalms in the New Testament, their references indicate a cultural and spiritual importance in worship, teaching, and reflection within the early Christian context.
