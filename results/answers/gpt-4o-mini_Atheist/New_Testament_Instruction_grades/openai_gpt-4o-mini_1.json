  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-supported analysis of the significance of the Psalms in early Christian worship and teaching based on New Testament references. It effectively demonstrates how biblical teachings about singing psalms to God are applied in contemporary Christian worship practices. The response could have incorporated more specific examples of how modern Christian communities continue to value and use the Psalms in their worship services to further strengthen the argument. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
