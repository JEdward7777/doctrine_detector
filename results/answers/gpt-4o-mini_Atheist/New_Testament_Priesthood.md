## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of every believer being considered a priest stems from the idea of the "priesthood of all believers," which is especially articulated in texts like 1 Peter 2:9 where it states, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession." This concept carries several important implications:

1. **Access to God**: In the Old Testament, access to God was primarily through the Levitical priesthood, which acted as intermediaries between God and the people. The New Testament teaches that through Jesus' sacrifice, all believers have direct access to God, eliminating the need for a human intermediary. This democratization of access emphasizes the personal relationship between each believer and God.

2. **Service and Worship**: The role of a priest includes serving, mediating, and offering sacrifices. In the New Testament understanding, believers are called to offer their lives as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1), engaging in acts of service and worship. This shifts the notion of priesthood from a specialized role to a broader call for all Christians to serve and worship in their daily lives.

3. **Community and Identity**: The priesthood of all believers also highlights the communal identity of the church. Believers are seen as a collective body that serves God. This fosters a sense of belonging and purpose within the Christian community, as every member has a role to play in contributing to the spiritual life of the church and the world.

4. **Mission and Evangelism**: As priests, believers are also called to share the message of Jesus and live out their faith in a way that reflects Godâ€™s love and grace to others. This missionary aspect emphasizes the responsibility of every believer to witness to their faith and to serve others, further blurring the line between clergy and laity.

5. **Spiritual Authority**: While traditional priesthood often involves formal authority and specific roles in worship, the New Testament teaches that all believers share in the authority to minister and proclaim the Gospel. This shifts the focus from institutional authority to spiritual empowerment.

In summary, the New Testament depiction of believers as priests signifies that every Christian is called to a direct relationship with God, a life of service, participation in the community, and a commitment to evangelism. This concept encourages inclusivity, responsibility, and active engagement in the life of faith.
