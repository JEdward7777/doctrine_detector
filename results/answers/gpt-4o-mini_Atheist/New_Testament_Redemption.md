## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of purification evolves significantly from the Old Testament to the New Testament, reflecting broader shifts in religious understanding and practice within the Judeo-Christian tradition.

In the Old Testament, purification is largely concerned with physical and ritual cleanliness. The laws outlined in the Torah (especially in Leviticus) demonstrate a system of purity codes that govern various aspects of life, including dietary laws, bodily discharges, and rituals associated with sin and atonement. For instance, sacrifices and specific cleansing rituals, such as the washing of hands or bodies, were essential for restoring a person's state of purity to participate fully in communal worship and in the presence of God. The concept of impurity was often associated with moral failure or disobedience to God's commandments and required ritualistic practices for restoration.

In contrast, the New Testament shifts the focus from ritual purity to spiritual and moral purification. Jesus’ teachings emphasize the inner transformation of the individual rather than mere adherence to external rituals. For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus discusses the importance of purity of heart and moral integrity, suggesting that true defilement comes from within a person rather than from external actions or statuses (Matthew 15:16-20). The idea of purification is redefined through concepts of forgiveness and grace. The sacrificial system is fulfilled in the death of Jesus, seen as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins, which fundamentally alters the understanding of how purification is achieved.

Furthermore, the New Testament introduces the idea of spiritual rebirth and baptism as a means of purification. Baptism symbolizes not only repentance and forgiveness but also a new identity in Christ, emphasizing a transformation that transcends traditional ritual purity (Acts 2:38). This shift indicates a move from ritual compliance to an emphasis on faith, inner transformation, and relationship with God.

Overall, the concept of purification transitions from a focus on ritualistic observances and laws to an emphasis on inner transformation, moral integrity, and a relational approach to God through faith and grace in the New Testament.
