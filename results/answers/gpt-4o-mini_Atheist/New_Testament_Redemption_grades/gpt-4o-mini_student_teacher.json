  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thorough explanation of how the concept of purification changes from the Old Testament to the New Testament, highlighting the shift from ritualistic purity to inner transformation and the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice. However, the student did not explicitly mention the sufficiency of Christ\u2019s sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin as the key concern specified in the grading criteria. This crucial aspect could have been emphasized more prominently in the response to align closely with the Christian-specific worldview."
