The student effectively highlights the shift from a focus on ritual purity to spiritual and moral transformation, emphasizing the importance of Jesus' sacrifice and the new identity in Christ. The connection to the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate purification from sin is particularly relevant and aligns with the specified concern."
