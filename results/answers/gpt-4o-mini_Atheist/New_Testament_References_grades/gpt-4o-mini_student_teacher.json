  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-reasoned answer connecting aspects of John the Baptist's life to the Nazirite vow, citing relevant Scripture references and historical context. However, the student missed the mention of the angel's announcement regarding John's abstention from strong drink, which the teacher's reference answer highlights as a crucial piece of evidence linking John to the Nazirite vow. The response could have been strengthened by including this specific reference, thus earning a slightly lower grade."
