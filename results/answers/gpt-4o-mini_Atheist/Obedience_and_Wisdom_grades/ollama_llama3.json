  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a well-rounded exploration of how listening to God can contribute to wisdom, covering various aspects such as introspection, moral guidance, community, empathy, mindfulness, and learning from adversity. The connection between these points is clear, and the discussion is informed by both psychological and philosophical perspectives.\n\nIn terms of recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom, the response falls short in explicitly highlighting this connection. While it mentions \"obeying His will\" in one instance, it does not thoroughly develop or emphasize this aspect as much as one might expect given the concern. However, the overall discussion does touch on themes related to humility, which is a key aspect of obedience.\n\nOverall, the response provides a strong foundation for understanding how listening to God can contribute to wisdom, and while it could benefit from more explicit attention to the connection between obedience and wisdom, it remains a well-written and informative piece."
