The response effectively expands on the initial answer by exploring various dimensions of how engaging with God can lead to wisdom. However, the response falls short of fully addressing the concern regarding the enhancement of one's spiritual journey through obedience to God. While the perspectives shared are valuable, a stronger emphasis on the spiritual aspect of obedience to God and its impact on spiritual growth would enhance the overall alignment with the given concern."
