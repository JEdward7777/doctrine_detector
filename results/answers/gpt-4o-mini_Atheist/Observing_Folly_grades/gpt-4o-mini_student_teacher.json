  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of actions categorized as folly in the Bible, aligning well with a Christian worldview. They referenced relevant scriptures and effectively highlighted the contrast between wisdom and folly. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly linking these actions to being against God's will, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a strong response showcasing a solid understanding of the topic."
