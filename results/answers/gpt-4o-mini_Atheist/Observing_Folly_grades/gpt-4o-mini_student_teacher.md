## [Answer](../Observing_Folly.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible presents various actions and attitudes that it categorizes as folly, often contrasting them with wisdom. Here are some examples:

1. **Ignoring Wisdom**: Proverbs 1:7 states, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction." This indicates that rejecting wisdom and guidance is inherently foolish.

2. **Lack of Discipline**: Proverbs 12:1 notes, "Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid." Here, the refusal to accept discipline or correction is seen as a foolish behavior.

3. **Pride and Arrogance**: Proverbs 11:2 says, "When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom." Pride is often associated with folly because it leads to poor decisions and alienates others.

4. **Quick Temper**: Proverbs 14:17 warns, "A quick-tempered person does foolish things, and the one who devises evil is hated." Acting impulsively in anger is characterized as a foolish choice.

5. **Being Overly Trusting**: Proverbs 14:15 states, "The simple believe anything, but the prudent give thought to their steps." Naivety and gullibility are viewed as foolish traits.

6. **Neglecting Responsibilities**: Proverbs 24:30-34 describes a lazy person who neglects their field and ends up in ruin, illustrating the folly of procrastination and irresponsibility.

7. **Acting Against Wisdom**: Ecclesiastes 10:1 observes, "As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor." This emphasizes how foolish actions can undermine one's wisdom and reputation.

8. **Dismissing Counsel**: Proverbs 15:22 says, "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed." Ignoring advice and counsel can lead to foolish outcomes.

These examples highlight a recurring theme in the Bible: folly often arises from a lack of self-awareness, humility, and the refusal to learn from experience or seek wise counsel.
