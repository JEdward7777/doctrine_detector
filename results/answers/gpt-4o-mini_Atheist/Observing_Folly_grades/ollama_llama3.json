  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of biblical concepts related to folly, including examples from Proverbs and Ecclesiastes that highlight the consequences of foolish actions. However, the answer does not fully address the concern about recognizing folly in one's actions encouraging better decision-making aligned with God's will. While the response mentions the recurring theme of self-awareness, humility, and seeking wise counsel, it could be improved by explicitly discussing how recognizing folly can lead to a more godly approach to decision-making.\n\nThe answer does a good job of explaining what constitutes folly in biblical terms, but could benefit from more explicit connections between recognizing folly and making decisions that align with God's will. Additionally, the response could have explored the practical implications of recognizing folly for one's own life and faith journey. Despite these limitations, the response shows a strong understanding of biblical teachings on folly and its consequences, which earns it an 85 grade."
