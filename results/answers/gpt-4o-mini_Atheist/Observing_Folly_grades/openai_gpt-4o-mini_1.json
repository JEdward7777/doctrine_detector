  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively elaborates on specific examples of folly as presented in the Bible and how they contrast with wisdom. The examples provided align well with the concern of recognizing folly to encourage better decision-making in line with God's will. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of how actions that go against God's will are viewed as foolish and dangerous. The application of biblical principles to practical behaviors is clear and insightful. Great job overall!"
