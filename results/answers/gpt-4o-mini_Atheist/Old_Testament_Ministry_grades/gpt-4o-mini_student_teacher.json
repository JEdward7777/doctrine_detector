  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and comprehensive explanation of how the priests carried out their ministry in the Old Testament temple. They covered key aspects such as the priestly class, sacrificial system, temple duties, teaching and judging roles, ritual purity, festivals and holy days, and the high priest's specific responsibilities. The answer demonstrated a strong understanding of the practices and significance of the priests' ministry. However, the student could have tied their detailed explanation back to the central idea of ministering to God through sacrifices, temple care, and prayer more explicitly to align closer with the reference answer."
