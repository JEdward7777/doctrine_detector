It effectively addresses the concern by connecting the practices of the Old Testament priesthood to current ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service. The response could have further emphasized the significance of the priests' role in mediating the relationship between God and the people, which is central to the Christian worldview in understanding the role of Christ as the ultimate High Priest who mediates between humanity and God through His sacrifice."
