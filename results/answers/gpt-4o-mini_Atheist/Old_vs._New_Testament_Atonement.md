## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of atonement varies significantly between the Old and New Testaments, influenced by the historical, cultural, and theological contexts of each.

In the Old Testament, atonement primarily revolves around the sacrificial system established in the Law of Moses (Torah). Key components include:

1. **Sacrificial Offerings**: Atonement is often achieved through animal sacrifices, where the shedding of blood symbolizes the covering of sin (e.g., Leviticus 17:11). Different types of offerings, such as burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings, served specific purposes and required adherence to ritual laws.

2. **Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)**: This is the most significant annual occasion for atonement, where the High Priest makes sacrifices for his own sins and for the sins of the people. The ritual also includes the symbolic sending away of a goat (the scapegoat) that carries the sins of the community into the wilderness (Leviticus 16).

3. **Covenantal Framework**: Atonement in the Old Testament is understood within the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing the need for obedience and the consequences of sin. The sacrificial system allows for restoration of that relationship.

In the New Testament, the understanding of atonement transforms, largely through the figure of Jesus Christ:

1. **Jesus as the Ultimate Sacrifice**: The New Testament posits that Jesus' death on the cross serves as the ultimate and final sacrifice for sin (Hebrews 10:11-14). His atonement is understood not just as a covering for sin but as a complete removal and reconciliation of humanity with God.

2. **Grace and Faith**: Atonement in the New Testament shifts emphasis from works and adherence to the law to faith and grace. Believers are invited to accept Christ's sacrifice as sufficient for their salvation, emphasizing personal faith rather than ritualistic practices (Ephesians 2:8-9).

3. **Universal Scope**: Unlike the Old Testament, where atonement is primarily for the Israelite community, the New Testament extends the offer of atonement to all of humanity, inviting Gentiles into the fold and emphasizing the breaking down of barriers (Acts 10, Romans 10:12-13).

4. **Transformation and New Covenant**: The New Testament describes atonement within the framework of a new covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Luke 22:20). This reflects an internal transformation, where God's laws are written on believers' hearts, leading to a life marked by love and obedience rather than mere ritual compliance.

In summary, while both the Old and New Testaments address atonement, the former is largely focused on ritual sacrifices within a specific covenant community, while the latter emphasizes the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice, grace, faith, and a universal call to salvation.
