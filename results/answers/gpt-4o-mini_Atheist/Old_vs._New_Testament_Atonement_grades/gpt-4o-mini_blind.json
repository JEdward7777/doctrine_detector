The student effectively outlines key differences in sacrificial practices, covenantal frameworks, the role of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice, the shift towards grace and faith, the universal scope of atonement, and the theme of a new covenant in the New Testament. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the doctrinal differences in atonement theology between the two testaments."
