  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured comparison of the concept of atonement between the Old and New Testaments, addressing key differences in sacrificial practices, covenantal frameworks, the role of Jesus Christ, and the scope of atonement. The response effectively clarified the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history while demonstrating a solid understanding of the underlying theological principles. The integration of relevant biblical references enriches the content and supports the student's analysis."
