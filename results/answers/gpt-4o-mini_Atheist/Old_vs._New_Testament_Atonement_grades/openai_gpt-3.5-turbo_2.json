It effectively highlights the key differences in atonement between the two biblical periods, emphasizing the sufficiency and universality of Christ's sacrifice. The only slight room for improvement would be to directly tie the concept of temporary sacrifices in the Old Testament to the idea of pointing forward to Christ's ultimate sacrifice for all sins forever in the New Testament."
