  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and thoughtful response with practical strategies for translating the concept of 'One God' to cultures that respect multiple deities. However, the answer lacks a direct emphasis on God's unique nature and the concept of the Trinity, which are essential aspects of biblical monotheism. The student should have included more explicit references to these core Christian teachings to fully address the concern provided."
