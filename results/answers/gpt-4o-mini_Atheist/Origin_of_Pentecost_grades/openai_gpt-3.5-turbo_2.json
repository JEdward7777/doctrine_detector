It effectively connects the festival to the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, thereby setting the stage for understanding its fulfillment in Christ. The mention of Shavuot as a foundation that would later be transformed in the New Testament to signify the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the Christian church effectively connects the festival to its ultimate fulfillment in Christ."
