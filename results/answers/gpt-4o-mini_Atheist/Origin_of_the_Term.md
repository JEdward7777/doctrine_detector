## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
According to the New Testament, the followers of Jesus were first called 'Christians' in Antioch. This is mentioned in the Book of Acts, specifically in Acts 11:26, which states, "And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians." Antioch was a significant early center for the spread of Christianity, and this label likely arose as followers of Jesus distinguished themselves from other groups and as the movement began to gain broader recognition.
