## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
According to the New Testament, the followers of Jesus were first called 'Christians' in Antioch. This is mentioned in the Book of Acts, specifically in Acts 11:26, which states, "And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians." Antioch was a significant early center for the spread of Christianity, and this label likely arose as followers of Jesus distinguished themselves from other groups and as the movement began to gain broader recognition.

Comment: The student accurately identified Antioch as the location where Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' and provided a relevant Bible reference to support their answer. They also noted the significance of this event in the spread of Christianity. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to elaborate further on the historical context and significance of the term 'Christian' within the early Christian community.
