## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
According to the New Testament, the followers of Jesus were first called 'Christians' in Antioch. This is mentioned in the Book of Acts, specifically in Acts 11:26, which states, "And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians." Antioch was a significant early center for the spread of Christianity, and this label likely arose as followers of Jesus distinguished themselves from other groups and as the movement began to gain broader recognition.

Comment: The response provides some accurate information about the origin of the term "Christians" in Antioch, but it falls short in terms of recognizing the historical context and significance of this term. The original response only mentions the city of Antioch without providing any additional context or explanation. While it is true that Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in Antioch, the response could have benefited from a more nuanced understanding of why this label arose and its implications for the early Christian community.
