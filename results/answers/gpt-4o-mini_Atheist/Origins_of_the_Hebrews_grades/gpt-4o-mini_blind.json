  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a well-written and informative response that accurately explains the biblical origins of the Hebrew people. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the genealogical lineage from Abraham to the twelve tribes of Israel. The mention of Eber and the broader historical context of the Hebrew people adds depth to the explanation. Overall, a strong response with only minor room for improvement."
