## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, the Hebrews are traditionally considered to be descendants of the patriarch Abraham. According to biblical genealogies, Abraham is the father of Isaac, who is the father of Jacob. Jacob, who is also known as Israel, has twelve sons, and these sons are the forefathers of the twelve tribes of Israel. Thus, the Hebrews are often viewed as the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

The term "Hebrew" itself is thought to derive from "Eber," an ancestor mentioned in Genesis, who is a great-grandson of Shem, one of Noah's sons. This linguistic connection reflects the broader cultural and ethnic identity of the group that emerged in ancient times, eventually becoming known as the Israelites and later the Jewish people. 

The historical and archaeological understanding of the Hebrews is complex, involving various migrations, sociopolitical developments, and cultural exchanges in the ancient Near East.
