  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85. The student effectively explains the significance of Passover for Christians in relation to Jesus, drawing connections between the old covenant of Passover and the new covenant established through Jesus. The student accurately highlights Jesus as the \"Lamb of God\" and discusses the symbolism of sacrifice and redemption, as well as the parallels between the Passover meal and the Last Supper. Additionally, the student emphasizes the anticipation of salvation through Jesus and the intertwining of Jewish and Christian beliefs. However, the student's answer could be improved by directly stating how Jesus is seen as the Passover Lamb representing His sinless sacrifice for humanity, as noted in the reference answer."
