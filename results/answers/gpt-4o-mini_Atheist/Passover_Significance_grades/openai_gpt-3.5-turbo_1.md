# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The celebration of Passover holds significant meaning for Christians, particularly in relation to Jesus Christ, as it helps to contextualize his life and teachings within the framework of Jewish tradition. Passover commemorates the Exodus, when the Israelites were liberated from slavery in Egypt, marked by the ritual of sacrificing a lamb and spreading its blood on the doorposts as a sign for the angel of death to pass over their homes.

For Christians, this celebration is deeply symbolic, as Jesus is often referred to as the "Lamb of God." In the New Testament, particularly in the Gospel of John, Jesus' crucifixion coincides with Passover, which underscores the theme of sacrifice and redemption. Christians interpret the Last Supper, which Jesus shared with his disciples before his crucifixion, as a Passover meal, emphasizing the connection between the old covenant of Passover and the new covenant established through Jesus' death and resurrection.

Thus, for Christians, Passover signifies not only a historical event in Jewish tradition but also represents the anticipation of salvation through Jesus, portraying him as the ultimate sacrifice who delivers humanity from sin, akin to how the lamb's blood delivered the Israelites from death. This dual significance highlights the intertwining of Jewish and Christian beliefs and the shared roots of these two faiths.
