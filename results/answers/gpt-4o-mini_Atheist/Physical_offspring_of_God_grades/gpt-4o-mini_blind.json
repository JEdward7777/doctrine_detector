The approach covers various aspects such as historical context, biblical interpretation, theological perspectives, language and metaphor, comparative theology, and the importance of engaging in dialogue. However, to enhance the response from a Christian specific worldview, it would be beneficial to include stronger references to biblical passages that clarify the metaphorical understanding of \"Son of God\" in relation to Christ's divinity rather than a biological relationship with God. Emphasizing the scriptural basis for this concept would further solidify the doctrinal correctness of the explanation."
