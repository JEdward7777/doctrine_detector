  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-thought-out approach to clarifying the term \"Son of God\" for someone who interprets it as implying physical offspring of God. They effectively incorporate historical, biblical, theological, linguistic, and comparative perspectives to address the concern. However, the teacher's reference answer is more concise and straightforward in explicitly stating that \"Son of God\" refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, which is the key point to emphasize from a Christian perspective. The student's response is thorough but could benefit from a more direct focus on this central teaching point."
