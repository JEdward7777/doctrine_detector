  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of proper teaching by providing a comprehensive explanation of the term \"Son of God\" in various contexts, including historical, biblical, theological, linguistic, and comparative perspectives. The approach emphasizes the metaphorical and symbolic nature of Jesus' sonship, highlighting its connection to his divine nature and relationship with God.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be even more explicit in its emphasis on preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology. While it does acknowledge the importance of proper teaching, it could further underscore the significance of this approach in avoiding misinterpretations and promoting a deeper understanding of Scripture.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a thorough and well-rounded explanation that should help readers develop a more nuanced understanding of the term \"Son of God\" and its implications for Christian theology."
