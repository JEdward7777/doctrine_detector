However, the response falls short from a Christian worldview perspective as it lacks a clear emphasis on the biblical understanding of 'perish' and the eternal consequences tied to it for those who do not trust in Jesus. The answer could benefit from incorporating more scriptural references and focusing on the Christian perspective on the distinction between physical death and spiritual death."
