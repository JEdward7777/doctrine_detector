  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and insightful response that carefully differentiates between physical death and the spiritual concept of 'perish'. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the various philosophical, cultural, and religious perspectives on both concepts. The response is also commendable for acknowledging the interplay between the two and exploring the subjective experiences of meaning and existence. While the teacher's reference answer focuses on a specific religious perspective, the student's response provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the topic."
