The response acknowledges the importance of understanding the eternal consequences in a spiritual context, particularly for those who do not trust in Jesus. However, it could further emphasize the Christian perspective on how Jesus' sacrifice offers redemption from spiritual perishing. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the differentiation between physical and spiritual death within a Christian worldview."
