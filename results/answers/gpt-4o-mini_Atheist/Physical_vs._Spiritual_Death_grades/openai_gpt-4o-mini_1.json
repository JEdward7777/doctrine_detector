  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the distinction between physical death and spiritual \"perishing,\" considering various philosophical, cultural, and religious perspectives. The emphasis on the eternal consequences of spiritual \"perishing\" for those who do not trust in Jesus aligns well with a Christian worldview. The explanation is clear and effectively addresses the concern regarding clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect the discussion to the specific concern raised in the prompt."
