  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of predestination in a Christian context, discussing its theological foundations and different interpretations within Christian denominations. The response effectively addresses the concern raised regarding the relationship between predestination and salvation. The only improvement could be to reinforce the centrality of God's role in predestination as the teacher's reference answer emphasizes that God decides beforehand, while the student's answer leans slightly more towards discussing theological interpretations and variations."
