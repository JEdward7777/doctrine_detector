  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of predestination in a Christian context. It clearly articulates the theological basis for the belief, particularly referencing John Calvin's teachings. Additionally, the student provides a nuanced explanation of the different interpretations of predestination among Christian denominations. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the relationship between predestination and free will, which is a significant concern in Christian theology."
