  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer on how the term \"Daughter of Zion\" is utilized in Biblical prophecies. They correctly highlighted the symbol of Jerusalem, expressions of grief and hope, emphasis on the divine relationship, and messianic expectations associated with the term. However, the answer could have been improved by further emphasizing the importance of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context to better apply the scriptures today. The student's response was insightful and demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, but could have linked it more explicitly to the concern provided."
