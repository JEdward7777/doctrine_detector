  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the concept of \"Daughter of Zion\" in biblical prophecy, highlighting its connection to the city of Jerusalem, Israel's spiritual and national identity, and its association with themes of hope, restoration, and divine relationship. The discussion also touches on the prophetic nature of the term and its historical context.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples from scripture to illustrate each point, rather than relying solely on general statements. Additionally, while the concern is recognized in the response, it would benefit from a more explicit application of the concept to contemporary Christian life or practice.\n\nComment: Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of \"Daughter of Zion\" and its significance in prophetic literature. To take it to the next level, consider providing more concrete examples from scripture to support your points and explicitly exploring how this concept can be applied to faith and practice today."
