Discerning a sense of 'calling' or 'purpose' is a deeply personal and often complex journey, regardless of one's belief system. While many people turn to religious texts like the Bible for guidance, there are practical steps one can take that can resonate across various worldviews:

1. **Self-Reflection**: Spend time reflecting on your interests, passions, and strengths. What activities make you feel fulfilled? What issues are you passionate about? Understanding yourself is a crucial first step.

2. **Seek Wisdom**: Engage with philosophical literature, mentorship, or counseling that challenges and supports your thinking. Learning from those who have navigated similar paths can provide valuable insights.

3. **Explore Community Involvement**: Participate in different community activities or volunteer work. Engaging with diverse groups can expose you to various perspectives and needs, helping you identify where you might feel called to contribute.

4. **Experiment and Experience**: Sometimes, the best way to discover your purpose is through trying different paths. Internships, classes, or new hobbies can provide insights into what resonates with you.

5. **Consult Your Values**: Consider what is most important to you. Reflecting on your core values can guide you toward pursuits that align with your ethical framework and aspirations for making a positive impact.

6. **Mindfulness and Intuition**: Practices like meditation or journaling can help clarify your thoughts and feelings. Paying attention to your intuition about what feels right may reveal pathways that align with your sense of purpose.

7. **Engage in Dialogue**: Discuss your thoughts and feelings about your purpose with others. Engaging in conversations can trigger new ideas and help you see your situation from different angles.

8. **Stay Open to Change**: Understand that your purpose can evolve over time. What may feel like your calling at one stage of life could shift as your experiences and circumstances change.

While these steps do not provide a definitive answer, they are tools for personal exploration that can help individuals navigate their journey toward discovering their calling, irrespective of religious frameworks.
