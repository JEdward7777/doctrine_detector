  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provides some practical and insightful steps for discovering one's calling or purpose, the answer lacks a foundation rooted in a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, the primary means of discerning one's calling should involve prayer, studying Scripture, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, and understanding how one's gifts and passions align with God's will. The student's answer, while comprehensive in a general sense, falls short in addressing the specific concern of finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life as described in the Bible."
