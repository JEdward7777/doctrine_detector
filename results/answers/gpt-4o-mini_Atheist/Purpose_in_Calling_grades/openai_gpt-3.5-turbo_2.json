However, from a Christian worldview, it lacks a strong emphasis on seeking guidance from God through prayer, studying Scripture, and being led by the Holy Spirit. While the steps mentioned can be beneficial in a general sense, they fall short in the specific concern of finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life. Integrating a stronger emphasis on a Christian-specific approach to discerning one's calling would significantly enhance the response."
