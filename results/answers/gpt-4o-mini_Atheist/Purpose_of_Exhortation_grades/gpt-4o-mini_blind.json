  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of the primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament. The student effectively elaborates on how exhortation serves to encourage, instruct, and uplift believers in their faith, drawing upon relevant biblical passages to support their points. The mention of admonishment and correction as part of exhortation is also insightful. To enhance the response, the student could have included more specific references from the New Testament to further illustrate the concept of exhortation and its importance in the Christian faith. Great job overall."
