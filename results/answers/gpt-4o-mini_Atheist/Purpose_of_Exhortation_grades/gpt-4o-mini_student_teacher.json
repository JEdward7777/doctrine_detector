  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Based on the indicated concern and reference answer provided, the student's response, while comprehensive and well-supported with biblical references, does not directly address the specific Christian perspective of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will as the primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament. The student's answer focuses more on general encouragement, instruction, and upliftment without emphasizing the core aspect of steering believers towards God's will and away from sin.\n\nGrade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of exhortation in the New Testament context, covering various aspects of encouragement and support in the faith journey. However, the response could be improved by explicitly connecting the primary purpose of exhortation to persuading individuals to avoid sin and align with God's will as highlighted in the reference answer."
