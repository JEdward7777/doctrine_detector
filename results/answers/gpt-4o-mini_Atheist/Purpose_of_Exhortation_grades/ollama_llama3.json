  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, highlighting the importance of exhortation in encouraging believers to live according to the teachings of Jesus and the principles of the Christian faith. The examples from Hebrews and 1 Thessalonians are relevant and well-chosen, illustrating the communal aspect of faith and the call to encourage one another.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from more explicit connection between exhortation and biblical commands or principles. While it is implied that exhortation is tied to following God's will, a clearer explanation of how this ties back to specific scriptures or theological concepts would strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides relevant biblical examples to support its claims."
