  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively addresses the concern by providing a detailed explanation of the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, supported by relevant scripture references. The interpretation aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of uplifting and supporting fellow believers in their walk with God. The response could be strengthened by further elaborating on how exhortation also includes aspects of instruction and moral guidance, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical principles regarding encouragement in the Christian faith."
