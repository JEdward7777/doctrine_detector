The inclusion of specific biblical passages and the mention of admonishment and correction align well with the concern about understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. The response effectively conveys the importance of exhortation in guiding individuals toward spiritual maturity and aligning with God's will. Great job in tying it back to the Christian worldview!"
