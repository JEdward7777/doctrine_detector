  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive analysis of the purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings from various perspectives, such as engagement, reflection, concealment, and societal relevance, there is a lack of specific reference to the core reason highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The teacher emphasized that Jesus used parables to teach moral truths, revealing truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe. The student's response could be enhanced by clearly connecting their elaborate points to this fundamental aspect of teaching moral truths through parables. Strengthening this connection would align the student's insights more closely with the Christian worldview understanding of Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith."
