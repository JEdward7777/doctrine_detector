  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a more comprehensive understanding of Jesus' use of parables, going beyond the simple notion that he used them to teach moral truths. While the answer you provided does touch on this aspect, it doesn't fully capture the complexity and depth of Jesus' teaching methods as described in the response. The additional points made about engagement, invitation to reflection, concealment and revelation, and cultural context add richness and nuance to our understanding of Jesus' use of parables. However, the response could still benefit from a more explicit connection between these teaching methods and their implications for faith. Nonetheless, it demonstrates a strong grasp of the broader significance of Jesus' parabolic teachings.\n\n(Note: I gave 20 points for going beyond the simple answer and providing a more comprehensive understanding of Jesus' use of parables. Another 10 points were given for the depth and nuance added to our understanding of Jesus' teaching methods, and 50 points for demonstrating a strong grasp of the broader significance of Jesus' parabolic teachings.)"
