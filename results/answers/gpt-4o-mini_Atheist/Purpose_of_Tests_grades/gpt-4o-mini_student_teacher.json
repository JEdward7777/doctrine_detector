  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of tests from a scholarly, atheistic perspective and explores various cultural purposes of tests within religious traditions. However, the key concern of the nature of tests affecting a believer's response to difficult circumstances is not directly addressed in the answer. From a Christian-specific worldview, the primary purpose of tests is to lead believers to recognize their sin, repent, and draw closer to God. The student's response lacks this crucial focus on spiritual growth and relationship with God, hence the lower grade."
