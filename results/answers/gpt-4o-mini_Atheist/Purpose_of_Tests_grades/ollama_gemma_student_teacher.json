  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of tests in a Christian worldview. They provide a comprehensive analysis of various perspectives on tests, including psychological, social, and literary. However, the response lacks a specific mention of the idea that tests are used by God to expose sin and draw believers closer to him. This is a key element of the teacher's reference answer, which is not fully addressed in the student's submission."
