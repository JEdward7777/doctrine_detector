  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85.\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the term 'Rabbi' in the context of Christian teaching, including its meaning and significance in relation to Jesus and early Christianity. The answer effectively explains the role of a Rabbi as a Jewish teacher or religious leader and how it relates to the teaching and authority of Jesus in the New Testament. The student effectively connects the term 'Rabbi' to themes of wisdom, authority, and Jesus' Jewish heritage.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could have been improved by directly stating that the term 'Rabbi' means 'my master' or 'my teacher' and specifically emphasizing its connection to teaching God's laws, as per the reference answer provided by the teacher. By aligning more closely with the reference answer and focusing on this specific aspect, the student's response would have been even stronger."
