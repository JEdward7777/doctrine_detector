  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Jesus being referred to as a ransom in Christianity. They effectively link the concept to theological ideas of atonement, redemption, covenantal language, moral implications, and eschatological dimensions. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian beliefs and effectively communicates the significance of this aspect of Christian theology. Great job overall!"
