It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how the Babylonian destruction and subsequent return of the Israelites led to the rebuilding of the Temple. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and significance of these events, within a Christian worldview that acknowledges the importance of the Temple in Old Testament history."
