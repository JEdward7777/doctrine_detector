  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful comparison of the concept of redemption in the Bible to the practice of redeeming people or property in ancient Israel. They have accurately highlighted the spiritual and social dimensions of redemption in both contexts and connected them well to the Christian faith. The student effectively demonstrated an understanding of the significance of redemption in Christian theology, making strong connections between the biblical concept of redemption and Jesus' sacrificial act. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by placing a greater emphasis on the centrality of Jesus' role in redemption within the Christian worldview, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
