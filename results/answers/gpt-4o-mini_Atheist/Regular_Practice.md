## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist, as a regular practice for believers primarily to commemorate and enact the significance of Jesus' sacrifice. In his letters, particularly in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, Paul recounts the Last Supper and emphasizes the importance of remembering Jesus' body and blood through the elements of bread and wine. 

The establishment of the Lord's Supper serves several key purposes:

1. **Remembrance**: It functions as a ritual of remembrance, allowing the community of believers to continuously reflect on Christ's death and resurrection. This act of remembrance helps to keep the core of Christian faith central to communal and individual life.

2. **Community and Unity**: The Lord's Supper is a communal act that fosters unity among believers. It symbolizes the shared faith and collective identity of the church as the body of Christ, reinforcing the idea of fellowship and mutual support among members.

3. **Covenant**: By participating in the Lord's Supper, believers reaffirm the new covenant established by Jesus. Paul stresses that this practice serves as a proclamation of faith, highlighting both the past event of Christ’s sacrifice and the future hope of His return.

4. **Spiritual Nourishment**: Paul viewed the Lord's Supper as a means of spiritual sustenance, providing believers with strength and grace in their spiritual journey. It allows participants to engage deeply with their faith and derive meaning from their communal worship.

5. **Ethical and Moral Reflection**: In his instructions regarding the Lord’s Supper, Paul also emphasizes self-examination and the need for believers to approach the practice with sincerity and integrity, addressing how their behaviors reflect their commitment to the teachings of Jesus.

By instituting the Lord's Supper, Paul aimed to create a rich, meaningful tradition that would enhance the faith experience of early Christians, consolidate community bonds, and encourage a reflective and accountable practice of their beliefs.
