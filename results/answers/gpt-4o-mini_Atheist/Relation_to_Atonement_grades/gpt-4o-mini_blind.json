  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of how the terms 'propitiation' and 'atonement' relate to each other within theological contexts. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the distinctions between the two terms and their significance in religious traditions. The explanation is well-structured and effectively conveys the relationship between propitiation as a subset of atonement. The student could further enhance the answer by integrating specific examples or references from Christian theology to support the discussion. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated, but deeper theological analysis or application could have improved the response."
