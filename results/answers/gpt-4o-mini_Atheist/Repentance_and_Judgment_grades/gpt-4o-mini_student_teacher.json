  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: \nThe student provides a comprehensive and well-supported answer regarding the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God, referencing various Biblical passages to support their points. They effectively communicate the importance of repentance in avoiding God's judgment and seeking His mercy. However, the student could strengthen their answer by explicitly stating that repentance is not just a means to alleviate divine wrath, but a necessary response to God's holiness and a turning away from sin towards Him. Emphasizing the foundational aspect of repentance in the Christian faith would provide a more nuanced perspective. Overall, a solid effort with room for slight improvement in theological depth."
