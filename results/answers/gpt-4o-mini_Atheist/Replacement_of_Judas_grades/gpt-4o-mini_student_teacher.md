## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and subsequently died, Matthias was chosen to replace him among the twelve apostles. This selection is described in the Book of Acts, specifically Acts 1:15-26, where the remaining apostles cast lots to determine who would take Judas's place. Matthias was then numbered with the eleven apostles, restoring the group back to twelve.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided an accurate and well-supported answer citing the appropriate biblical reference. However, the answer could have been strengthened by highlighting the significance of maintaining the continuity of apostolic leadership after Judas Iscariot's betrayal and subsequent vacancy in the group of twelve apostles. This connection to the concern provided would have further demonstrated a deeper understanding of the Christian worldview regarding apostolic succession.
