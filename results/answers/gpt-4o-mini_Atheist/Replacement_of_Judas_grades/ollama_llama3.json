  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, which is in line with the correct answer. Additionally, it mentions the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, as described in Acts 1:15-26. However, the response could be improved by providing more context and details about the significance of Matthias being chosen to replace Judas, such as his qualifications or the role he played in the early Christian church. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account and its relevance to recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.\n\nNote: The grade is 85 because the response addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, but could be more thorough in its explanation."
