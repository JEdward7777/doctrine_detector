## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and subsequently died, Matthias was chosen to replace him among the twelve apostles. This selection is described in the Book of Acts, specifically Acts 1:15-26, where the remaining apostles cast lots to determine who would take Judas's place. Matthias was then numbered with the eleven apostles, restoring the group back to twelve.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately identifies Matthias as the replacement for Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death. However, there could be a higher grade if the response went further to highlight the importance of apostolic succession and the continuity of leadership within the early Christian community following Jesus' ascension. This would provide a more comprehensive Christian worldview perspective on the significance of Matthias' appointment.
