## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and subsequently died, Matthias was chosen to replace him among the twelve apostles. This selection is described in the Book of Acts, specifically Acts 1:15-26, where the remaining apostles cast lots to determine who would take Judas's place. Matthias was then numbered with the eleven apostles, restoring the group back to twelve.

Comment: The response accurately identifies Matthias as the replacement for Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death. However, the concern about recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension is not fully addressed. To enhance the response, it would be beneficial to include a brief explanation on how the selection of Matthias helped maintain the apostolic succession and leadership within the early Christian community.
