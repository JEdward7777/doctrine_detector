  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a good summary of Peter's address to the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. It accurately highlights Peter's emphasis on the crowd's complicity in the act, the acknowledgment of guilt, and the call for repentance. However, to improve the grade, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Peter's message, specifically emphasizing the significance of God's predetermined plan in the redemptive narrative. Expanding on the theological aspect would have enriched the analysis and provided a more comprehensive understanding of Peter's address."
