The connection between the crowd's guilt, God's predetermined plan, and the call for repentance is effectively explained within a Christian worldview. The emphasis on the dual themes of accountability and redemption aligns well with the early church's preaching. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful analysis. Great job!"
