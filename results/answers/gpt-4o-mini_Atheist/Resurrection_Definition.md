## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In a Christian context, the term 'resurrection' primarily refers to the belief in the rising of Jesus Christ from the dead after his crucifixion. This event is central to Christian faith, symbolizing victory over sin and death, and is celebrated on Easter Sunday. 

The resurrection is also linked to the promise of eternal life for believers, suggesting that just as Christ was raised, those who have faith in him will also be resurrected at the end of times. This belief is supported by New Testament scriptures, particularly in the Gospels and Paulâ€™s letters, where the resurrection is presented as a foundational event that validates Jesus' divine nature and teachings.

Beyond the individual meaning, the resurrection is part of the broader theological framework in Christianity that includes themes of redemption, hope, and the transformation of existence. It signifies not just a physical revival but also a profound spiritual reawakening and the affirmation of life beyond earthly existence.
