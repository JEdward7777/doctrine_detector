  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-articulated explanation of the concept of resurrection in a Christian context, highlighting its significance in Christian belief and its theological implications. However, the concern specified a focus on the fundamental concept of resurrection in relation to Christian beliefs about life after death. While the student's answer does touch on the broader themes associated with resurrection, it may benefit from a more direct emphasis on the core belief in resurrection as an essential aspect of Christian faith and the assurance of life after death through Christ's resurrection."
