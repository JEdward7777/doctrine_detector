  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the response as 90.\n\nThe student's response effectively expands on the fundamental concept of resurrection provided in the answer by emphasizing its significance in Christianity, particularly focusing on Jesus Christ's resurrection and its implications for believers. They connect it to themes of redemption, hope, and eternal life, demonstrating a solid understanding of the importance of resurrection in Christian faith. The only slight improvement would be to provide more direct references to specific biblical passages supporting these beliefs.\n\nGreat job overall in addressing the concern within a Christian worldview!"
