The central message of refraining from judgment and condemnation is rooted in the idea of God's ultimate authority as the judge, and the call for believers to reflect His character in their interactions with others. The focus on cultural and ethical perspectives, while important, should have been supplemented with a more explicit connection to the biblical teaching on judgment and forgiveness. The response would have benefited from a deeper exploration of the theological implications of the verse and its application within a Christian worldview."
