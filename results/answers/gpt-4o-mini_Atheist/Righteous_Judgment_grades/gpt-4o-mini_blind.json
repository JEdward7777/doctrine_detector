The points presented are firmly grounded in Christian theology and offer a balanced perspective on the issue. The inclusion of scriptural references and the emphasis on the redemptive purpose of God's wrath are commendable. However, the response could be strengthened by further emphasizing the foundational role of God's holiness in understanding His wrath and justice. Additionally, connecting the concept of wrath to the broader narrative of salvation history, emphasizing the significance of Jesus Christ's sacrifice in resolving the tension between wrath and mercy, would enhance the overall theological coherence of the answer."
