  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided an in-depth and well-organized response that explores different perspectives within Christian theology on reconciling God's wrath with His nature as loving and merciful. The student effectively addressed the concern by demonstrating an understanding of how God's attributes coexist without contradiction in Biblical teaching. The student's answer was comprehensive and displayed a strong knowledge of Christian theology and doctrine. The grade is slightly lower than 100 as there could have been a stronger emphasis on the core Christian belief that God's wrath is a part of His justice and holiness and is ultimately balanced by His love and mercy, as highlighted in the reference answer."
