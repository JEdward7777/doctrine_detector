## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Angels serve God in several distinct roles and functions, according to various biblical references. Here are a few ways they are described as serving:

1. **Messengers**: The term "angel" itself comes from the Greek word "angelos," meaning "messenger." In passages like Luke 1:26-38, the angel Gabriel delivers the message of Jesus’s impending birth to Mary. Similarly, in Genesis 19, angels are sent to warn Lot about the impending destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.

2. **Worshippers**: Angels are often depicted as beings who worship and glorify God. In Isaiah 6:1-3, seraphim are shown praising God in His heavenly throne room, and Revelation 4:8 describes four living creatures that give glory, honor, and thanks to God.

3. **Servants and Helpers**: Angels are tasked with serving God's will and assisting His people. Psalm 103:20 speaks of angels as mighty ones who do God's bidding and obey His word. In Hebrews 1:14, it is noted that angels are ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation.

4. **Protectors**: Angels are also seen as guardians. For example, Psalm 91:11-12 mentions that God commands His angels to guard and protect His followers. In the book of Daniel, an angel is sent to protect and help Daniel during difficult times.

5. **Agents of Judgment**: Angels can act as executors of God’s judgment. The angel of death in Exodus 12:29 brings judgment upon Egypt during the Passover. Similarly, in Revelation, angels are depicted as carrying out God's judgments during the end times.

6. **Guides and Intermediaries**: Angels sometimes act as guides or intermediaries between God and humans. In Acts 8:26, an angel instructs Philip to go south to the road leading to Gaza, leading to the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch.

These examples illustrate the varied roles that angels play in the biblical narrative, emphasizing their function in carrying out God's will and serving His purposes in the world.
