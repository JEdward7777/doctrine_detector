  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive overview of the various roles angels play in serving God according to biblical references, there is a concern with the level of depth and focus on the impact on Christian perceptions of divine intervention. The student's response is well-researched and covers a wide range of roles angels undertake. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by emphasizing how understanding these roles can impact a Christian's view of God's involvement in their lives more explicitly. By connecting the roles of angels to personal experiences of divine intervention, the student could have further demonstrated the significance of these roles in shaping Christian belief and faith."
