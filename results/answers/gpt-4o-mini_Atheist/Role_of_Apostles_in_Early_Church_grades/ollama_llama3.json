  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response demonstrates a clear understanding of community and teaching as integral aspects of church life, as modeled by the apostles. The author provides a comprehensive analysis of the apostles' actions, highlighting key lessons that can be applied to both religious and secular contexts. The response effectively uses biblical examples to illustrate these principles, such as commitment to education, building relationships, inclusivity, service, adaptability, shared purpose, conflict resolution, and communal practices.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not explicitly connect the apostles' actions to Jesus' teachings or the broader mission of the church. However, this oversight does not detract significantly from the overall strength of the response.\n\nWell done!"
