The response aligns well with the given answer, emphasizing faithful service, gift utilization, and kingdom advancement.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be even more explicit about how these various roles contribute to the life of the Church and furthering God's kingdom. Nevertheless, the overall quality and thoroughness of the response earn it a high grade."
