It aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of serving others, using spiritual gifts for the edification of the Church, and advancing God's kingdom. The only minor improvement could be to include a specific reference to the scriptural basis for these responsibilities, further solidifying the argument from a Christian perspective."
