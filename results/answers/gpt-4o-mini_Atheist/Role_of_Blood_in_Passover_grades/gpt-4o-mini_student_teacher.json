  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that delves into the historical, cultural, and theological significance of the blood in the Passover event. They connected the symbol of the blood to themes of protection, identity, and liberation, recognizing its importance across different faith traditions. However, the answer could be strengthened by emphasizing the Christian perspective on sacrifice and atonement more explicitly, in alignment with the concern provided. The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the complexity of the Passover event but could benefit from a clearer focus on the Christian interpretation of sacrifice and atonement as central themes in understanding the significance of the blood."
