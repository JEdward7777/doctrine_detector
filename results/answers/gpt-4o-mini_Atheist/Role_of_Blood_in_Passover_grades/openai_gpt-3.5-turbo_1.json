However, the concern regarding the importance of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith could have been addressed more directly by elaborating on how the Passover event prefigured the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God for the atonement of sin. Nonetheless, the response effectively highlights the broader spiritual meanings associated with the blood symbolism in both Jewish and Christian contexts."
