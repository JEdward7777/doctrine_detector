The connection to the Christian faith is addressed by linking the Passover lamb to Jesus Christ as the \"Lamb of God,\" highlighting themes of sacrifice and deliverance. However, the response could further elaborate on the concept of atonement in the Christian faith and how the Passover event foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Christ for the atonement of sin."
