However, the response lacks a Christian-specific worldview in addressing how the role of eunuchs may or may not reflect God's plan for different individuals in society. From a Christian perspective, one could explore concepts such as God's sovereignty, the dignity of every individual, and the importance of fulfilling one's God-given purpose. Encouraging the student to integrate these theological aspects into their analysis would strengthen the answer."
