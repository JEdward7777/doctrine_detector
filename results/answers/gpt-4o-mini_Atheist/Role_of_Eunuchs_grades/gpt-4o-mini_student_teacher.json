  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a well-thought-out examination of the roles of eunuchs in ancient societies from a sociocultural perspective. However, the student misses addressing the concern of understanding the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, irrespective of their physical or social status from a Christian worldview. The student's analysis focuses more on societal adaptability and individual contributions rather than aligning it with God's plan. The student could improve their answer by incorporating the idea that God can use anyone, regardless of physical state, to fulfill His purposes and plans in society, as highlighted in the reference answer."
