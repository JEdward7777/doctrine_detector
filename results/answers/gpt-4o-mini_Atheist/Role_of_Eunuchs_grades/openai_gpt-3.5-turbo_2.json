However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about understanding the value of all individuals in God's kingdom. While it acknowledges the importance of individuals regardless of physical state, it does not explicitly tie this back to a Christian worldview, such as emphasizing God's ability to use anyone for His purposes and plans. To improve, the response could have integrated more explicitly Christian perspectives on how God values and uses individuals, even those society may marginalize or overlook."
