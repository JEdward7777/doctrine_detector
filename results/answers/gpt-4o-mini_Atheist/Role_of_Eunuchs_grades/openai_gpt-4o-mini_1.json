However, it falls short in fully integrating the Christian worldview by not explicitly connecting the roles of eunuchs in ancient societies to God's sovereignty and divine plan. The response could have delved deeper into how God's sovereignty and purpose are manifested through the roles of eunuchs, emphasizing the idea that God can use anyone for His plans, even those who may be marginalized or overlooked in society."
