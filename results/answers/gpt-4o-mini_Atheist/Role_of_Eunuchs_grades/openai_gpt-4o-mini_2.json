While the perspective presented aligns with valuing individuals irrespective of physical or social status, it lacks a direct reference to God's specific plans and purposes for all individuals in His kingdom. Integrating a clearer connection to God's sovereignty and purpose for all individuals, including eunuchs, within the Christian worldview would strengthen the response further."
