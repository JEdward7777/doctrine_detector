It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how Jesus fulfills the prophecy of ruling God's kingdom with righteousness. The integration of scriptural references and theological insights demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian beliefs and teachings. One suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the unique and sacrificial nature of Jesus' role as the Messiah in fulfilling God's plan for humanity, highlighting the redemptive aspect of his sacrifice on the cross."
