It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting Jesus' divine nature and role in revealing God, emphasizing key theological concepts such as the Incarnation, creative authority, and salvific role. The connection between Jesus' divinity, revelation of God, and his central role in salvation is well-explored and explained in a clear and coherent manner. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively showcases the deep theological implications of Jesus being called \"the Word of God.\""
