  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that effectively outlines various key roles of Jesus in salvation based on relevant Bible verses. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of Jesus in Christian doctrine. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of conciseness and focus, which is why a slightly lower grade is assigned."
