## [Answer](../Role_of_Jesus.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible presents Jesus as central to the theme of salvation in several key ways. Christian doctrine, drawing from various New Testament texts, articulates these roles:

1. **Savior**: Jesus is often referred to as the Savior of humanity. John 3:16 emphasizes that God sent His Son so that believers might have eternal life. This illustrates the belief that through Jesus’ sacrifice, salvation is available to all who have faith.

2. **Mediator**: In 1 Timothy 2:5, Jesus is described as the mediator between God and humanity. This suggests that through Him, believers can have a relationship with God, emphasizing the need for a mediator to bridge the gap caused by sin.

3. **Redeemer**: According to passages like Galatians 3:13 and Ephesians 1:7, Jesus' death and resurrection are seen as acts of redemption. This means He paid the price for sin, delivering believers from the consequences of sin and bringing them into a right relationship with God.

4. **The Way, the Truth, and the Life**: In John 14:6, Jesus identifies Himself as "the way, the truth, and the life." This asserts that access to God and eternal life comes solely through Him, positioning faith in Jesus as essential for salvation.

5. **Model of Faith and Obedience**: Jesus is also portrayed as the perfect example of obedience to God’s will. His teachings and actions are seen as the model for how believers should live, reflecting a commitment to a faith that is both personal and communal.

These roles collectively outline a view of Jesus as essential for salvation, highlighting themes of grace, faith, and personal relationship with God. It's important to note that interpretations can vary widely among different denominations and theological traditions.
