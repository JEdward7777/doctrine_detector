Each role is supported by relevant biblical references, demonstrating a strong understanding of why clarifying Jesus' role is crucial for comprehending the Christian faith and the nature of redemption. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the unique and exclusive nature of Jesus as the only way to salvation even more explicitly, but overall, this is an excellent and well-rounded response."
