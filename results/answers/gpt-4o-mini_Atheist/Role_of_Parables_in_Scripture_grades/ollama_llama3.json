  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise explanation of Nathan's use of parable to confront King David, highlighting the effectiveness of the method in leading to David's recognition and repentance. The writer effectively breaks down the story, identifying its multiple purposes and how it engaged David's emotions and moral sensibilities. Additionally, they provide relevant biblical context (2 Samuel 12:1-14) and highlight the power of storytelling in moral persuasion.\n\nThe response also aligns well with the concern about understanding the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, providing specific examples and analysis from Scripture.\n\nTo reach a higher grade, the response could benefit from more nuanced analysis of Nathan's motivations and goals, as well as more explicit connections to broader biblical themes or theological concepts. However, overall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic."
