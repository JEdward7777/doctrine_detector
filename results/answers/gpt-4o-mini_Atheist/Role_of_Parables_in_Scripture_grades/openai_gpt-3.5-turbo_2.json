The integration of biblical narrative and analysis demonstrated a strong understanding of the use of parables for correction and revelation in the context of the story of Nathan and David. This response aligned well with a Christian worldview by highlighting the power of storytelling to engage emotions and moral sensibilities in order to lead to acknowledgment and repentance."
