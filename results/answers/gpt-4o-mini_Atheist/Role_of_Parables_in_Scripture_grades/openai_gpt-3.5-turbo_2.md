## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The prophet Nathan employed a parable as a clever and indirect means of confronting King David about his actions regarding Bathsheba and Uriah. This encounter is described in 2 Samuel 12:1-14. 

Nathan approached David with a story about two men, one wealthy and one poor. The rich man had many sheep, while the poor man owned only one lamb, which he cherished dearly. When a traveler visited the rich man, instead of slaughtering one of his own sheep, the rich man took the poor man's lamb to serve his guest. 

This parable served multiple purposes. It engaged David’s emotions and moral sensibilities without confronting him directly at first. When David, outraged by the injustice in the story, declared that the rich man deserved to die and should repay fourfold, Nathan revealed the story's true purpose by stating, "You are the man!" This pivot brought David face to face with the reality of his sins—adultery with Bathsheba and the arranged death of Uriah.

Through the parable, Nathan effectively highlighted David's moral failure in a way that would resonate with David’s own sense of justice, ultimately leading to a moment of recognition and repentance. This method illustrates the power of storytelling in moral persuasion, especially in a cultural context where direct confrontation could have been dangerous or met with hostility.
