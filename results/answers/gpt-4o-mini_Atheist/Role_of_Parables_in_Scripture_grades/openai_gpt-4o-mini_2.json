  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how Nathan's use of a parable effectively confronted King David about his sins. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical narrative and the purpose of using parables in delivering messages of correction and revelation. The response effectively connects the use of parables in biblical contexts to the broader theme of moral persuasion and the importance of engaging with individuals on a personal and emotional level. Well done!"
