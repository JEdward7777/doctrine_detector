  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer detailing the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament. They accurately highlighted the various duties such as offering sacrifices, performing rituals, teaching the law, maintaining the sanctuary, and serving as intermediaries between God and the people. The inclusion of divination practices and the role of Levitical priests showed an in-depth understanding of the subject. However, there was some additional information beyond the reference answer, leading to a slightly lower grade."
