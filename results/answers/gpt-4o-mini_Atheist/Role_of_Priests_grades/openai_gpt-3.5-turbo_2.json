However, it lacks specific details on the intricacies of priestly duties such as maintaining the sanctuary, acting as intermediaries, and divination practices like consulting the Urim and Thummim, which are essential aspects of understanding the full biblical role of priests. Incorporating these additional details would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
