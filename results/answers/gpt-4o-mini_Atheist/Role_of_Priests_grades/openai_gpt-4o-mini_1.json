The mention of offering sacrifices, prayers, performing rituals, pronouncing blessings, and teaching God's laws is accurate but could have been enriched with specific references to the types of sacrifices, rituals, and laws involved. Additionally, incorporating the intermediary role of priests and their duties in maintaining the sanctuary would have further enhanced the understanding of their biblical role."
