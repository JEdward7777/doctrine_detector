  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of the role of a prophet in the Bible, they went beyond the specific concern of understanding the biblical role of prophets and their messages. The student included additional details about how prophets serve as mediators, interpret events, challenge the status quo, and foretell future events, which, while accurate, was not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer provided. However, the student did capture key elements such as prophets speaking God's messages, warning people to turn from sin, guiding towards a relationship with God, and emphasizing moral and spiritual integrity. Thus, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical role of prophets overall."
