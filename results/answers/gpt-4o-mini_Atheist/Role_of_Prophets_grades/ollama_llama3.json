  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nWhile the response provides a good overview of the prophet's role in communicating God's messages, it could be more detailed and nuanced. The initial statement that \"the primary role of a prophet is to speak God's messages to the people\" is a good starting point, but the response could have explored this idea further by highlighting the various ways prophets communicated with God (e.g., receiving divine revelations) and the types of messages they conveyed (e.g., warnings, guidance, encouragement).\n\nThe mention of warning people to turn away from their sins and obey God is also an important aspect of a prophet's role, but it would have been helpful to see more development on this point. For example, how did prophets go about calling for repentance and justice? What were some key examples or biblical stories that demonstrated this?\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical role of prophets, but could benefit from further elaboration and specific examples."
