  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the relationship between repentance and forgiveness in the Bible. They have correctly defined both terms and supported their points with relevant scripture references from both the Old and New Testaments. Additionally, they have highlighted the mutual relationship between repentance and forgiveness, as well as provided insight into broader teachings on the subject. The only area for improvement could be to further emphasize the centrality of Christ's atonement in the process of repentance and forgiveness in the New Testament context."
