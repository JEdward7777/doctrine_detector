## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Sadducees were a prominent Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, and they played a crucial role in the religious and political life of Judea. Their main responsibilities within the Jewish temple system included:

1. **Temple Administration**: The Sadducees were heavily involved in the administration of the Temple in Jerusalem. They managed the daily operations, which included overseeing sacrifices, ensuring proper rituals were conducted, and maintaining the sanctity of the Temple.

2. **Sacrificial System**: They were primarily responsible for the sacrificial offerings in the Temple, which were central to Jewish worship. This included organizing and supervising the offerings, as well as ensuring that the sacrifices were performed according to Jewish law.

3. **Interpretation of the Law**: As a priestly group, the Sadducees held significant influence over the interpretation of Jewish law, particularly those laws pertaining to the Temple and priestly duties. They were known for their strict adherence to the written Torah and often clashed with the Pharisees over interpretations of the law.

4. **Political Influence**: Many Sadducees were part of the priestly aristocracy and held positions of power, which enabled them to influence the political landscape of Judea. They often collaborated with Roman authorities, which sometimes created tension with other Jewish groups.

5. **Judicial Authority**: The Sadducees had a role in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish council that governed legal matters and disputes. Their influence in the council allowed them to shape judicial rulings, especially those related to Temple practices.

6. **Representation of the Temple**: The Sadducees acted as representatives of the Temple and its interests in wider society, often engaging in diplomatic and political negotiations with external authorities, including the Romans.

Overall, the Sadducees were integral to the functioning of the Second Temple, balancing their religious responsibilities with the political realities of the time. Their decline came after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, as their authority and practices were deeply tied to the existence of the Temple.
