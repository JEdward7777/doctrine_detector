They effectively utilized examples from Jesus' teachings, the Apostles' actions, and specific biblical passages to support their points. However, the response could have been more concise and directly addressed the concern by emphasizing the integration of Scripture in the communication of the Gospel, which is slightly lacking in clarity throughout the answer."
