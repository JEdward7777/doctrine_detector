  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of highlighting the importance of witnesses in the New Testament, particularly in relation to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. The author provides specific examples from the Gospels and other New Testament texts to support their claims, which adds credibility to their argument. The response also explores the role of witnesses beyond just recounting historical events, noting how they shape faith formation and counteract skepticism.\n\nThe only area where this response falls short is in its brevity. While the author provides a solid foundation for their argument, they could have expanded on some of the points to provide more depth and nuance. Additionally, the response does not explicitly tie the concept of witnesses back to the original concern about witnessing one's faith and sharing personal experiences with God.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively demonstrates an understanding of the role of witnesses in the New Testament. With some further development and connection to the original concern, it could be even stronger."
