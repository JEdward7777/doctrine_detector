  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed examination of the role of witnesses in the New Testament, discussing their importance in establishing the events of Jesus' life and resurrection. The explanation is well-supported with specific examples and references from Scripture. However, the response could have further emphasized the personal aspect of witnessing faith and the call for Christians to share their own experiences of God's work in their lives, in line with the concern provided. Integrating this aspect more explicitly would have strengthened the overall analysis and connected the discussion more closely to the concern presented."
