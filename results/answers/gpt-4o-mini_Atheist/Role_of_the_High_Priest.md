## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In ancient Israel, the high priest (Kohen Gadol) held a unique and elevated position compared to other priests (Kohanim). Here are some of the distinctive responsibilities and roles associated with the high priest:

1. **Unique Duties on Yom Kippur**: The high priest had specific responsibilities during the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). He performed the ceremonial scapegoat rite, where he symbolically transferred the sins of the people onto a goat, which was then sent into the wilderness. He also entered the Holy of Holies, the most sacred space in the Tabernacle (and later the Temple), to make atonement for himself and the people.

2. **Application of the Urim and Thummim**: The high priest was responsible for the use of the Urim and Thummim, which were used for divination or determining God's will in important matters. This placed the high priest in a vital role in guiding the nation based on divine insight.

3. **Consecration and Anointing**: The high priest was anointed with sacred oil, marking him as set apart for his duties. This anointing was a symbol of his authority and special status, distinguishing him from other priests.

4. **Leadership Role**: The high priest served as the spiritual leader of the Israelite community, overseeing the other priests and ensuring that worship and sacrificial practices were conducted according to the Mosaic Law.

5. **Responsibility for the Sanctuary**: The high priest had the primary responsibility for the Tabernacle or Temple, including its maintenance and the observance of the rituals and sacrifices performed therein. He was a key figure in maintaining the sanctity of the worship space.

6. **Crisis Management**: In times of national crisis, such as during war or famine, the high priest often took on an advisory role, providing spiritual guidance and making intercessory prayers on behalf of the nation.

7. **Representation before God**: The high priest acted as the intermediary between God and the people, offering sacrifices and prayers to seek God's favor and forgiveness on behalf of the Israelites, a role with greater importance compared to the other priests.

The high priest's combination of these responsibilities highlights a profound level of spiritual authority and obligation that set him apart within the priestly system in ancient Israel.
