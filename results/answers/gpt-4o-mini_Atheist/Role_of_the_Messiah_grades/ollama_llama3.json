It also mentions that Jesus would start the New Covenant with his people, which is a significant aspect of His mission. However, the response lacks depth and detail in its discussion of the Messiah's roles and their significance for understanding Jesus' mission and authority.\n\nWhile it provides some general information about the Messiah's roles, it does not fully engage with the concern about clarity on the role of the Messiah helping believers comprehend Jesus' mission and authority. The response could be improved by providing more specific examples and illustrations from Scripture to support its claims, as well as exploring how each of the Messiah's roles contributes to a broader understanding of Jesus' purpose and message."
