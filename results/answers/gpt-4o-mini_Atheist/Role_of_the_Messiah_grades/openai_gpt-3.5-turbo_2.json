It correctly emphasizes the roles of prophet, priest, and king, aligning with biblical teachings. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting these roles to Jesus's mission and authority, thereby enhancing clarity for believers in understanding the significance of Jesus in fulfilling these roles."
