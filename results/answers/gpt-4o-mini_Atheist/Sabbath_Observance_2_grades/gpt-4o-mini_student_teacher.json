  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of how God instructed the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath. They accurately explained the significance of collecting a double portion on the sixth day to ensure provisions for the Sabbath and highlighted the importance of rest and trust in God's provision. The student effectively connected the practice of gathering manna to the observance of the Sabbath according to God's commands. The only improvement could be providing a more concise and direct response that closely mirrors the reference answer."
