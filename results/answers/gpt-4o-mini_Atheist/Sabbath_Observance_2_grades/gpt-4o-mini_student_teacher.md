## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the biblical narrative found in the book of Exodus, God instructed the Israelites on how to gather manna, particularly in relation to the Sabbath, to ensure that they would not have to collect it on that holy day. According to Exodus 16:22-30, the Israelites were to gather manna daily, but on the sixth day, they were commanded to collect a double portion. This provision was so that they would have enough food for the Sabbath, during which no manna would be available. 

The instructions emphasized rest on the Sabbath, reflecting its significance as a day of worship and cessation from labor. Consequently, the Israelites were to trust in God's provision and prepare in advance by gathering extra manna on Friday, which would remain fresh for their use on the Sabbath. This practice not only highlighted the importance of the Sabbath but also reinforced the community's reliance on divine sustenance.
