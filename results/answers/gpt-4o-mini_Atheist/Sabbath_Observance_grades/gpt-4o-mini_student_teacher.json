  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful answer regarding the significance of keeping the Sabbath holy, including cultural, religious, and practical implications. While the response contained valuable information, it deviated slightly from the reference answer by adding extra details beyond the scope of the question, such as cultural identity and community practices. The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the Sabbath's importance but could have focused more directly on the core concept of refraining from work and worshiping God as commanded."
