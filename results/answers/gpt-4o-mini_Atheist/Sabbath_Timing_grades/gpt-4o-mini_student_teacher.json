  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the timing of the Sabbath according to Jewish tradition, aligning well with the reference answer. The student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical teaching regarding the observance of the Sabbath. However, deducting a few points for the slight overemphasis on the specific timing variations based on geographic locations and the time of year, which are not directly tied to the Biblical teaching on when the Sabbath begins and ends. Overall, a strong and well-informed answer."
