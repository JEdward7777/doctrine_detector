## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In Jewish tradition, the Sabbath, known as Shabbat, begins at sunset on Friday and ends at nightfall on Saturday. The timing is based on the biblical creation narrative, where it is said that God rested on the seventh day. The traditional approach is to light candles 18 minutes before sunset on Friday to welcome the Sabbath, and the conclusion is marked by the Havdalah ceremony after the stars are visible on Saturday evening. The specific timings can vary depending on geographic location and the time of year, as they are determined by local sunset times.
