  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of what it means to love sacrificially as demonstrated by Jesus, they slightly missed the mark on connecting this concept to the essence of God's love and how it should reflect in personal relationships. The student's answer focused more on the actions and characteristics involved in sacrificial love, which is essential but could have been strengthened by explicitly linking it back to God's sacrificial love and how that should shape our relationships with others. Encouraging the student to deepen their analysis by explicitly referencing God's ultimate sacrifice through Jesus could enhance the alignment with the Christian worldview."
