  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the differences between Sadducean beliefs and Christian teaching regarding the resurrection. The response is well-written, providing concise explanations and drawing relevant comparisons between the two perspectives. The student clearly articulates the Sadducees' denial of resurrection based on their interpretation of the Torah, and contrasts it with Christian belief in Jesus' resurrection as central to their faith."
