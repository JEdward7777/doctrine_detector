The student demonstrates a good understanding of the key elements of the vow and how they manifest in Samson's narrative. The analysis of divine purpose, consequences of breaking vows, God's redemption, and cultural identity is well articulated and supported by textual examples. To improve, the student could include more direct scriptural references to bolster their points and further tie their analysis to the biblical text. Overall, a solid examination of the topic."
