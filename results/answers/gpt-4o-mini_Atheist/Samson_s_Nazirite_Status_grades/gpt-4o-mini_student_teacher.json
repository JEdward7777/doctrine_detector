The explanation of how Samson's strength was directly tied to his adherence to the Nazirite vow was well articulated. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the teacher's reference answer, which emphasized the direct link between Samson's strength and his uncut hair as a manifestation of the power and significance of the Nazirite vow in his life. Additionally, incorporating more direct biblical references and deeper analysis of the biblical text could have further strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
