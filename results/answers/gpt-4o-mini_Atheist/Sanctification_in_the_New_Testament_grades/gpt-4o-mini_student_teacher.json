  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student a grade of 80. The student gave a thorough and well-explained answer that covers important aspects of the sanctification process as described in the New Testament. However, the concern specifically mentioned recognizing the role of faith in the sanctification process, which was not explicitly highlighted in the student's response. While the student did touch on the importance of faith in Christ, they could have delved deeper into how faith plays a central role in the sanctification process according to the Christian worldview. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic but could have directly addressed the specified concern more explicitly."
