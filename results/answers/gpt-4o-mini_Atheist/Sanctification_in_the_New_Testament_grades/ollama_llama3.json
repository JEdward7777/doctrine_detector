  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of recognizing the role of faith in the process of sanctification, as instructed by the concern. The text explicitly mentions \"faith in Christ\" as one aspect of the sanctification process and even highlights the importance of obedience to God's Word, which is rooted in faith. Additionally, the passage notes that positional sanctification occurs at the moment of belief when a person is set apart as holy through faith in Jesus.\n\nHowever, to earn a higher grade, I would have liked to see more explicit emphasis on the role of faith throughout the process, rather than just mentioning it initially. While the text does acknowledge the ongoing process of becoming more like Christ, it could be strengthened by further highlighting how faith plays out in that process.\n\nOverall, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding sanctification and recognizes the crucial importance of faith in the process. With some additional development on this point, it could even reach a higher grade."
