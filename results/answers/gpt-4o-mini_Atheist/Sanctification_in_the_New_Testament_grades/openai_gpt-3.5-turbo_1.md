# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The New Testament presents the sanctification process for believers in Jesus as a journey of spiritual growth and transformation that occurs through the work of the Holy Spirit, faith in Christ, and obedience to God's Word. Here are some key aspects of how sanctification is described:

1. **Position and Process**: Sanctification is both a positional and a progressive transformation. Positional sanctification occurs at the moment of belief when a person is set apart as holy through faith in Jesus (1 Corinthians 1:30). Progressive sanctification refers to the ongoing process of becoming more like Christ throughout a believer's life (Philippians 2:12-13).

2. **Role of the Holy Spirit**: The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in sanctification. Believers are said to be indwelt by the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:9), who empowers them to live in accordance with God's will. The Spirit convicts believers of sin, guides them in righteousness, and helps them bear the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).

3. **Obedience to Godâ€™s Word**: The New Testament emphasizes the importance of obedience to the teachings of Jesus and the apostles as part of the sanctification process. Jesus said that those who love Him will keep His commandments (John 14:15). The Word of God is described as a tool for sanctification, as seen in John 17:17, where Jesus prays, "Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth."

4. **Community and Fellowship**: Believers are encouraged to participate in community and fellowship with other Christians to support each other in the sanctification process (Hebrews 10:24-25). The church plays a role in teaching, accountability, and encouragement.

5. **Suffering and Trials**: The New Testament teaches that suffering and trials can be used by God to refine believers and help them grow in their faith (James 1:2-4; Romans 5:3-5). These experiences are seen as opportunities for growth and deeper reliance on God.

6. **Goal of Sanctification**: Ultimately, the goal of sanctification is to be conformed to the image of Christ (Romans 8:29) and to live a life that reflects His character and love. The process will be completed when believers are glorified in the presence of God in eternity (1 John 3:2).

In summary, sanctification is portrayed in the New Testament as a dynamic and multifaceted process involving the work of the Holy Spirit, engagement with Scripture, community support, and the transformative power of God in a believer's life.
