## [Answer](../Sanctuary_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the context of the Bible, the term 'sanctuary' generally refers to a sacred or holy place set aside for worship and the presence of God. In the Old Testament, particularly within the context of the Israelite religion, the sanctuary was associated with the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem. 

1. **Tabernacle**: In Exodus, the Tabernacle is described as a mobile dwelling place for God among the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness. It included areas such as the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place (or Holy of Holies), where the Ark of the Covenant was located. 

2. **Temple**: After settling in the Promised Land, Solomon built a more permanent structure, the First Temple in Jerusalem, which served a similar purpose as the Tabernacle. The Temple also had areas designated for worship, rituals, and sacrifices.

The 'sanctuary' also signifies a place of refuge and protection, and various biblical texts illustrate the themes of protection and sacredness surrounding such spaces.

In summary, the term 'sanctuary' in biblical context encompasses both the physical spaces designated for divine worship and the concept of a holy presence where the faithful could encounter God.
