In the Old Testament, God describes the sanctuary as a crucial place of worship and divine presence among His people, the Israelites. The sanctuary, specifically the Tabernacle in the wilderness and later the Temple in Jerusalem, symbolizes the relationship between God and His people. 

Key aspects include:

1. **Divine Presence**: The sanctuary is often referred to as the dwelling place of God. In Exodus 25:8, God instructs the Israelites to build a sanctuary so that He may dwell among them. This indicates a close relationship, where God wants to be in the midst of His people.

2. **Holiness**: The sanctuary is characterized by its holiness. In Leviticus 10:3, God emphasizes that He must be regarded as holy in the sanctuary. This underscores the idea that approaching God requires reverence and purity.

3. **Place of Worship**: The sanctuary serves as a focal point for worship and sacrifices. In Exodus 29:42-43, the sanctuary is described as the place where offerings are made, and where God meets with His people.

4. **Covenant Relationship**: The sanctuary is tied to the covenant between God and Israel. In the context of worship, rituals, and sacrifices performed there, it is a constant reminder of their covenant obligations and Godâ€™s promises.

5. **Symbol of Restoration and Hope**: The sanctuary also represents a place of restoration and community focus. It is where sins are atoned for, reflecting God's mercy and the hope for reconciliation.

In summary, the sanctuary in the Old Testament is a profound symbol of God's desire to be present with His people, embodying themes of holiness, worship, covenant, and restoration.
