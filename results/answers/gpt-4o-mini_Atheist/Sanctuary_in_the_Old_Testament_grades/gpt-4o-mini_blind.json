The inclusion of key aspects such as divine presence, holiness, worship, covenant relationship, and the symbol of restoration and hope shows a thorough grasp of the theological implications of the sanctuary. The explanation is clear, supported by relevant Bible verses, and reflects a deep appreciation for the sanctity of the sanctuary in the Old Testament context. Great job overall!"
