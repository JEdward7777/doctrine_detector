  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the sanctuary in the Old Testament, addressing its role in worship, divine presence, holiness, covenant relationship, and hope for restoration. However, the student could have emphasized more on God's description of the sanctuary as a dwelling place and a source of safety for His people, as indicated in the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the concepts related to the sanctuary in relation to God and His people."
