It also touches on the theme of safety and protection. However, the response lacks depth and nuance in its exploration of the sanctuary's significance. For instance, it does not explicitly mention the themes of holiness, worship, covenant relationship, or restoration, which are crucial aspects of the sanctuary's purpose.\n\nThe response mostly focuses on God's presence and the Israelites' need for protection, while the provided answer only scratches the surface of the sanctuary's meaning. To improve this response, it would be beneficial to incorporate more specific details from the Old Testament and provide a clearer connection between the sanctuary and its broader implications for the relationship between God and His people."
