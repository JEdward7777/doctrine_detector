  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided an excellent response highlighting key Bible verses related to the practice of interceding for others. The verses chosen effectively convey the importance and impact of intercessory prayer. Additionally, the student's explanation of each verse demonstrates a clear understanding of the theme. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to include some of the verses from the reference answer provided by the teacher to offer a more comprehensive exploration of the topic. Overall, a strong effort in integrating Scripture into the discussion of intercession."
