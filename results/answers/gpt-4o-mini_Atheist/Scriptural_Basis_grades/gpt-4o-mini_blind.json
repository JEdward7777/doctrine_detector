  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-structured and thorough answer supported by relevant Bible verses that strongly uphold the concept of propitiation in Christian theology. The references to key verses such as Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2, and 1 John 4:10 clearly demonstrate an understanding of the doctrine. The inclusion of Hebrews 2:17 and Leviticus 16:15-16 further enriches the explanation by providing additional biblical contexts. The student's response is doctrinally sound and effectively conveys the significance of propitiation in Christian belief."
