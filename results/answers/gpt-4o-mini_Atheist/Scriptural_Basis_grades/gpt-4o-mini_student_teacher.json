The inclusion of additional verses such as Hebrews 2:17 and Leviticus 16:15-16 demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specified concern of connecting the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding, rather than briefly mentioning that interpretations may vary."
