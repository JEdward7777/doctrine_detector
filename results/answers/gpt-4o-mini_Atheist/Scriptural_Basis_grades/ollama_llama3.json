  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides an excellent example of connecting the theological concept of propitiation to biblical references for deeper understanding. It presents multiple verses from different books of the Bible, including Romans, 1 John, and Hebrews, which all emphasize Jesus' sacrifice as an act of propitiation. The inclusion of Leviticus 16:15-16 also provides a helpful historical context for understanding the concept of atonement. While it's true that key verses are highlighted (1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26), it would be even more effective to provide a brief explanation or analysis of how these verses illustrate the concept of propitiation. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological concept and its biblical roots, earning a high grade."
