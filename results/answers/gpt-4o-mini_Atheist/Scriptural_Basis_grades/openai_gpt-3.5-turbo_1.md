## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of propitiation, which generally refers to the act of appeasing or satisfying the wrath of a deity, is prevalent in Christian theology, particularly in the context of Jesus’ sacrifice for humanity's sins. Here are several Bible verses that are often cited to support this concept:

1. **Romans 3:25**: "Whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins."

2. **1 John 2:2**: "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world."

3. **1 John 4:10**: "In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins."

4. **Hebrews 2:17**: "Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."

5. **Leviticus 16:15-16**: This passage discusses the Day of Atonement and how the high priest makes atonement for the sins of the people, which can be understood in light of the broader concept of propitiation.

These verses illustrate the theological interpretation of Jesus' sacrifice as an act that appeases God's wrath, thereby restoring the relationship between humanity and the divine. As with any theological concept, interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and scholars.
