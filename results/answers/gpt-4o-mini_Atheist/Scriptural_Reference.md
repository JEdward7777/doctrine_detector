## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of the 'world' in relation to believers is addressed in several passages in the Bible, with varying implications. Here are some key verses that reflect this theme:

1. **John 15:18-19**: In this passage, Jesus tells His disciples that if the world hates them, they should remember that it hated Him first. It emphasizes the idea that believers are distinct from the world and may face opposition because of their faith.

2. **Romans 12:2**: Paul encourages Christians not to conform to the patterns of this world, but to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. This indicates a call for believers to live differently from societal norms.

3. **1 John 2:15-17**: This passage warns believers against loving the world or the things in it, stating that love for the Father cannot coexist with love for the world. It underscores the transient nature of worldly desires.

4. **James 4:4**: James states that friendship with the world is enmity against God, suggesting that aligning oneself with worldly values can lead to spiritual separation from God.

5. **Matthew 28:19-20**: In the Great Commission, Jesus instructs His followers to make disciples of all nations. This implies an engagement with the world, leading others towards a relationship with God while maintaining their distinct identity as believers.

6. **Philippians 3:20**: Paul writes that believers' citizenship is in heaven, which indicates a distinction from earthly existence and the priorities of the world.

7. **Colossians 3:2**: Paul advises believers to set their minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, reinforcing the idea of looking beyond the immediate concerns of the world.

These passages collectively highlight a theme of tension between believers and the world, encapsulating calls for distinctiveness while also encouraging engagement and transformation in light of their faith.
