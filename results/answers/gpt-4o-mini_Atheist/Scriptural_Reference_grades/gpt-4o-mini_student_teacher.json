  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful overview of biblical passages addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers. They referenced relevant verses and explained their implications well. However, the student missed including the specific key passages mentioned in the teacher's reference answer, which could have strengthened their response. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic but could have aligned more closely with the given concern."
