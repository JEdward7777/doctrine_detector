  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern of navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values, providing scriptural support for distinctiveness from the world while also highlighting the importance of engagement and transformation. The selection of passages is relevant to the concern, and the commentary on each passage is thoughtful and concise.\n\nHowever, I would have liked to see more depth and analysis of the implications of these passages for everyday life as a believer. Additionally, while the response provides some insight into the tension between believers and the world, it could benefit from further exploration of this theme and its practical applications.\n\nOverall, the response is well-organized, easy to follow, and provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical perspective on navigating life in a world with ungodly values."
