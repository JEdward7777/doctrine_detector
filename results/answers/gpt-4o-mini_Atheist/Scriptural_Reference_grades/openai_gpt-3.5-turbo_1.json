  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of key Bible passages addressing believers' relationship with the world and how to navigate life amidst ungodly values. The additional verses and explanations given demonstrate a well-rounded understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The grade is slightly reduced due to not directly addressing the specific passages provided in the initial answer, but overall, the response is insightful and reflective of a Christian perspective on this concern."
