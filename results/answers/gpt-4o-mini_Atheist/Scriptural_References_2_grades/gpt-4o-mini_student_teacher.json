  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of biblical passages supporting the concept of the Day of Judgment, referencing both Old and New Testament verses. The student's answer shows a strong understanding of the scriptural basis for the belief in judgment, and effectively reinforces the importance of studying and understanding these passages in relation to theological discussions. The only minor deduction is for not including the specific passages mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a well-substantiated and well-structured response."
