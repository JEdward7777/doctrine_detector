## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of the Day of Judgment is referenced in several biblical passages across both the Old and New Testaments. Here are some key verses that support this idea:

1. **Matthew 25:31-46**: This passage describes the separation of the righteous and the unrighteous at the final judgment, often referred to as the "Sheep and the Goats" parable.

2. **Revelation 20:11-15**: In this passage, the "Great White Throne Judgment" is depicted. It speaks of the dead being judged according to their deeds, emphasizing the accountability of individuals.

3. **Romans 14:10-12**: This verse highlights that all will stand before God's judgment seat and gives the idea that everyone will give an account of themselves to God.

4. **2 Corinthians 5:10**: Here, Paul states that we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ to receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.

5. **Ecclesiastes 12:14**: This Old Testament verse notes that God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.

6. **Hebrews 9:27**: This passage asserts that it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, reinforcing the inevitability of the Day of Judgment.

7. **Matthew 12:36-37**: Jesus teaches that people will give account for every careless word they speak, indicating the scrutiny of judgment.

These passages reflect a consistent theme throughout the Bible regarding the final judgment and accountability for oneâ€™s actions. They are often cited in theological discussions surrounding eschatology, the study of end times and judgment.
