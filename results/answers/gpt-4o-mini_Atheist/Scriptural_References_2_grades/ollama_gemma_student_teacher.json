  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical passages related to the Day of Judgment. They provide a concise and well-organized list of relevant verses from both the Old and New Testaments. The inclusion of contextual information about eschatology adds depth to the response. \n\nHowever, the student's answer could benefit from including more analysis or interpretation of the passages beyond simply listing them. Including some reflection on the significance of these passages in Christian theology or their theological implications would elevate the quality of the response."
