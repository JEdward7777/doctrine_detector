  "grade_comment": "Grade: 88\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and detailed explanation of key biblical passages relating to the Day of Judgment, supporting the scriptural basis for beliefs. However, it does not directly address the specific passages mentioned in the given answer, which would have strengthened the coherence and relevance to the concern. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is displayed with a clear connection to Christian beliefs about judgment."
