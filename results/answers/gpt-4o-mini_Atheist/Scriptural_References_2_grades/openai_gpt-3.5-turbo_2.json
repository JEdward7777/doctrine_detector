It effectively connects the verses to the concept of the Day of Judgment and emphasizes the accountability of individuals before God. The inclusion of various passages from both the Old and New Testaments demonstrates a well-rounded perspective on this important theological topic. Great job in addressing the concern and providing a solid biblical foundation for the discussion on judgment."
