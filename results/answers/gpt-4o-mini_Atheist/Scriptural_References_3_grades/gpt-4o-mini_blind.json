The focus on the duality of appearance and reality, hypocrisy, judgment, accountability, and spiritual deterioration is well-supported by the text. The explanation is clear, detailed, and demonstrates a solid understanding of the passage and its implications for understanding iniquity in light of Christian teachings. Great job overall!"
