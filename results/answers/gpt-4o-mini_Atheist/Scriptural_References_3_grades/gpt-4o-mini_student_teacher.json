  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student effectively analyzed the passage from Matthew 23:27-28, drawing out key insights on the nature of iniquity such as the duality of appearance and reality, hypocrisy, judgment and accountability, and spiritual deterioration. They provided detailed explanations supported by the text, demonstrating a deep understanding of the passage. However, the student's answer was slightly longer and more detailed than the reference answer, which may have diluted the focus on the central theme of integrity in one's faith. Overall, the student's response was thorough, insightful, and well-written."
