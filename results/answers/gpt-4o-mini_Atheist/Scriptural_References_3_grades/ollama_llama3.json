  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 92.\n\nThis response effectively captures the essence of Matthew 23:27-28, highlighting the tension between outward appearance and inner reality. The writer provides clear and concise explanations for each point, drawing out key insights about the nature of iniquity. The language is precise, and the biblical references are accurate.\n\nThe only area where this response could be improved is in its depth and nuance. While it accurately conveys the main ideas, it could delve deeper into the implications and applications of these passages for Christian living. For example, the writer could explore how Christians can avoid falling prey to outward appearances and instead pursue genuine holiness.\n\nThe concern that this passage addresses - pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards - is well-handled in this response. The writer's summary effectively conveys the main point of the passage: that true righteousness comes from the heart, not just external actions or appearances.\n\nOverall, this is a strong and thoughtful response that demonstrates a good understanding of Matthew 23:27-28 and its relevance to Christian living."
