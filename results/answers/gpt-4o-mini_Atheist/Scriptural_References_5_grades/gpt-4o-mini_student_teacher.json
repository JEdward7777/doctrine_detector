  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation supported by relevant verses from the New Testament that indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades. They effectively analyzed each passage and highlighted the transition from viewing Hades as a neutral place to associating it with the unrighteous. While their answer is detailed and well-researched, they could have focused more on directly comparing and contrasting the references given in the teacher's answer, which might have strengthened their argument further."
