  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place to a location associated with judgment. The student provides relevant and well-chosen New Testament passages to support their claims. However, the response would benefit from a more explicit connection between the verses cited and the specific concern related to expanding knowledge of Hades' nature and its implications for Christian eschatology."
