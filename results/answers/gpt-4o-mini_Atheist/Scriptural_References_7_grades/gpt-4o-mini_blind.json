  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the concept of exaltation in the Christian faith as illustrated in 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11. The student effectively highlights the importance of humility and submission to God in the process of exaltation. The response could have been strengthened by adding more direct references to the verses and explicitly connecting them to the concept of exaltation. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound explanation."
