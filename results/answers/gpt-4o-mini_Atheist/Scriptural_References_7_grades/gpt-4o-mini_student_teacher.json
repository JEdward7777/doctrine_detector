  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and detailed explanation connecting the biblical principles of humility and exaltation in the context of 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11. They effectively elaborated on how humility is intertwined with exaltation in these passages and highlighted the significance of embodying Christ-like characteristics. However, the student's response could have been strengthened by aligning more closely with the concise reference answer provided by the teacher."
