  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response in exploring different scriptural references supporting the concept of being blameless and how they can guide a Christian's life. The analysis of each reference and its implications was well-done, showcasing a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective. The student effectively connected the verses to practical guidance for living a blameless life. However, the student could have included the teacher's key references in their response to align more closely with the specified concern. Great job overall!"
