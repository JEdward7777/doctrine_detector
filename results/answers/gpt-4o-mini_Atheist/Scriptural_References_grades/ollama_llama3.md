## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham is found in the book of Genesis. Specifically, in Genesis 17:1, God introduces Himself to Abraham as "El Shaddai," which is often translated as "God Almighty." This chapter details the covenant between God and Abraham, marking a significant moment in the biblical narrative.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

The response accurately identifies the reference to God as "Almighty" in Genesis 17:1, which meets the minimum requirement. It also provides some context about the significance of this passage, noting that it marks a covenant between God and Abraham, which adds some depth to the answer.

However, I would deduct points because the response does not explicitly state how knowing this biblical reference helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises, which was the concern. While the response mentions the book of Genesis being important in the biblical narrative, it does not specifically explain how this reference relates to deepening our connection with God.

Overall, the response is a good start, but could be improved by explicitly addressing the concern and providing more insight into how knowing this reference can help us connect with Scripture and God's promises.
