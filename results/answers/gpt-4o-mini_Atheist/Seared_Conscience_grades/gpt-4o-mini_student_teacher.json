  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained answer on the concept of a 'seared' conscience and its implications for a believer. However, the answer delved more into the broader implications rather than focusing on the core meaning of a 'seared' conscience as indicated in the reference answer. It would have been stronger if the explanation highlighted more on how a 'seared' conscience reflects insensitivity to sin and the lack of guilt."
