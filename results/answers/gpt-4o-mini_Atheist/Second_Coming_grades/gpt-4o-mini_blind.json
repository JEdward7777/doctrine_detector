  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and coherent explanation of the theological implications of Jesus' statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds for believers. The answer is well-supported with references to relevant scriptures and effectively conveys the eschatological hope, recognition of divine authority, call to vigilance, and community and assurance aspects of this belief. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and effectively articulates the implications from a Christian worldview. Great job overall."
