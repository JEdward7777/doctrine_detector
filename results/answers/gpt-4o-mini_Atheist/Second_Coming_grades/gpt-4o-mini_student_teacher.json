  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful analysis of the implications of Jesus' statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds for believers. They have effectively highlighted the themes of eschatological hope, recognition of divine authority, call to vigilance, and community assurance. However, there is room for improvement in aligning their response more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, particularly in emphasizing Jesus' return as the Messiah and the fulfillment of God's promises. Overall, a strong effort with valuable insights."
