  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response addresses the concern by discussing the implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' for Christian hope and eschatology, exploring themes such as hope, divine authority, and eschatological expectations. The response provides specific biblical references (Matthew 24:30 and Mark 13:26) and offers a nuanced understanding of the significance of this statement in various aspects of Christian life.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have delved deeper into the theological nuances of Jesus' second coming, exploring more specific examples or contrasting views within different denominations. Additionally, while the response does an excellent job of highlighting the implications for Christian hope and eschatology, it could have further developed this connection by discussing how these themes relate to other key aspects of Christian theology.\n\nOverall, the response provides a strong foundation for understanding the significance of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man', and with some additional development, could have achieved a score closer to 100."
