  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 85. \n\nThe student has provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the Pharisees' concerns about separating the Jewish people from Gentiles, covering various aspects such as religious identity, cultural integrity, historical context, ritual purity, and social cohesion. The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the Pharisees' motivations and the broader implications of their actions. \n\nThe only reason for not achieving a perfect score is due to slightly exceeding the scope of the concern given. While the student's answer provides valuable insights into the Pharisees' reasons for their concerns, the core focus of maintaining religious purity and adherence to Jewish laws and traditions could have been emphasized more clearly. \n\nOverall, the student has shown critical thinking and knowledge of the topic, earning a high grade for their response."
