  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the ways Christians can serve God in ministry, referencing relevant biblical principles and practical examples. The response covers essential aspects of Christian ministry, including outreach, service, teaching, and social justice. The clarity and coherence of the answer are commendable. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher is more specific in its suggestions, focusing on teaching, caring for the sick, and providing food for the poor. The student's answer offers a broader range of options, which slightly exceeds the teacher's response."
