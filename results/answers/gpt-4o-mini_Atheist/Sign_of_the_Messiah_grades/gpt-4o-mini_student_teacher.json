  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke, touching on cultural, theological, and symbolic aspects. The answer effectively explores the broader implications of the sign in relation to themes of inclusivity, humility, and peace. However, the student's answer lacks a direct focus on recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs, which was the specified concern. While their interpretation is valid and insightful, it deviates slightly from the specific focus provided."
