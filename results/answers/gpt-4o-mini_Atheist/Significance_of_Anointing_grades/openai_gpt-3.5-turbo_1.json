It effectively addresses the concern by clearly elucidating how anointing was instrumental in setting apart individuals for special service to God and emphasizing the divine empowerment associated with these roles. The integration of relevant biblical references enhances the depth of understanding and supports the Christian worldview perspective on anointing in biblical leadership roles."
