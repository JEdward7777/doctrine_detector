It effectively connects the concept of anointing to divine selection, empowerment, and authority in biblical leadership roles, addressing the concern with clarity and depth. The inclusion of relevant biblical references enhances the theological analysis provided in the response. Great job in highlighting the importance of anointing in biblical leadership roles from a Christian perspective."
