The response effectively connects the translation choice to the broader understanding of God within the Bible. However, to enhance doctrinal accuracy, it could have delved deeper into specific biblical references or theological implications related to the title 'Shaddai'. Additionally, tying the discussion more explicitly to the Christian worldview and the impact on Christian understanding of God could strengthen the analysis."
