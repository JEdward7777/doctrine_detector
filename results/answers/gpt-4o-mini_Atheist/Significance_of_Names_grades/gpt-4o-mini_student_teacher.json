  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough analysis of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name, considering cultural, theological, relational, diversity of perception, and literary aspects. The student effectively connects the translation choice to a deeper understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly contrasting the usage of 'Shaddai' as a title versus a name to align more closely with the specified concern."
