The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the cultural, theological, and literary implications of this translation choice, supporting their arguments with relevant examples and insights. Their grasp of the Christian worldview and theological concepts is evident in their thoughtful exploration of the relationship between God's attributes and personal relationship."
