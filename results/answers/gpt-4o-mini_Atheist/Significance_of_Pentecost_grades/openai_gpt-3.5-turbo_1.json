The answer effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for ministry, fulfilling Jesus' promise, and guiding them in spreading the message of Jesus. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the response back to the concern about understanding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers even more clearly. Overall, a well-written and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
