The analysis is detailed and well-supported, demonstrating a clear understanding of the political dynamics at play. The discussion of Roman influence, legacy, and the shift from centralized power to localized authority is insightful and helps believers appreciate the political tensions that influenced Christ's life and ministry. Well done!"
