The student effectively explores the theological significance of these miraculous acts from a culturally and historically informed perspective, emphasizing their validation of authority, fulfillment of prophecy, demonstration of compassion and power, sign of the Kingdom of God, faith and response, and cultural symbolism. The integration of biblical references and broader cultural contexts enhances the depth of analysis. However, the response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the divine aspect of miracles as supernatural interventions that point to God's existence and power. Additionally, incorporating more explicit references to scriptural passages showcasing the significance of signs and miracles in the New Testament could further strengthen the argument. Overall, a solid and insightful analysis with room for slight improvement in theological emphasis and scriptural grounding."
