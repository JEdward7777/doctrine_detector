  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that delves into various aspects of the role signs and miracles play in demonstrating the truth of God's message. However, the concern specifically highlighted the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation, which the student did address but could have emphasized more in their response. The answer could have been improved by explicitly connecting the significance of signs and miracles to the importance of faith in receiving and recognizing God's revelation. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and provided relevant insights from a culturally and historically informed perspective."
