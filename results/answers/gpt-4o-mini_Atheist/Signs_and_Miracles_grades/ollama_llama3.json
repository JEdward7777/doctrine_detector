  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the roles of signs and miracles in Christian theology, demonstrating a strong understanding of their significance and relevance to God's revelation. The discussion is well-structured and thoughtful, covering various aspects such as validation of authority, fulfillment of prophecy, demonstration of compassion and power, sign of the Kingdom of God, faith and response, and cultural symbolism.\n\nThe response also demonstrates an awareness of the importance of considering different cultural and historical contexts in understanding signs and miracles. The mention of the scholarly examination of these phenomena is particularly noteworthy, as it highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of this topic.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have explored more explicitly how faith relates to God's revelation through signs and miracles. While the connection between faith and response is touched upon, the discussion could be more developed to fully address the concern.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the subject matter and provides valuable insights into the roles of signs and miracles in Christian theology. With some further development on the relationship between faith and God's revelation, it would be deserving of a higher score."
