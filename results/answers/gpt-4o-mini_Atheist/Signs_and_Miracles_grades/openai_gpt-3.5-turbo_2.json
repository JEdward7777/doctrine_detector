  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-supported engagement with the concern of examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation within a Christian worldview. It expands on the given answer by exploring various roles of signs and miracles in validating God's power and authority, demonstrating a deep understanding of the subject matter from a Christian perspective. Furthermore, the response connects these roles to cultural and historical contexts, enhancing the analysis. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly tie each role back to the specific concern raised in the prompt to further strengthen the coherence of the argument."
