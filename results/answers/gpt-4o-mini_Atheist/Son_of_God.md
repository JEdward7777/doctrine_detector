## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The distinction between the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus and the term 'sons of God' used for believers lies primarily in the unique nature and role ascribed to Jesus within Christian theology compared to the collective identity of believers.

1. **Unique Relationship**: In Christian doctrine, Jesus is recognized as the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16). This title emphasizes his unique and singular relationship with God the Father, which is understood to be different from the relationship that all believers have with God. While believers can be seen as children of God through faith and redemption, Jesus’ sonship is intrinsic and eternal, underscoring his divine nature.

2. **Divine Nature**: Jesus is believed to possess both fully divine and fully human natures (the doctrine of the hypostatic union). This duality sets him apart from believers, who are considered human and, by grace, adopted into God's family (Romans 8:15-17). The title ‘Son of God’ in relation to Jesus indicates his divine authority and identity, which is fundamentally different from that of believers.

3. **Role and Mission**: The title of 'Son of God' also conveys specific theological functions, such as being the Messiah and the Savior who redeems humanity (John 1:29). Believers, while called to participate in God’s work, do not share the same messianic role or salvific mission attributed to Jesus Christ.

4. **Authority and Worship**: In Christian tradition, Jesus as the Son of God is worshiped as part of the Holy Trinity, receiving adoration and reverence due to his divine status. In contrast, the status of believers as 'sons of God' implies a more relational aspect but does not confer the same level of authority or divinity associated with Christ.

In summary, while both terms connote a relationship with God, the title 'Son of God' for Jesus highlights his unique, divine identity and role within the framework of Christian faith, while 'sons of God' for believers emphasizes an adopted status and relational aspect that reflects a communal identity in faith.
