  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Son of God\" in relation to Jesus and His relationship with God the Father from a Christian perspective. The answer effectively discusses the divine nature of Jesus, His messianic identity, intimate relationship with the Father, salvific role, and cultural context. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications associated with this title. However, to improve the grade, the response could have further emphasized Jesus' preexistence as the Son of God, his unique role in creation, and the eternal aspect of His relationship within the Trinity. Additionally, connecting these points more explicitly to key scripture references and doctrinal teachings would have strengthened the overall argument."
