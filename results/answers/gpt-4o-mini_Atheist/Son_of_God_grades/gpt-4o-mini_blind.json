  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a well-written and thorough response that effectively explains the distinction between the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus and the term 'sons of God' used for believers. The answer is doctrinally sound, drawing from relevant Bible verses and core Christian theological concepts. The explanation is clear, organized, and demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian beliefs about the nature and role of Jesus Christ and believers in relation to God. Great job!"
