  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student correctly acknowledges that there are multiple interpretations for the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6:1-4, which demonstrates an understanding of the complexities of biblical interpretation. The answer also mentions three possible meanings (fallen angels, powerful political rulers, and descendants of Seth), although it does not delve into the nuances or specific theological implications of each.\n\nThe concern is about understanding biblical interpretation, which the response partially addresses by mentioning different interpretations for the term \"sons of God\". However, the response could have explored more deeply how these various interpretations shed light on our understanding of scripture passages.\n\nTo improve this response, the student could have provided a brief explanation of why each interpretation is significant or how it contributes to our overall comprehension of the biblical text. Additionally, incorporating specific scriptural references and theological concepts would enhance the depth and richness of the response."
