  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the process of becoming a saint within Christian tradition, specifically focusing on the Roman Catholic Church's formal canonization process. However, the student did not address the central role of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of holiness, which is a crucial aspect of the Christian doctrine of sainthood. The answer provided lacks emphasis on the foundational belief that believers become saints not through their own merit but through their faith in Jesus Christ. Additional focus on this central tenet of the Christian faith would significantly improve the response."
