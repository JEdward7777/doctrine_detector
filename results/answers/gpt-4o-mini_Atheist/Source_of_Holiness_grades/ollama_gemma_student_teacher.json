  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately explains the traditional process of sainthood within the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian denominations. However, it lacks clarity in addressing the concern related to the central role of faith in Christianity. The student's response would benefit from further elaboration on how faith in Jesus Christ is central to becoming a saint in the Christian faith."
