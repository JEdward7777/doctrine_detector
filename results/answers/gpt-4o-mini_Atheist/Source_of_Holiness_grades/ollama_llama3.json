However, it does not directly address the concern about clarifying the source of holiness, which is to reinforce the central role of faith in Jesus Christ. While the response mentions that sainthood is viewed as a call to emulate the lives of those who have demonstrated exceptional holiness, it does not explicitly state that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus' saving work. Nevertheless, the response does acknowledge that sainthood is ultimately based on virtues and miracles, which suggests a secondary focus on human effort rather than solely relying on faith in Christ.\n\nTo improve, the response could more directly address the concern by emphasizing that believers become saints not because of their own deeds or virtues, but because of their faith in Jesus' saving work. This would reinforce the central role of faith in Christian doctrine and provide a stronger connection to the original answer."
