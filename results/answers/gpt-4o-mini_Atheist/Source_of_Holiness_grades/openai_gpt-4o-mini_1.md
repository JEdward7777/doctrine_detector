## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In Christian tradition, the process of becoming a saint typically involves several key steps, particularly within the Roman Catholic Church, which has a formal canonization process. Hereâ€™s an overview:

1. **Servant of God**: The journey toward sainthood begins after a person dies. Their life and virtues are examined, and if there is evidence of heroic virtue or martyrdom, they may be referred to as a "Servant of God."

2. **Venerable**: The next step involves an investigation of the person's life, including testaments to their holiness and spiritual virtues. If a formal review by the Vatican concludes that they lived a life of heroic virtue, the individual is declared "Venerable."

3. **Beatification**: For a person to be beatified, a miracle attributed to their intercession must be recognized by the Church. This indicates that the individual is in heaven and can intercede on behalf of the faithful. Upon beatification, the person is given the title "Blessed."

4. **Canonization**: The final step is canonization, which requires another miracle occurring after beatification. This solidifies the individual's status as a saint, allowing them to be venerated by the entire Church. At this point, the person is officially recognized as a saint.

Different Christian denominations have varying processes and criteria for recognizing saints. For example, in Orthodox Christianity, the process is less formalized and is often based on local consensus and recognition of a person's holy life and miracles.

In all cases, sainthood is viewed not just as a recognition of virtue but as a call to the faithful to emulate the lives of those who have demonstrated exceptional holiness.
