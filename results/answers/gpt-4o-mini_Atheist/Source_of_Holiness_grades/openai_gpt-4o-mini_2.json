The concern raised is addressed effectively by emphasizing that believers become saints not through their own works but through faith in Jesus Christ. This reinforces the central role of faith in Christian doctrine, illustrating the foundational belief that holiness comes from Christ. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on sainthood."
