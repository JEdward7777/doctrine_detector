The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and effectively incorporates relevant Biblical references to support their points. The student could further enhance their response by emphasizing the ultimate supremacy of God's kingdom over earthly authorities in a more prominent manner. Overall, this is a commendable answer."
