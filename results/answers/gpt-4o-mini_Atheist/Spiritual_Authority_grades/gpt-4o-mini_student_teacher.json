  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the differences between spiritual authorities and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. They have effectively discussed the nature, source, scope of influence, interaction, and relationship between these two forms of authority, drawing from relevant biblical passages to support their points.\n\nThe only concern is that the student's answer could have more explicitly emphasized the spiritual implications of recognizing the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority in a Christian's life, as outlined in the provided reference answer. However, overall, the student has shown a strong understanding of the topic and presented a well-supported analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
