The integration of relevant scriptures such as Hebrews 5:4, Romans 13:1-2, and Acts 5:29 enriches the explanation and demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview on authority. The response effectively addresses the concern by clearly delineating the differences between spiritual and worldly authority and their significance in a Christian's life."
