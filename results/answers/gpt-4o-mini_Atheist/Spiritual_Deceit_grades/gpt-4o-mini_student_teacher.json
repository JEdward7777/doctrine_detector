However, there is a lack of emphasis on the foundational truth that only Yahweh is God, which is crucial from a Christian worldview perspective. The student's response could be improved by highlighting this fundamental belief more prominently and connecting the deception of idolatry directly to the biblical perspective of demons leading people astray from the one true God."
