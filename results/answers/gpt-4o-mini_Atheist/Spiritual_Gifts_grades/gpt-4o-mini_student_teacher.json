  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thorough exploration of the implications of the phrase \"spiritual gifts\" in the Bible, highlighting key aspects such as diversity of abilities, community and togetherness, empowerment and responsibility, recognition and celebration, theological implications, as well as challenges and misuse. The response effectively addresses the concern of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. The only minor critique is that while the student touched on theological implications, they could have delved deeper into the theological significance of spiritual gifts in shaping believers' understanding of God's active involvement in their lives. Overall, a strong answer demonstrating a solid grasp of the topic."
