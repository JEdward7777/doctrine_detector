  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 92.\n\nThis response demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of spiritual gifts in the biblical context, highlighting their purpose and implications for building up the Christian community and facilitating the mission of the church. The discussion of diversity, community, empowerment, recognition, and challenges related to spiritual gifts is thorough and well-supported by Scripture (1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12, Ephesians 4).\n\nThe response also acknowledges the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit, which aligns with the specified concern. The only area where improvement could be made is in providing more explicit connections between the discussion of spiritual gifts and their practical application for building up the church.\n\nComment: This response effectively communicates a comprehensive understanding of spiritual gifts and their implications, but could benefit from more explicit connections to the specified concern about utilizing these gifts for community growth and personal obedience."
