  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response discussing various aspects of confessing sins within a community context. While the answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of how confession can contribute to spiritual healing, it could benefit from more emphasis on the key points of accountability, support, and encouragement highlighted in the reference answer. The incorporation of a more focused and succinct argument aligning more closely with the reference answer would have yielded a higher grade. Despite this, the student's response presents a strong analysis from a culturally-relevant perspective."
