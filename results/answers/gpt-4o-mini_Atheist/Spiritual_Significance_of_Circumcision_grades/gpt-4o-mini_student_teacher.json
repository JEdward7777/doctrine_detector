  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the symbolic meaning of \"circumcision of the heart\" in a Christian context, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. They effectively connected the physical practice of circumcision to its spiritual implications, emphasizing the inner transformation and renewal of one's moral life. The student also highlighted the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for the removal of sin and purification of the heart. However, the reference answer from the teacher provides a succinct and direct interpretation, focusing solely on the removal of sin through faith in Jesus Christ. While the student's answer is comprehensive and well-supported, it could have been more concise and directly aligned with the teacher's reference answer."
