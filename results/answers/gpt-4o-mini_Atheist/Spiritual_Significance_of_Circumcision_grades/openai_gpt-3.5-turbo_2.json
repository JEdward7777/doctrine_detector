It addresses the concern by delving into the spiritual implications of physical practices, emphasizing the metaphorical significance of circumcision and the importance of inner change through faith in Jesus Christ. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to connect the discussion more explicitly to how modern Christians can apply this concept in their daily lives."
