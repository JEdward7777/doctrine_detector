  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church, addressing key points such as martyrdom, challenges faced by early believers, spread of persecution, and the clarification of beliefs and identity. The student effectively connects the event to the cost of discipleship and emphasizes the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively integrates biblical references to support the discussion. Some additional focus on the personal implications of faithfulness and the transformative impact on the early believers' spiritual lives could further enhance the depth of the response."
