The explanation is detailed, well-supported with relevant examples and references to scripture, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian worldview. The only suggested improvement would be to further emphasize the theological implications of Stephen's martyrdom in shaping the early Church's understanding of suffering, sacrifice, and the foundational principles of Christianity."
