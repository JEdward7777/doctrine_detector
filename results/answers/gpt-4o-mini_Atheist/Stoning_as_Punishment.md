## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery is primarily found in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. In Leviticus 20:10, it states, "If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death." Similarly, Deuteronomy 22:22-24 outlines the consequences for both parties involved in adultery, detailing a scenario where both individuals would face death if caught.

From a theological and ethical perspective, the implications of these punishments reflect a complex understanding of justice and mercy within the biblical narrative. On one hand, the strictness of these laws emphasizes the gravity of adultery within the community, as it was seen as a violation not only of personal trust but of the social fabric and covenantal relationship that the community had with God. The severity of the punishment can be interpreted as a means to uphold community standards and promote social order.

On the other hand, the New Testament introduces a contrasting perspective on justice and mercy. In the Gospel of John (8:1-11), there is a story of Jesus encountering a woman accused of adultery. The people bring her before Jesus, citing the law and demanding her punishment. Jesus responds by inviting anyone without sin to cast the first stone, ultimately leading to her accusers leaving one by one. He then tells the woman that he does not condemn her and advises her to "go, and from now on sin no more." This account demonstrates a shift towards mercy, suggesting that while moral laws exist, the application of these laws is tempered by compassion and the possibility of forgiveness.

This duality reflects broader themes in the Judeo-Christian tradition regarding the nature of God as one who seeks justice but also desires mercy. It invites ongoing interpretations and discussions about the balance between upholding moral standards and extending grace. The practice of stoning for adultery, while historically specific, raises contemporary ethical questions about punishment, restorative justice, and the role of compassion in dealing with transgressions within any community.
