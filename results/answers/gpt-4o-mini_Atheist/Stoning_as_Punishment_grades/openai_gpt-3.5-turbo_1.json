It acknowledges the Old Testament commands while also highlighting the New Testament example of Jesus demonstrating mercy and forgiveness. The analysis effectively incorporates biblical passages and theological considerations, connecting the concept of justice and mercy within a Christian worldview. The response could further strengthen its argument by explicitly stating how God's character of justice and mercy is consistent throughout both the Old and New Testaments."
