The student effectively connects the metaphor to foundational aspects of Christian faith, unity in the Church, reliance on Jesus for strength and support, stability in faith, Jesus' unique authority, and the themes of rejection and acceptance. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian theology and effectively explores the various dimensions of the cornerstone metaphor in a coherent and meaningful way. Great job!"
