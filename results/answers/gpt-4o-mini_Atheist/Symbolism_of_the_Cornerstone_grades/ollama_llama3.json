  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response effectively explores the cornerstone metaphor in Christian theology, highlighting its significance for understanding Jesus' relationship with His followers. The six points presented provide a comprehensive overview of the metaphor's implications, including foundation, unity, strength, stability, authority, and rejection/acceptance.\n\nWhile the response does touch on the theme of Jesus being the source of strength for believers, it only partially addresses the concern about aligning lives with Christ's teachings and example. The connection between the cornerstone metaphor and this concern is not explicitly made, which limits the depth of the response.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the cornerstone metaphor and its significance in Christian theology. With more attention to the specific concern, the response could have been even stronger."
