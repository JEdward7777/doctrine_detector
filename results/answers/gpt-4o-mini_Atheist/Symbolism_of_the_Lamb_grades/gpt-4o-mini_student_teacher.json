  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the significance of using a lamb for sacrifices in the Bible and its connection to the concept of atonement. They effectively highlight the symbolic importance of the lamb in both the Old Testament sacrificial system and its fulfillment in Jesus Christ in Christian theology. The student could have strengthened their answer by directly connecting the symbolism of innocence and purity of the lamb to the atonement process, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a strong and well-rounded response with a solid understanding of the topic."
