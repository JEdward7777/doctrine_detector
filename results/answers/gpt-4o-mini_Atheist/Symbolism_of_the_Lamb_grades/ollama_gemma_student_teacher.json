  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the symbolism of the lamb in biblical sacrifices and its significance in the concept of atonement. The student clearly explains the symbolic significance of the lamb in ancient Israelite culture, its connection to the sacrificial system in Leviticus, and its amplification in Christian theology with the figure of Jesus Christ. The response is well-written, concise, and logically structured."
