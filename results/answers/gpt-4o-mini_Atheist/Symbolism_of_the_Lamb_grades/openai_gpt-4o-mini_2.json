The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the theological implications and the continuity between the Old Testament sacrificial system and the Christian belief in Jesus as the ultimate sacrificial lamb. The response effectively addresses the specified concern by delving deeper into the significance of the lamb in Christian understanding of atonement and redemption through Christ."
