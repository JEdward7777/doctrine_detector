The emphasis on the synagogue as a community hub, a place of worship and study, a symbol of identity, a spiritual experience, a legal and ethical center, and an interfaith platform aligns well with the concern regarding the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship. The inclusion of various facets enriches the understanding of the term 'synagogue' within a Christian worldview that values community, worship, and fellowship."
