  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively contrasts the Old Testament emphasis on the physical temple with the New Testament's development of the temple concept to include Jesus Christ and believers as the dwelling places of God. The inclusion of key scriptures and theological insights enhances the depth of the answer. However, to improve the grade further, more emphasis could be placed on the sacrificial system and its significance in the Old Testament temple worship as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice. Additionally, a stronger connection could be made between the temple's destruction in 586 BCE and its implications for the Old Testament understanding of God's dwelling place. Overall, a well-written and comprehensive response. Great job!\n"
