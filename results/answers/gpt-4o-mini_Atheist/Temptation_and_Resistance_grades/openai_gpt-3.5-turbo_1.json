The details provided from the accounts in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke demonstrate Jesus' reliance on scripture and his commitment to his divine mission, which can inspire Christians to follow his example in resisting temptation through faith and obedience. The connection made between Jesus' actions and their application to believers is clear and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
