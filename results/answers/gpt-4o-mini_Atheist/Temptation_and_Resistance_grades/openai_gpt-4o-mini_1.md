## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the accounts found in the Gospels of Matthew (4:1-11) and Luke (4:1-13), Jesus responds to the temptations presented by Satan in a manner that underscores his commitment to his mission and his reliance on scripture.

1. **First Temptation**: Satan challenges Jesus to turn stones into bread to satisfy his hunger after fasting for 40 days. Jesus responds by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3, saying, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." This emphasizes spiritual sustenance over physical needs.

2. **Second Temptation**: Satan takes Jesus to the pinnacle of the temple and urges him to throw himself down, suggesting that God will protect him. Jesus replies by quoting Deuteronomy 6:16, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." This response highlights the importance of faith and obedience rather than seeking proof or testing God's protection.

3. **Third Temptation**: Satan offers Jesus all the kingdoms of the world in exchange for worship. Jesus counters with a quotation from Deuteronomy 6:13, saying, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve." This reinforces his dedication to God alone and the rejection of worldly power.

Overall, Jesus' responses reflect a deep understanding of scripture, a commitment to his divine mission, and an example of resisting temptation through faith and obedience. These narratives have been interpreted in various ways across cultures and traditions, often highlighting themes of moral integrity, resilience, and the importance of spiritual strength.
