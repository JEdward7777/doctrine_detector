  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of various terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in Christian communities, showcasing a strong understanding of the topic. The inclusion of theological nuances and the emphasis on different aspects of the practice further enriches the answer. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of conciseness, as the student included additional terms beyond 'communion' and 'Last Supper'. Overall, an excellent and thorough response demonstrating a solid grasp of the subject matter."
