  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the various terms used in Christian communities to refer to the Lord's Supper. It provides a comprehensive overview of the different denominations' specific terminology and highlights the theological significance of each term. The inclusion of references to the New Testament and early Christian practices adds depth to the response. \n\nHowever, the reference answer provided by the teacher only includes two terms, 'communion' and 'Last Supper', which limits the scope of the grading criteria. While these two terms are certainly important, the student's answer encompasses a wider range of terminology used across different Christian traditions. This additional breadth of knowledge should be recognized in the grade."
