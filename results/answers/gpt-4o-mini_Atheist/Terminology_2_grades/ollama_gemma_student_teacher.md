The Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist, is referred to by various terms across different Christian denominations and communities. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. **Eucharist**: This term, derived from the Greek word for "thanksgiving," is primarily used in Catholic, Orthodox, and some Protestant traditions.

2. **Communion**: Often used informally in many Christian communities, this term emphasizes the communal aspect of sharing the meal together as a body of believers.

3. **The Lord’s Supper**: This term is commonly used among many Protestant denominations to highlight the relationship between the meal and Jesus' last supper with his disciples.

4. **Mass**: This term is predominantly used in the Roman Catholic Church to refer to the celebration of the Eucharist.

5. **Divine Liturgy**: This term is used in Eastern Orthodox and some Eastern Catholic churches, referring to their specific liturgical service that includes the Eucharist.

6. **Breaking of Bread**: This phrase comes from the New Testament and is often used in reference to the early Christian practice of sharing meals, including the Lord's Supper.

7. **Holy Communion**: A term that emphasizes the sacredness of the meal, used in various Protestant and Catholic contexts.

8. **Sacrament of the Altar**: Used mainly in Lutheran contexts, this term highlights the sacramental nature of the Lord’s Supper.

These terms reflect theological nuances and emphasize different aspects of the practice, ranging from its communal nature to its sacrificial significance.

**Comments:**

The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the various terms used in Christian communities to refer to the Lord's Supper. It provides a comprehensive overview of the different denominations' specific terminology and highlights the theological significance of each term. The inclusion of references to the New Testament and early Christian practices adds depth to the response. 

However, the reference answer provided by the teacher only includes two terms, 'communion' and 'Last Supper', which limits the scope of the grading criteria. While these two terms are certainly important, the student's answer encompasses a wider range of terminology used across different Christian traditions. This additional breadth of knowledge should be recognized in the grade.
