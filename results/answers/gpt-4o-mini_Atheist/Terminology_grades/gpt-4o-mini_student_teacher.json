  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched list of alternative terms for a deacon, showcasing a good understanding of the various service roles within the church. However, the reference answer from the teacher specifically mentioned \"church minister,\" \"church worker,\" and \"church servant\" as alternative terms, which were not directly included in the student's response. The student's answer went above and beyond by providing additional terms, showing depth in their understanding."
