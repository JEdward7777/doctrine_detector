  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides some recognition of the various ways to identify service roles within the church, mentioning \"church minister\", \"church worker\", or \"church servant\" as alternative terms for a deacon. However, it falls short in fully exploring and explaining the different traditions and nuances behind these terms. While the list of 10 terms provided gives a good overview of the diversity of titles and roles, the connection to the concern is somewhat superficial, not delving deeper into the significance or implications of these various designations within the church."
