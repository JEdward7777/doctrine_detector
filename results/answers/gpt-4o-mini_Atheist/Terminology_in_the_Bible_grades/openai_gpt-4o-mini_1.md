## [Answer](../Terminology_in_the_Bible.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, the three terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people are "Israelites," "Hebrews," and "Jews." Each term has its own historical and cultural connotations, but they all relate to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are considered God's chosen people in the context of the biblical narrative. 

- **Israelites**: Refers primarily to the descendants of Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel, and encompasses the twelve tribes.
- **Hebrews**: This term is often used to describe the people in a broader sense, particularly in the context of their early history and in relation to their language and heritage.
- **Jews**: This term specifically refers to the members of the tribe of Judah or the broader community of Israelites after the Babylonian Exile and is commonly used in the contemporary context.

These terms are used in various contexts throughout the Bible and can denote different aspects of identity and history.
