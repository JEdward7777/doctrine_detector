  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of why it is considered wrong to put God to the test, drawing upon various reasons rooted in different religious and cultural contexts. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on the nature of God as almighty and holy, as highlighted in the reference answer. Integrating this aspect more prominently would have strengthened the theological foundation of the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
