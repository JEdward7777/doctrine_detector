  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-articulated explanation of the concepts of testing and temptation in a biblical context. They have accurately distinguished between the two, highlighting their purposes and sources. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes that God does not initiate temptation, which the student's response does not explicitly address. To receive a higher grade, the student could have included this crucial point in their explanation."
