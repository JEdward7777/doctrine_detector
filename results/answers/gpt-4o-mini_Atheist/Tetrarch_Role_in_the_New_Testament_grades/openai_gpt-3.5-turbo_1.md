# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Herod Antipas, commonly referred to as Herod the tetrarch, plays a notable role in the New Testament, particularly in relation to the ministries of John the Baptist and Jesus. Here are some significant aspects of his portrayal and actions within the biblical narrative:

1. **Role in the Execution of John the Baptist**: Herod Antipas is most prominently known for his involvement in the execution of John the Baptist. According to the Gospels, John criticized Herod for marrying Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, which led to John's imprisonment and eventual beheading (Mark 6:17-29; Matthew 14:1-12). This incident underscores the tension between prophetic authority and the political power of rulers.

2. **Encounter with Jesus**: Herod Antipas is significant in the Passion narrative. In Luke 23:6-12, he plays a role during the trial of Jesus when Pontius Pilate sends Jesus to him after learning he was a Galilean. Antipas had long wished to see Jesus, hoping to witness a miracle. However, their encounter is characterized by Herod's mockery of Jesus, and ultimately, he sends Jesus back to Pilate without any charges.

3. **Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea**: Herod ruled as tetrarch, which means he governed a quarter of his father's kingdom, specifically Galilee and Perea. His governance is set against the backdrop of Roman rule in Judea, impacting the socio-political context in which Jesus and John operated.

4. **Symbol of Political Corruption**: Herod’s actions and character are often interpreted as emblematic of the moral and ethical corruption of the ruling elite of the time. This association serves to highlight the contrast between the values of Jesus’ teachings and the ethical failings of contemporary political leaders.

5. **Historical Context**: The presence of Herod Antipas in the New Testament provides historical grounding for the events of that period. His reign and decisions contribute to understanding the broader cultural and political landscape in which early Christianity emerged.

In summary, Herod Antipas serves as a figure that embodies the tensions of political authority and moral responsibility during the time of Jesus, illustrating the conflicts between prophetic voices like John the Baptist and the ruling powers, as well as playing a part in the events leading to Christ's crucifixion.
