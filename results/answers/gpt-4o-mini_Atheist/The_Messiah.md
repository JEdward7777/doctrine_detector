## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The terms 'Jesus' and 'Christ' are closely related, but they have distinct meanings. 'Jesus' is a name derived from the Hebrew name 'Yeshua' (or Joshua), which means "Yahweh is salvation." It refers to the historical figure born in the 1st century CE, who is central to Christianity.

'Christ,' on the other hand, comes from the Greek word 'Christos,' which translates to 'the Anointed One.' This term is synonymous with the Hebrew 'Messiah.' In Christian theology, 'Christ' signifies that Jesus is recognized as the Messiah prophesied in the Hebrew Scriptures, the one who would deliver humanity and fulfill Godâ€™s promises.

In Christian belief, Jesus Christ is thus understood as both the personal name of the figure and the title that reflects his role and significance within the faith. While 'Jesus' denotes his identity as a person, 'Christ' emphasizes his divinely appointed mission and status.
