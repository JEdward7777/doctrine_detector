  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out and comprehensive explanation of what it means for God to write His law on people's hearts in the context of the New Covenant. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological implications and significance of this concept, emphasizing the themes of intimacy, transformation, personal responsibility, universal access, spiritual empowerment, and ethical living. The explanation aligns well with Christian doctrine and offers a deep and reflective analysis of the topic. Great Job!"
