  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the concept of God writing His law on people's hearts within the context of the New Covenant, offering multiple perspectives on the implications of this transition. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the principles involved and effectively connects them to broader theological themes.
