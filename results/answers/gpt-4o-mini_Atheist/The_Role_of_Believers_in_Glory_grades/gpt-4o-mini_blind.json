  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation of believers being glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. The student effectively references key passages and themes, such as union with Christ, transformation, eschatological hope, and participation in God's plan. The theological concepts are well-explained and supported by relevant Scripture. The explanation is clear and aligns well with a Christian worldview, focusing on the redemptive work of Christ and the believers' participation in it. Great job!"
