  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that addresses the concept of believers being glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. They have effectively highlighted key aspects such as union with Christ, transformation, eschatological hope, and participation in God's plan. However, the answer could have been improved by directly stating the fundamental idea that believers will be transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection and share in His eternal glory, as emphasized in the reference answer."
