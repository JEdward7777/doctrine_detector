In the New Testament, the concept of believers being glorified with Christ primarily relates to the idea of sharing in His glory and experiencing the fullness of salvation. This concept is rooted in several key passages, particularly in the writings of Paul and John.

1. **Union with Christ**: The New Testament emphasizes that believers are united with Christ through faith. This union means that they share in His life, death, resurrection, and ultimately His glorification. Romans 8:17, for example, states that if we are children of God, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ—if indeed we share in His sufferings in order that we may also share in His glory.

2. **Transformation and Renewed Identity**: Glorification signifies a transformation that believers undergo. This is often described as being conformed to the image of Christ (Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18). It involves spiritual renewal and the promise of a future resurrection body that reflects Christ’s glorious state, as outlined in Philippians 3:20-21.

3. **Eschatological Hope**: The glory associated with Christ also has an eschatological dimension, meaning it looks forward to the future fulfillment of God's promises. Believers anticipate a time when they will be fully revealed in glory in the presence of God (1 John 3:2). This reflects a hope for ultimate redemption not just spiritually but also physically, culminating in eternal life.

4. **Participation in God's Plan**: The glorification of believers with Christ indicates their role in God's redemptive plan. It shows that their salvation is part of a larger narrative that reflects God's glory. Believers are called to live in a way that reflects this glory in their everyday lives, embodying Christ-like love, grace, and truth.

In summary, for believers, to be glorified with Christ means to participate in His divine glory through their union with Him, to look forward to a transformed existence in the final resurrection, and to live in a manner that reflects the hope and purpose embedded in this calling.
