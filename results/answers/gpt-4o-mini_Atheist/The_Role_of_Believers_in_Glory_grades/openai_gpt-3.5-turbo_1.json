It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding this hope and future promise for faith and perseverance. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the concept of believers being transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection with the broader themes of union with Christ, transformation, eschatological hope, and participation in God's plan discussed in the response."
