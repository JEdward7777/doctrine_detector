  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the concept of cleansing in the Bible, relating it effectively to sin and redemption in both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively highlights the evolution of the concept from ritualistic practices to inner transformation and the centrality of Christ's sacrifice for ultimate cleansing from sin. The explanation is well-supported with relevant biblical references and demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications of cleansing within a Christian worldview. Great job!"
