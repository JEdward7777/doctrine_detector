  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough and insightful exploration of the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible, drawing connections between the Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings on sin and redemption. The analysis of the evolution of cleansing from ritualistic practices to inner transformation through faith in Christ is well articulated. The student effectively highlights the shift in emphasis from external cleanliness to inner purity and the significance of Christ's sacrificial work in providing ultimate cleansing from sin. However, the response could have been strengthened by more direct references to specific Bible verses or New Testament teachings to support the points made. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
