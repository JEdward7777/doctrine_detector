The student clearly explains the evolution of the concept from ritualistic practices in the Old Testament to the emphasis on inner purity and spiritual renewal in the New Testament. The connection between Jesus' sacrifice and the ultimate cleansing from sin is well-articulated, along with the transformative power of faith and grace."
