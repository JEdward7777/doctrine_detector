  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a good job of highlighting the significance of Christ's redemptive work by exploring the concept of cleansing in both the Old and New Testaments. The writer effectively shows how the idea of cleansing evolves from emphasizing ritual practices to focusing on inner purity and moral integrity. The discussion of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate means of cleansing is also well-done.\n\nThe response also meets the concern of understanding the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings, demonstrating how the latter builds upon and reinterprets the former. This adds depth and richness to the discussion of Christ's redemptive work.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger in terms of explicitly connecting the dots between the Old Testament practices and the New Testament teachings on cleansing. While the writer does a good job of describing these concepts separately, they could do more to show how these ideas are intentionally developed throughout scripture.\n\nAdditionally, while the response is generally clear and well-organized, there are some places where the language is a bit dense or ambiguous (e.g., \"a relational dynamic between God and humanity\"). This makes it slightly harder for the reader to follow along.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides a thoughtful exploration of the concept of cleansing in the Bible. With a bit more attention to connecting the Old Testament practices to the New Testament teachings and refining the language, this could be an even stronger response."
