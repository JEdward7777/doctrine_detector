It effectively connects the Old Testament practices of ritual cleansing with the deeper teachings on sin, redemption, and the ultimate cleansing through Jesus' sacrifice in the New Testament. The response shows a clear understanding of the significance of Christ's redemptive work in relation to the broader theological narrative of cleansing and spiritual renewal."
