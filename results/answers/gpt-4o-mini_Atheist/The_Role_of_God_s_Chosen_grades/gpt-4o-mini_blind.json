It accurately discusses their roles and significance in biblical narratives. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of God's selection process, particularly from a Christian worldview. Additionally, references to the broader narrative of salvation, justice, and divine purpose could have been further developed with more specific scriptural support. Overall, a good foundation is laid, but further theological depth and biblical analysis would strengthen the answer."
