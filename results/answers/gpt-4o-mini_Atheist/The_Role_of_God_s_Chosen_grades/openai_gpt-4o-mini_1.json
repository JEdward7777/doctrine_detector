It accurately conveys that God's selection of these chosen figures is based on His divine purpose and plans for leadership among His followers. The clear connection between God's sovereignty and leadership in the response aligns well with the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders and its implications for the Christian community."
