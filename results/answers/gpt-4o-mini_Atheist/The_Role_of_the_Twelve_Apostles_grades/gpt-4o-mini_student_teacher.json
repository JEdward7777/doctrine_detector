  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured response highlighting various reasons for the significance of the twelve apostles among Jesus' disciples. The answer demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and integrated key points effectively. However, the response could have focused more on the central role of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry as per the specified concern. By emphasizing their direct commission from Jesus to continue His teachings and establish the early Church, the student could have aligned more closely with the Christian worldview."
