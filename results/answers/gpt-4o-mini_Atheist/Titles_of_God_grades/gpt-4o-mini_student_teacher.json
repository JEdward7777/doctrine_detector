  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that refer to God as 'Almighty', their answer did not precisely match the reference answer provided by the teacher. The titles provided by the student allude to God's power and sovereignty, which aligns with the concern of enhancing our understanding of God's character through recognizing these titles. However, the student's list contains additional titles beyond the scope of titles directly referring to God as 'Almighty', such as \"The Most High (El Elyon)\" and \"Pantokrator.\" \n\nOverall, the student gave a thorough answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. Despite the slight deviation from the specified titles in the reference answer, the student effectively conveyed how these titles showcase different facets of God's character related to His might and authority."
