## [Answer](../Titles_of_God.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, several titles and names refer to God that include the notion of being 'Almighty.' Here are some prominent ones:

1. **El Shaddai** - This name is often translated as "God Almighty" and emphasizes God's ultimate power and sovereignty.
  
2. **Pantokrator** - A Greek term meaning "Almighty" or "All-powerful," commonly used in the New Testament.

3. **The LORD of Hosts (Yahweh Sabaoth)** - This title reflects God's authority over the heavenly armies and is sometimes interpreted as implying His might and power.

4. **God Almighty (in translations like the NIV)** - This straightforward title appears in various passages throughout the Bible, signifying God's unparalleled strength.

5. **The Most High (El Elyon)** - While primarily emphasizing God's exalted status, it carries connotations of His supreme power and authority.

These titles highlight different aspects of God's character, particularly His might and capability to govern the universe.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 75.

While the student provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that refer to God as 'Almighty', their answer did not precisely match the reference answer provided by the teacher. The titles provided by the student allude to God's power and sovereignty, which aligns with the concern of enhancing our understanding of God's character through recognizing these titles. However, the student's list contains additional titles beyond the scope of titles directly referring to God as 'Almighty', such as "The Most High (El Elyon)" and "Pantokrator." 

Overall, the student gave a thorough answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. Despite the slight deviation from the specified titles in the reference answer, the student effectively conveyed how these titles showcase different facets of God's character related to His might and authority.
