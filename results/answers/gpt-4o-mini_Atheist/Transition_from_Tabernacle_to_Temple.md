## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle primarily due to the establishment of the Jerusalem Temple, which became the central place of worship. The tabernacle was a portable sanctuary used during the Israelites' wanderings in the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt. It served as a dwelling place for God among them and was integral to their worship practices.

Once the Israelites settled in the Promised Land, King Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem around the 10th century BCE. This monumental structure replaced the tabernacle as the primary place for worship and sacrifices, providing a more permanent and central location for the religious activities of the Israelite community. The Temple was seen as a direct fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel, with its construction emphasizing stability and the establishment of a national identity.

Over time, as the Temple became the focal point of worship in Israelite society, the use of the tabernacle diminished. The tabernacle's significance shifted into a historical and cultural memory, recalling the time of wandering and God's guidance. Furthermore, with various destructions and rebuildings of the Temple throughout history (the First Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE and the Second Temple was constructed and later destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE), the rituals and practices associated with the tabernacle were largely superseded by the established Temple practices.

In summary, the transition from the tabernacle to the Temple represented a shift from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled existence, reflecting changes in the religious, cultural, and political landscape of the Israelites.
