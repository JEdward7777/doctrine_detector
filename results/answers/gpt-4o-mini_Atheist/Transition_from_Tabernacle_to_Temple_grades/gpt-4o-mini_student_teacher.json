  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that addresses the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple. They have accurately described the historical context and significance of the tabernacle and temple in Israelite worship. The student's answer could be improved by more explicitly connecting the theological significance of the transition from the tabernacle to the temple in terms of God's presence among His people and the covenant relationship with Israel."
