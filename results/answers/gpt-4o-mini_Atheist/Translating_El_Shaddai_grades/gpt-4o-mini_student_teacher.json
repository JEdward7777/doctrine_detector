  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed list of translations of \"El Shaddai\" in different languages, demonstrating an understanding of the variations in translation based on local Bible versions. They also emphasized the importance of maintaining the original meaning while considering linguistic and cultural contexts. However, the student could improve their answer by acknowledging the reference answer provided by the teacher, which suggests a more simplified approach to translation. Additionally, a stronger connection to the concern of accurate representation of God's name across cultures could further enhance the quality of the response."
