## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The main issue with this response is that it does not address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages. The original answer only provides a very general translation of "El Shaddai" as "God Almighty" or keeping it as "Shaddai", without considering the various cultural and linguistic contexts.

The provided response, on the other hand, provides a more comprehensive and accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages. It highlights how "El Shaddai" is translated in various languages, reflecting local linguistic and cultural contexts while striving to convey the original meaning of the term.

However, this response could be improved by providing more insight into the biblical context and significance of "El Shaddai", as well as its implications for understanding God's character and attributes. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide a clearer explanation of how these various translations reflect the original meaning of "El Shaddai" in Hebrew.

Overall, while this response provides some information on translations of "El Shaddai", it could be improved by addressing the concern more directly and providing more depth and insight into the biblical context.
