The mentioned interpretations align well with the concern about the potential misinterpretation of 'fear' leading to a distorted view of God and impacting one's faith and spiritual life. However, the response could have emphasized more strongly the significance of maintaining a correct understanding of 'fear' in order to avoid such distortions, and how this is crucial for a believer's spiritual health and growth."
