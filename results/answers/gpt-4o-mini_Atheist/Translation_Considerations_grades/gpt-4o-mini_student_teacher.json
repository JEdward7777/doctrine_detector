  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 90/100.\n\nThe student's answer effectively addresses the concern of ensuring translations convey the original text's spiritual and cultural significance by discussing the cultural and historical context, theological implications, literary and poetic qualities, continuity and identity, and scholarly rigor associated with retaining the terms \"Zion\" and \"Daughter\" in translations of Biblical texts. The response is thorough, well-organized, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of these terms in biblical interpretation. However, the student's response could have been improved by directly referencing the connection to Biblical heritage and teachings mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
