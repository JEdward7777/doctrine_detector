  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The response provides thoughtful translations for the phrase \"image of God\" when applied to humans and Jesus, highlighting significant aspects of each translation. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concept and offers insightful explanations for each suggested translation. However, a higher grade could be achieved by explicitly connecting each translation to specific Biblical passages or theological doctrines that support or relate to the proposed translations. Additionally, strengthening the theological foundation of each suggested translation would enhance the overall depth and accuracy of the response."
