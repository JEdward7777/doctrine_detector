  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful and culturally sensitive translations for the phrase \"image of God\" when applied to humans and Jesus. The translations offered capture different nuances and implications of the original term, highlighting aspects of reflection, divine presence, sacredness, likeness, and creativity. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of translation in understanding biblical teachings and how different renderings can shape theological interpretations. However, the student could have included translations that more directly emphasize the nature of humanity's relationship to God and Christ's divine essence, as specified in the reference answer. Despite this, the response was well-reasoned and explored the implications of translation effectively within a Christian worldview perspective."
