The explanation for each alternative is clear and highlights different aspects of zeal as seen in biblical contexts. The answer could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting each alternative translation to specific biblical examples where the concept of zeal is illustrated. Additionally, incorporating more direct references to biblical passages or stories that exemplify zeal would enhance the response even further."
