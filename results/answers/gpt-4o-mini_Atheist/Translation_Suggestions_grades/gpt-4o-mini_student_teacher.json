  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provided a thorough and thoughtful response to the question, offering multiple alternative translations for the phrase \"to be zealous\" and explaining how each reflects its biblical meaning. They demonstrated a good understanding of the intensity and commitment expected in the Christian faith through their selection of translations. \n\nWhile the student's list of alternative translations was well-structured and covered a wide range of nuances associated with zeal, the teacher's reference answer provided a slightly more concise and direct set of translations that align closely with the biblical meaning. Therefore, the student's answer could have been improved by including translations that more closely matched those provided in the reference answer."
