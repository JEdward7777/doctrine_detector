  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and insightful explanation of how the term \"Lord\" differs in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people. The student effectively identifies the nuanced meanings and implications in both religious and secular settings. The connections drawn between the divine connotation of \"Lord\" in religious contexts and the title or respect given to ordinary people are well articulated. The response could be further strengthened by emphasizing the distinctiveness of the divine Lordship over human lordship, perhaps by delving deeper into the theological significance of God's sovereignty and holiness. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references or theological teachings related to the concept of \"Lord\" could enhance the depth of the response. Overall, it is a solid explanation deserving of a solid grade."
