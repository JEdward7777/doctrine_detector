## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the phrases used by Jesus, such as "truly I tell you," the word "truly" can be translated in a variety of ways depending on the context and the target language. Here are some potential translations or equivalent phrases in different languages and contexts:

1. **Amen**: In the original Greek of the New Testament, "truly" is often translated from the word "ἀμήν" (amen), which means "truly" or "verily." It is frequently used by Jesus to affirm the truth of what he is saying.

2. **Verily**: An older English translation often used in the King James Version (KJV) is "verily," which carries a similar meaning to "truly."

3. **Assuredly**: In more contemporary English translations, "assuredly" is sometimes used to convey a similar emphasis on truth.

4. **Indeed**: This translation captures the affirmation of the statement being made, though it may carry slightly different connotations depending on context.

5. **Surely**: This is another possible translation that emphasizes certainty.

6. **In truth**: This phrase can also be used to convey the same meaning, especially in more modern translations.

7. **De verdad** (Spanish): In Spanish, "de verdad" translates directly to "truly" and is commonly used in translations of the Bible.

8. **Verdadeiramente** (Portuguese): The Portuguese equivalent is "verdadeiramente," which means "truly."

9. **En vérité** (French): In French, "en vérité" is often used to convey the same meaning.

10. **Toto vero** (Latin): In Latin, the phrase can be translated as "toto vero," which conveys a sense of truthfulness.

These translations and equivalents reflect the cultural and linguistic variations while maintaining the emphasis on truth and certainty in Jesus' statements. Each translation choice can also carry nuanced meanings depending on the interpretive lens of the reader.
