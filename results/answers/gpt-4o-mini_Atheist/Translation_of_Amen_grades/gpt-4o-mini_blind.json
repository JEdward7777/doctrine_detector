  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The answer provides a comprehensive list of potential translations of \"truly\" as used by Jesus, demonstrating an understanding of the linguistic nuances involved. The references to various languages and the explanations for each translation choice are informative and well-reasoned. However, for a Christian-specific worldview, it would be beneficial to include a brief discussion or reflection on the theological significance or implications of Jesus using such language in his teachings. This would enhance the answer's doctrinal depth and provide a more holistic perspective on the topic from a Christian worldview."
