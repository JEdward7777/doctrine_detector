  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed list of potential translations of \"truly\" in different contexts and languages, the focus on linguistic and cultural variations slightly overshadows the importance of accuracy in biblical translation and interpretation. The given answer lacks a direct reference to the significance of conveying sincerity and truthfulness in Jesus' statements, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher. The student could improve their answer by explicitly connecting the translations to the deeper theological implications and the need for faithful representation of Jesus' words in different languages."
