  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a great job of highlighting the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation by providing various translations and equivalents for Jesus' phrases, including \"truly I tell you\". It also acknowledges the cultural and linguistic variations that can affect our understanding of these phrases. The inclusion of examples from different languages, such as Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Latin, adds to the response's credibility.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement. The response could benefit from more explicit connections between the different translations and equivalents provided, and how they relate to the concern of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. Additionally, while the response does provide some examples from Jesus' statements, it would be even stronger if it went deeper into the implications of these phrases for our understanding of scripture.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. With some further development and explicit connections between the different translations and equivalents, it could be an even more effective and compelling response."
