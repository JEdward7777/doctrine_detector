  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how the term 'ark' varies in translation within different Biblical contexts, demonstrating an understanding of the term's nuances in reference to Noah's Ark, the Ark of the Covenant, and its usage in the New Testament. The student effectively discussed the original Hebrew and Greek words used and their contextual meanings. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of accurate translation in ensuring the proper interpretation of scripture, as the reference answer from the teacher highlights the varied sizes and uses of 'ark' containers within Biblical contexts."
