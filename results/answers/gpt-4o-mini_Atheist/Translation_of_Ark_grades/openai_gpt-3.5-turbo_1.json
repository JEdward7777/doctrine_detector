  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the term 'ark' in various biblical contexts, connecting the original Hebrew and Greek words to their nuanced meanings. The student effectively addresses the concern of accurate translation for proper scriptural interpretation. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly tie the information provided back to the concern at the beginning of the response for greater clarity and coherence."
