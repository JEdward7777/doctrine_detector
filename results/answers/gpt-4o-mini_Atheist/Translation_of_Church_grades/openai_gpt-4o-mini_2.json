The suggested terms effectively capture the essence of the church as a gathering of all believers, not just a select group. The incorporation of terms like 'faith community', 'ecclesia', and 'fellowship' particularly resonates with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the unity and inclusivity of believers in Christ."
