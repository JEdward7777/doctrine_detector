However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the theological significance of these terms within a Christian worldview. It would be beneficial to include more references to how these concepts are viewed specifically in the context of Christian theology and Biblical teachings. Additionally, while addressing the cultural and historical contexts is important, the answer could benefit from further theological depth and doctrinal correctness."
