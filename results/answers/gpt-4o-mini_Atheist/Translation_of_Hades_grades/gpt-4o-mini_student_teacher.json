  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the terms 'Hades' and 'Sheol', offering multiple reliable translation options that respect their biblical meanings. The translations suggested by the student align well with maintaining accurate biblical representation for greater understanding among believers. However, there is some room for improvement in ensuring a more concise and direct presentation of the translations, which could have enhanced the overall clarity and impact of the response."
