Comment: The student provided a thorough list of translations for the term "Holy One" in different languages, showing consideration for cultural and linguistic contexts. However, the translation choices could have been more focused on retaining the theological implications of holiness and the concept of being set apart, as indicated in the reference answer. The student's response demonstrates good understanding but could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the translations to the theological significance of the term. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in aligning translations more closely with the theological implications.
