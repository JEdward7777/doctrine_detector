The translations provided are accurate and appropriate for the respective languages. \n\nHowever, the response would be enhanced by providing more insight into the cultural and religious contexts in which the term is used in each language, and how the translation choices reflect those contexts. Additionally, the student could have elaborated on the significance of retaining the meaning of holiness in the translations."
