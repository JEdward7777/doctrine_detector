  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for the term \"Holy One\" in various languages, which is commendable. However, it does not fully address the concern of maintaining theological implications. While it suggests that translating the term requires sensitivity to its connotations and language contexts, it does not explicitly highlight the importance of retaining the meaning of holiness.\n\nThe provided answer provides a good starting point by emphasizing the retention of the term's meaning, but it could be further developed to specifically address the concern of maintaining theological implications. A higher grade would be given if the response more directly addressed this concern and demonstrated a deeper understanding of the term's theological significance."
