  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for the term \"Holy One\" in various languages, showing sensitivity to the cultural and linguistic contexts. It acknowledges the importance of retaining the theological implications of the term in translations to maintain accuracy and meaning. The only slight room for improvement could be providing a bit more depth on the theological implications in different languages."
