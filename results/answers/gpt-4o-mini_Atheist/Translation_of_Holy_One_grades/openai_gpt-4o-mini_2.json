  "grade_comment": "Grade: 93\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of accurately representing the term \"Holy One\" in different languages while maintaining its theological implications. The list of translations provided shows thorough research and consideration of various linguistic contexts. The only slight improvement could be providing more explanation or analysis of how these translations specifically capture the theological significance of the term in each language."
