  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the ways in which translations of the word 'lament' can contribute to a deeper understanding of its Biblical context. The student effectively discusses the original language nuances, cultural context, theological implications, literary forms, and emotional range associated with the term. The response could be further strengthened by providing specific examples from Biblical texts to illustrate these points and by incorporating more direct references to Christian theology. Overall, a well-written and insightful answer."
