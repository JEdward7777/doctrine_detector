  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of suggested translations for the term \"predestined,\" encompassing various nuances and contexts. While the translations provided by the student were accurate and insightful, the concern specified a focus on biblical translations related to predestination. The student's answer did not directly align with the specific biblical translations provided in the reference answer. Thus, a slightly lower grade is warranted due to the deviation from the concern's emphasis on biblical accuracy."
