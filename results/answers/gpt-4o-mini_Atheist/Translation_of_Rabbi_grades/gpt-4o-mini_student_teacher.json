  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer addressing various considerations for translating the term \"Rabbi.\" They covered cultural, historical, linguistic, and audience-related aspects effectively. However, the student could improve their grade by specifically addressing the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. They should have emphasized the importance of not diminishing Jesus' divine authority while acknowledging the educational aspect of the term \"Rabbi.\" Incorporating this specific concern would have aligned the answer more closely with a Christian worldview."
