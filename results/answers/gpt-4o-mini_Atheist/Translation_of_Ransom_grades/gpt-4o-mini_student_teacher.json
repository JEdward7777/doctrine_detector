  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the translations of 'ransom' in different languages, considering cultural nuances and contexts. However, the focus should have been on accurately conveying the theological meaning of 'ransom' across linguistic and cultural contexts, as stated in the concern. The lack of emphasis on the theological significance of the term slightly impacts the grade."
