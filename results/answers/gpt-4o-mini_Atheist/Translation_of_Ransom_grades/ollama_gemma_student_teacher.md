The term 'ransom' generally refers to the sum of money or payment demanded to secure the release of a person or property. Its translation can vary slightly depending on cultural and linguistic contexts. Here are a few translations in different languages along with their nuances:

1. **Spanish**: "rescate" - This term is used in contexts of salvation or recovery, often relating to abducted individuals or valuable items.

2. **French**: "rançon" - Similar to Spanish, it conveys the concept of payment for release, often used in criminal contexts.

3. **German**: "Lösegeld" - Directly translates to "ransom money" and is commonly used in situations involving kidnappings or hostage situations.

4. **Italian**: "riscatto" - Used not only for ransom but also implies redemption or recovery in various contexts.

5. **Russian**: "выкуп" (vykup) - Specifically refers to payment made for release, particularly in the context of kidnapping or hostages.

6. **Arabic**: "فدية" (fidya) - This term carries similar meanings but can also have religious connotations, contrasting secular and sacred notions of ransom.

7. **Mandarin Chinese**: "赎金" (shújīn) - This literally means "redemption money" and is used primarily in contexts involving kidnappings or the release of assets.

When translating, it's important to consider the cultural context behind each term, as certain languages might carry additional connotations or historical significance related to the idea of ransom.
