The information presented demonstrates a good understanding of linguistic and cultural variations related to the concept of ransom. However, the concern of accurately understanding theological terms across contexts could have been further addressed by explicitly connecting the concept of ransom to its theological significance within Christian doctrine, such as Christ being the ultimate ransom for humanity."
