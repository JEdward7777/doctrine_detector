  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of how the term \"ransom\" is translated into various languages, exploring the nuances and cultural contexts behind each translation. However, it lacks a direct link to ensuring theological terms like \"ransom\" are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts, as the focus is more on linguistic nuances rather than theological implications. To improve the grade, the response could further elaborate on how the theological concept of ransom, particularly in Christian theology, should be accurately conveyed and understood in different languages and cultures."
