  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, showing cultural sensitivity and respect. However, the student could have focused more on the concern of biblical teachings by relating the translations to the concepts of honor and respect within Christian monarchies or biblical contexts. The reference answer provided by the teacher emphasized using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' which could have been highlighted by the student in relation to biblical teachings."
