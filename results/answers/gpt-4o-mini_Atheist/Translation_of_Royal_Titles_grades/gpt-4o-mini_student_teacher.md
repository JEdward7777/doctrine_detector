The phrase "Your Majesty" is a royal address used in many cultures, and it often has specific translations that reflect the nuances of the language and the culture's traditions regarding monarchy. Here are some translations in various languages:

1. **Spanish**: "Su Majestad"
2. **French**: "Votre Majesté"
3. **German**: "Ihre Majestät"
4. **Italian**: "Vostra Maestà"
5. **Portuguese**: "Sua Majestade"
6. **Russian**: "Ваше Величество" (Vashe Velichestvo)
7. **Japanese**: "陛下" (Heika)
8. **Chinese (Mandarin)**: "陛下" (Bìxià)
9. **Arabic**: "جلالة الملك" (Jalalat al-malik) or "فخامة" (Fakhamat) depending on the context.

Each of these translations carries the respect and authority associated with royalty in their respective cultures. Note that the usage might vary depending on the specific context and the type of royalty being addressed (e.g., king, queen, emperor).

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thorough list of translations for "Your Majesty" in different languages, showing cultural sensitivity and respect. However, the student could have focused more on the concern of biblical teachings by relating the translations to the concepts of honor and respect within Christian monarchies or biblical contexts. The reference answer provided by the teacher emphasized using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' which could have been highlighted by the student in relation to biblical teachings.
