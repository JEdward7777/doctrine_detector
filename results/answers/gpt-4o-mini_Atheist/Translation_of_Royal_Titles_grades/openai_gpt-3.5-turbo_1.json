  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, showing a strong understanding of cultural nuances and respect towards royalty. The translations are accurate and respectful, aligning well with the concern of ensuring accuracy and respect in translations, even within the context of biblical teachings. The only aspect that could have enhanced the response further is explicitly connecting these translations to biblical teachings or incorporating how biblical titles of honor and respect align with these translations."
