  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, showing respect and honor towards royalty. While the biblical teachings may not directly reference \"Your Majesty,\" the emphasis on respect and accurate translation aligns well with Christian values of honoring authority and showing dignity to others. A slightly higher grade could be achieved by explicitly connecting the respect shown in translations to biblical teachings on honoring rulers and authority."
