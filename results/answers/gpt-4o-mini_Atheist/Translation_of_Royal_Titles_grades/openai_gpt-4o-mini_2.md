The phrase "Your Majesty" is a royal address used in many cultures, and it often has specific translations that reflect the nuances of the language and the culture's traditions regarding monarchy. Here are some translations in various languages:

1. **Spanish**: "Su Majestad"
2. **French**: "Votre Majesté"
3. **German**: "Ihre Majestät"
4. **Italian**: "Vostra Maestà"
5. **Portuguese**: "Sua Majestade"
6. **Russian**: "Ваше Величество" (Vashe Velichestvo)
7. **Japanese**: "陛下" (Heika)
8. **Chinese (Mandarin)**: "陛下" (Bìxià)
9. **Arabic**: "جلالة الملك" (Jalalat al-malik) or "فخامة" (Fakhamat) depending on the context.
