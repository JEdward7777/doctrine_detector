However, it lacks doctrinal clarity from a Christian perspective. The answer could be improved by emphasizing the Christian understanding of saints as believers in Christ who have been set apart and sanctified by God. Additionally, the suggestions for non-Christian and cultural translations could be further supported with biblical principles to align with a Christian worldview."
