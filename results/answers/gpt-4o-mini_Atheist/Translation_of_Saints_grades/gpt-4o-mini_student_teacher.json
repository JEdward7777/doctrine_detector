  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough answer addressing various cultural and religious contexts when translating the term \"saints.\" However, the concern specified the importance of using inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The student's answer did touch on various translations, but it did not directly address the concern by providing translations like 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.' The student demonstrated good knowledge and thoughtfulness in their response but missed the mark in directly meeting the specified concern."
