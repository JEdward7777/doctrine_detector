  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response acknowledges that \"saints\" can have different meanings depending on the cultural context, which shows an understanding of the complexity of translating this term. It also provides specific examples from various religious traditions and cultures, demonstrating an effort to be inclusive.\n\nHowever, the response falls short in terms of directly addressing the concern about using language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The provided translation options (\"holy ones,\" \"holy people,\" or \"holy believers in Jesus\") still maintain a distinctly Christian connotation and do not fully encompass the diversity of beliefs and experiences among followers of Jesus.\n\nTo improve, the response could have taken a more intentional approach to inclusivity by highlighting terms that are common across different religious traditions or cultures, rather than relying on language specific to Christianity."
