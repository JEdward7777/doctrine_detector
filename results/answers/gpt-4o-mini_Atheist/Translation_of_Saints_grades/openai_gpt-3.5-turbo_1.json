The suggestions of 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus' are inclusive and accurately represent all believers in Jesus without emphasizing specific Christian groups. The response could slightly improve by further elaborating on why these translations are appropriate in a Christian context."
