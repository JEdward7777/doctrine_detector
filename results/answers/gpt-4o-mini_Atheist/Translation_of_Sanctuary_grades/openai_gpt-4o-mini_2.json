  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-reasoned approach to translating the term \"sanctuary\" with considerations for various factors, including contextual meaning, cultural significance, target audience, connotation, and historical context. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms, aligning with the concern provided. The only minor point of improvement could be to explicitly mention the need to ensure that the translation accurately reflects the Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place, in addition to the broader considerations presented."
