The focus on deliverance, context of struggle, personal and community implications, expectations of divine action, diverse interpretations, and theological reflection demonstrates deep engagement with the concern at hand. The discussion is insightful and showcases a strong understanding of how language shapes beliefs and actions within a Christian worldview."
