  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the implications of translating 'trespass' as 'sin' or 'breaking the rules' within a church community, considering moral, community, response mechanisms, psychological impact, inclusivity, and accountability. The response effectively contrasts the potential outcomes of using both terminologies and offers insightful perspectives on how each choice can influence interpersonal dynamics and communal relationships. However, the student could strengthen the answer by further emphasizing the importance of aligning the chosen terminology with biblical principles and teachings, particularly regarding forgiveness, grace, and redemption within a Christian worldview. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references or theological insights could enhance the doctrinal correctness of the analysis."
