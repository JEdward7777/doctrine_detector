  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-developed answer that considered both the cultural and modern perspectives on translating the phrase 'house of Yahweh'. The three interpretations offered demonstrate a good understanding of the concept, though the reference answer from the teacher is more focused and directly conveys the importance of the worship space. Overall, the student\u2019s answer shows a strong grasp of the topic and engages with the concern effectively."
