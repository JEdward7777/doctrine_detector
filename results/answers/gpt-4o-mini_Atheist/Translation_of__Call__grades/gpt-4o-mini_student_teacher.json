  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful answer, offering multiple alternative translations that consider different nuances and implications of the phrase. The translations provided are coherent and relevant to the biblical context. However, the reference answer from the teacher offers a more concise and focused translation that directly emphasizes the act of naming, which could have been explicitly referenced or elaborated upon in the student's response for a higher grade."
