  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized explanation of how the translation of \"elect\" differs between older and modern English Bible versions, along with the impact on understanding Scripture. They addressed the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God effectively. The answer demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic, incorporating theological insights and cultural contexts. However, the student could have incorporated more direct references to biblical passages to strengthen their argument and provide specific examples. Overall, a strong and comprehensive response."
