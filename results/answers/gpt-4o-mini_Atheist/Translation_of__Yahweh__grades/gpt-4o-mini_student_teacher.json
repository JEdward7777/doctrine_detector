  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-reasoned explanation for why some churches prefer to use \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in translations, addressing historical, theological, and cultural factors. The response effectively addresses the concern raised about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and presented their points clearly. However, the response could have been improved by directly mentioning the importance of maintaining traditional practices while respecting the original Hebrew text, as highlighted in the reference answer."
