However, the focus on romantic and emotional contexts in some translations may not fully capture the depth of the term 'beloved' as used in the Bible, which often conveys a divine and unconditional love. While the suggestions offered are informative, a deeper exploration of the theological and spiritual implications of the term within a Christian framework would have been beneficial for ensuring a more accurate interpretation of biblical texts."
