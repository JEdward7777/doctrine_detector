  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 70. \n\nWhile the answer provides a comprehensive overview of methods for distinguishing between a true prophet and a false prophet, it lacks a clear emphasis on key biblical criteria. The answer relies heavily on general principles that may not align directly with Christian doctrine. \n\nTo improve, the student could incorporate specific biblical references, such as testing the prophet's alignment with Scripture (Deuteronomy 18:20-22) and the affirmation of Jesus Christ as the ultimate standard (1 John 4:1-3). Additionally, emphasizing the importance of the Holy Spirit's discernment in recognizing true prophets would enhance the grade."
