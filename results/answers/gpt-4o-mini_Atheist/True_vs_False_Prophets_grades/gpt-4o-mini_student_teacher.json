  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and thoughtful response to the question, incorporating various methods to discern between true and false prophets. However, the emphasis on individual and community-based criteria somewhat dilutes the importance of aligning prophetic messages with God's Word, which is foundational in distinguishing between true and false prophets from a Christian worldview. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the complexity of the issue and offers valuable insights, but could benefit from placing a stronger emphasis on the biblical foundation when addressing this concern."
