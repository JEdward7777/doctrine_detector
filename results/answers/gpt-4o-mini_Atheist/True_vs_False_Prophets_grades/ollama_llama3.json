  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive list of criteria for distinguishing between true prophets and false ones, drawing from various traditions and cultural contexts. It covers important aspects such as consistency with established teachings, fulfillment of prophecies, moral integrity, impact on the community, crisis of authority, feedback from the community, and personal experience and reflection.\n\nThe response also acknowledges that these criteria may vary depending on individual beliefs and cultural backgrounds, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking, open dialogue, and continuous exploration of one's beliefs. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the complexity of discerning prophetic voices.\n\nHowever, the grade is not 100 because the response does not explicitly address the concern of being able to discern true prophetic voices from those that mislead or misrepresent God's messages. While it touches on some aspects related to this concern (e.g., moral integrity and the impact on the community), a more direct and explicit discussion would be beneficial.\n\nOverall, the response provides a thoughtful and informative exploration of the criteria for distinguishing between true prophets and false ones, but could benefit from further development in addressing the specific concern of discerning true prophetic voices."
