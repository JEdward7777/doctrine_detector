  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that aligns well with Biblical principles on trustworthiness. They have effectively referenced relevant Bible verses to support their points and have demonstrated a good understanding of how integrity, honesty, reliability, and commitment play essential roles in showcasing trustworthiness. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused, as some points seemed repetitive or could have been combined to streamline the response. Additionally, while the student's answer provides a detailed explanation, the reference answer from the teacher is more succinct and directly addresses the essence of trustworthiness according to Biblical teachings."
