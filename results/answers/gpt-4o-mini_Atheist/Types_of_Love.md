## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In biblical texts, love is often described using the Greek terms "agape," "philia," and "eros," which correspond to different types of love. Understanding these distinctions can help clarify how various forms of love fit into the broader biblical definition.

1. **Agape**: This is often referred to as unconditional or sacrificial love. It is the highest form of love in the biblical context and is exemplified by God's love for humanity. Agape goes beyond feelings and is demonstrated through actions, embodying selflessness and commitment. This type of love is emphasized in passages like 1 Corinthians 13, known as the "love chapter," which describes qualities such as patience, kindness, and perseverance.

2. **Philia**: This represents brotherly love or friendship. It encompasses affection and loyalty between friends or family members. Philia is vital in biblical teachings about community and support among believers. An example can be found in the relationship between David and Jonathan, which showcases deep loyalty and emotional connection. In the New Testament, the concept of philia is reflected in the instructions for believers to love one another as brothers and sisters in faith.

3. **Eros**: While the term "eros" specifically refers to romantic or passionate love, it is less frequently mentioned in biblical texts. However, it is still recognized as part of human experience. The Song of Solomon is one of the few books in the Bible that celebrates romantic love, depicting the beauty and intimacy between lovers. Furthermore, when referencing marital love, biblical passages often highlight the importance of mutual respect and a deep bond between partners, which can encompass elements of both agape and eros.

In summary, while the Bible places a significant emphasis on agape as the quintessential form of love, brotherly love (philia) and romantic love (eros) also occupy important roles within the biblical framework. They each serve different purposes in relationships, contributing to a holistic understanding of love that transcends mere emotion and fosters community and connection among individuals.
