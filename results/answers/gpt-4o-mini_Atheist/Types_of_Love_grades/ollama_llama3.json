  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively differentiates between the three types of love in biblical texts (agape, philia, and eros) and provides clear examples and explanations for each. It also acknowledges the importance of all forms of love aligning with a biblical worldview, emphasizing care and commitment. The writer's use of specific biblical passages and references to David and Jonathan are notable strengths.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by further developing the connection between the different types of love and their alignment with God's love. While the writer mentions that all forms of love should align with a biblical worldview, they do not fully explore what this means in practice or how it can be applied to real-life relationships. Additionally, some minor points about the Song of Solomon and marital love could have been further elaborated upon.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the different types of love in the Bible and their significance within a Christian worldview. With some further development and refinement, it has the potential to be an excellent answer."
