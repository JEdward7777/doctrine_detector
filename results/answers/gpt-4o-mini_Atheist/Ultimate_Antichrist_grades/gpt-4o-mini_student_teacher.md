In the Book of Revelation, the ultimate antichrist figure is often associated with the "Beast" described in Revelation 13. This Beast is seen as a symbol of opposition to God and His authority, representing total rebellion against divine rule. The figure is frequently interpreted as a person or a system embodying evil and leading people away from faith. Various interpretations have linked this figure to historical or future entities, but in a broader sense, the Beast serves as a representation of ultimate opposition to Christ and His teachings.
