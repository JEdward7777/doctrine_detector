The focus on how this figure relates to God's people and the ultimate victory of Christ aligns well with a Christian understanding of eschatology and the importance of being prepared for challenges in faith. The response could have elaborated more on the significance of understanding eschatological figures in preparing for these challenges, hence the slight deduction in points."
