## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, outlines various actions and practices that it identifies as abominations to God. Here are a few examples:

1. **Idolatry**: The worship of idols or foreign gods is repeatedly condemned. This is seen in verses such as Exodus 20:3-5, where the first and second commandments warn against having other gods and making graven images.

2. **Homosexuality**: Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 state that male same-sex relationships are considered abominations.

3. **Certain Sexual Practices**: The book of Leviticus also outlines prohibitions against incest, bestiality, and other sexual practices deemed inappropriate.

4. **Dishonesty and Deceit**: Proverbs 12:22 states that lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, indicating that dishonesty is not acceptable.

5. **Witchcraft and Sorcery**: Practices such as divination, sorcery, and consulting with the dead are condemned in Deuteronomy 18:10-12.

6. **Exploitation of the Vulnerable**: Proverbs 14:31 highlights that oppressing the poor is an abomination. Similarly, Isaiah 10:1-2 speaks against laws that deprive the needy of justice.

7. **Injustice and Corruption**: Many passages highlight God's disdain for corrupt practices, including bribery and false weights and measures, as seen in Proverbs 11:1 and Micah 6:10-12.

These examples reflect a broader ethical framework in the biblical texts, emphasizing justice, integrity, and fidelity in relationshipsâ€”both human and divine. Interpretations of these verses can vary widely among different religious communities and scholars.
