  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful analysis of what it means to be adopted as a child of God according to Ephesians 1:5. The student effectively captures the key theological implications of adoption into God's family through Jesus Christ. They have incorporated relevant scriptural context, explained the significance of adoption in terms of identity, grace, intimacy with God, inheritance, and transformation, all from a solid Christian worldview perspective. The response is well-structured, clear, and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of adoption. Great job overall!"
