  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of how adultery is addressed in the Bible, connecting it to both the Old and New Testaments and emphasizing the spiritual and relational consequences of this sin. The response effectively evaluates the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality from a Christian worldview, supported by relevant biblical references. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more discussion on the potential for redemption and forgiveness in the context of adultery, as emphasized in Christian teachings."
