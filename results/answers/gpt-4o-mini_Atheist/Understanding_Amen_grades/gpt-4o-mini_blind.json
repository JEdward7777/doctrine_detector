There is a good explanation of the meaning of \"amen\" as \"so be it\" or \"truly\" in Hebrew. However, the answer could have been improved by delving deeper into the distinct Christian perspective on the significance of \"amen\" in prayer, emphasizing its role in affirming faith in God's promises and acknowledging His authority. Additionally, more explicit references to the scriptural basis and teachings of Christianity regarding the use of \"amen\" in prayer would have enhanced the response."
