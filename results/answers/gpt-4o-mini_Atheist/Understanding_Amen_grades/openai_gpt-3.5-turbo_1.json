It effectively connects the use of \"amen\" to the communal affirmation of shared beliefs and hopes in Christian practice. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the direct link between prayer and the role of \"amen\" in Christian belief, specifically highlighting how \"amen\" signifies agreement with prayers offered to God and expresses a believer's trust in God's response. Strengthening this connection would further enhance the understanding of the significance of prayer in Christian practice."
