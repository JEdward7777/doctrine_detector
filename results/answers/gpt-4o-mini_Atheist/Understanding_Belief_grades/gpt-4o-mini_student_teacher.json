  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and articulate explanation of the difference between \"believing in something\" and \"believing someone\" within the context of faith and trust. They have successfully highlighted the nuances of each type of belief and how they relate to ideas and interpersonal relationships. However, the teacher's reference answer offers a more concise and specific distinction that directly ties belief in someone to acknowledging their identity and faithfulness. The student's answer is comprehensive and well-written, but could be improved by incorporating this direct connection between belief in someone and acknowledging their faithfulness."
