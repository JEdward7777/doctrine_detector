  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written and insightful response regarding the significance of names in biblical contexts, highlighting the identity, role, divine instruction, covenantal significance, and cultural context related to names in the Bible. However, the student's answer seems to have gone beyond the specific question asked and provided a broader overview of naming in the Bible. While the response is well-reasoned and informative, it missed the direct and concise answer given in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
