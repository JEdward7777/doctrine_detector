  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean' can inform our understanding of moral purity. They effectively discuss symbolic purity, community and social order, ethical reflection, cultural context, and the evolution of concepts. However, from a Christian-specific worldview, the answer could have more explicitly tied these insights to Christian teachings on moral purity, sin, and redemption through Christ. Additionally, the response could have further emphasized the importance of repentance, forgiveness, and transformation of the heart in attaining true moral purity according to Christian beliefs. Overall, while the analysis is insightful, a stronger connection to core Christian doctrines would enhance the grade."
