  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the nature of condemnation as referenced in 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16. The analysis of the two passages is well done, capturing both the personal struggles with condemnation and the theological implications of Adam's sin leading to universal condemnation. The explanation is clear and shows a good grasp of the biblical concepts discussed. To improve, the response could delve deeper into the doctrinal significance of justification and the role of Christ's sacrifice in overcoming condemnation."
