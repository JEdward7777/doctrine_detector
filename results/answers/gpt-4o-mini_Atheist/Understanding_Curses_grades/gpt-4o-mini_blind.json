The explanation could be strengthened by delving deeper into the spiritual consequences of cursing and how it reflects a lack of love for one's neighbor, in alignment with Christian teachings. Additionally, connecting the consequences of cursing to broader themes of sin and redemption within the Christian worldview would further enhance the depth of the response."
