  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90/100.\n\nThe student provided a well-rounded explanation regarding the term \"unclean spirit\" in Christian teachings. They accurately referenced specific biblical verses, discussed the symbolic significance of cleanliness and purity, highlighted moral and spiritual implications, and connected the concept to exorcism and healing in the ministry of Jesus. The answer was thorough, well-reasoned, and aligned with Christian teachings.\n\nHowever, the student's response could have been strengthened by directly referencing the essence of demons' opposition to God in their initial definition of \"unclean spirit\". This would have directly connected the term to its significance in relation to demons as communicated in Christian teachings. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the concept, earning a high grade."
