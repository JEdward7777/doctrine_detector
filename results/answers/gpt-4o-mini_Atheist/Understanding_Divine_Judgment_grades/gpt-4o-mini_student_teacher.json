  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively addresses the concern of understanding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. The answer references relevant biblical passages and explains the differences in criteria, perspective, and outcomes between God's judgment and human judgment. The student could further strengthen their answer by explicitly contrasting God's perfect righteousness and justice with the flawed nature of human judgment, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
