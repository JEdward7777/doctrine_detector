## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The concept of inheriting eternal life in the Bible is primarily associated with faith, belief, and a relationship with God. Several key passages highlight this theme:

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: The New Testament emphasizes that eternal life is granted through faith in Jesus Christ. For instance, in the Gospel of John, Jesus states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16). This verse underscores the belief that faith in Jesus is central to receiving eternal life.

2. **Living a Life of Obedience**: The Bible also indicates that inheriting eternal life involves living according to God's commandments. In Matthew 19:16-17, a rich young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life, and Jesus replies that he must keep the commandments. This suggests that obedience and moral conduct are significant aspects of the faith journey.

3. **Grace and Works**: Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast." This highlights the belief that eternal life is ultimately a gift from God, not solely earned by human actions, although good works are often seen as a response to that grace.

4. **Resurrection and Life After Death**: The promise of eternal life is also tied to the resurrection. In John 11:25-26, Jesus tells Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die." This reinforces the idea that eternal life transcends physical death.

5. **The Kingdom of God**: Finally, inheriting eternal life is often linked to the Kingdom of God. In Matthew 25:34, Jesus speaks of the righteous being invited to inherit the kingdom prepared for them, which can be interpreted as a promise of eternal life in communion with God.

In summary, the Bible teaches that inheriting eternal life is fundamentally about faith in Jesus Christ, living according to God’s commandments, and being part of God's grace, with the assurance of resurrection and participation in the divine Kingdom. Each of these elements contributes to a holistic understanding of what it means to inherit eternal life within the biblical framework.
