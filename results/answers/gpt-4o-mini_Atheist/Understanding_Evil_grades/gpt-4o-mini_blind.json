The student effectively breaks down the definitions, explores the implications for moral character and behavior, and gives relevant examples from Scripture. The theological considerations are also well articulated. However, there could be a bit more emphasis on the foundational biblical principles that underpin the distinction between these terms, as well as more explicit references to key passages that specifically address evil and wickedness. Overall, a strong effort in explaining the nuances of these concepts biblically."
