  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of what the term 'faithless' implies, considering both religious and broader contexts. They touched on skepticism, rejection of divinity, and betrayal of trust. However, the student could strengthen their answer by emphasizing the significance of faith in one's moral conduct, as outlined in the concern. It would have been beneficial to explicitly connect the lack of belief in God to moral conduct to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
