  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the given answer by providing a more nuanced understanding of the term 'faithless' in both religious and secular contexts. It acknowledges the broader implications of being 'faithless' beyond just a lack of belief in God, by mentioning betrayal of trust in various aspects of life. The response aligns well with the concern of recognizing the importance of faith in influencing moral conduct, although it could have included more explicit references to the Christian perspective on faith and morality."
