The term 'faithless' typically implies a lack of belief or trust in God or a higher power. It suggests that the individual may be skeptical of religious doctrines, may not adhere to the practices of a faith tradition, or may actively reject the notion of divinity altogether. In a broader context, 'faithless' can also indicate betrayal of trust, not just in a religious sense but in relationships or commitments as well. The connotation often leans towards a negative judgment about oneâ€™s spiritual or moral standing. However, it's important to consider that interpretations of the term can vary across different cultures and belief systems.
