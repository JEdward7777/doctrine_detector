It suggests that the individual may be skeptical of religious doctrines, may not adhere to the practices of a faith tradition, or may actively reject the notion of divinity altogether. In a broader context, 'faithless' can also indicate betrayal of trust, not just in a religious sense but in relationships or commitments as well.
