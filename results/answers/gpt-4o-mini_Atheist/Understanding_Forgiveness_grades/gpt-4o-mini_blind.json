The references to biblical passages support the points made. One minor improvement could be to emphasize the importance of repentance in forgiveness, as while forgiveness is freely given, repentance is often seen as necessary for reconciliation in Christian teaching. Additionally, expanding on the concept of justice within forgiveness could further enrich the response."
