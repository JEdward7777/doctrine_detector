## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The early church emerged from a Jewish context, and the Israelites' perception of Gentiles—non-Jews—was shaped by a complex interplay of religious, cultural, and historical factors. In ancient Jewish tradition, Gentiles were often viewed with suspicion and sometimes hostility. This mindset was rooted in a strong sense of identity and covenant with God, emphasizing dietary laws, ritual purity, and separation from pagan practices.

However, as the early church began to take form, particularly after the resurrection of Jesus, perceptions started to change significantly due to several key factors:

1. **Theological Shift**: The early Christian message, as preached by Jesus and later by the apostles, emphasized the universality of salvation. Key figures like Paul advocated for the inclusion of Gentiles, arguing that faith in Christ transcended cultural and ethnic boundaries. This theological shift was pivotal in reshaping the relationship between Jews and Gentiles within the church.

2. **The Council of Jerusalem**: In Acts 15, the early church leaders convened to address the relationship between Jewish believers and Gentile converts. The decision to exempt Gentiles from certain Jewish laws, such as circumcision, marked a significant step toward inclusivity and acceptance within the burgeoning Christian community.

3. **Social Dynamics**: The early church often functioned in a multicultural milieu, especially in urban centers of the Roman Empire. This exposure to diverse populations encouraged a gradual rethinking of Gentile relationships. The church's mission to spread the gospel necessitated engagement with Gentiles, thereby fostering relationships that were initially conflicted but increasingly collaborative.

4. **Mutual Learning and Conflict**: Despite these efforts towards inclusion, tensions inevitably arose. Differences in religious practices, cultural norms, and social customs sometimes led to conflicts and misunderstandings. The letters of Paul, for example, often addressed such issues, reflecting both the struggles and the potential for unity among believers from different backgrounds.

Ultimately, the early church's gradual acceptance of Gentiles marked a significant transformation in the perception of non-Jews, establishing a foundation for a more inclusive faith that would continue to evolve throughout history. The relationships resulting from this shift were complex, marked by both struggles and profound moments of unity, reflective of broader societal dynamics outside the church.
