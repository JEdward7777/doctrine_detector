  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles evolved in the early church, showing a good understanding of the theological, historical, and social factors at play. The explanation of the theological shift and the Council of Jerusalem is well articulated. However, to enhance the grade further, the answer could benefit from more explicit references to specific biblical passages or doctrinal teachings that support these points. Additionally, a deeper discussion on the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding this transformation would have added a richer theological depth to the analysis. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
