  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that discussed the complexities of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles and how it influenced their relationships within the early church. The response effectively addressed the theological, historical, and social factors that contributed to the changing dynamics between Jews and Gentiles in the early Christian community. The student demonstrated a deep understanding of the topic and effectively communicated key points. The only area for improvement could be providing a more explicit connection to the specific concern raised in the reference answer regarding the challenges in relationship and fellowship due to traditional perceptions of Gentiles."
