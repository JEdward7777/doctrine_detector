  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful analysis of the significance of the title \"Most High\" in relation to God's authority. The response demonstrated a strong understanding of the theological implications and even extended the discussion to contemporary interpretations and reflections on authority. However, the student's answer could have been more directly tied back to the concern of believers struggling to comprehend God's sovereignty in their personal lives, focusing on providing clarity and guidance in that specific context."
