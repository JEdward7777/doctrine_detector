  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of being 'called' by God in Christianity, discussing both general and specific callings, spiritual gifts, discernment process, and the connection between calling, purpose, and identity. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on the personal aspect of understanding one's purpose in the context of faith, as highlighted in the reference answer. The emphasis on God's choosing and appointing individuals for His special purpose could have been more central in the student's response."
