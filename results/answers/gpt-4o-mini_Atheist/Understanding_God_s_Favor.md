## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, there are several passages that illustrate how Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and men.

1. **Divine Favor**: The Gospel of Luke mentions Jesus's connection with God early in his life. In Luke 2:52, it states, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men." This verse suggests that Jesus not only developed intellectually and physically but also grew in his favorable relationship with both God and the people around him.

2. **Baptism and Divine Approval**: In Matthew 3:16-17, when Jesus is baptized by John the Baptist, the heavens open, and the Spirit of God descends like a dove. A voice from heaven says, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." This is seen as a clear indication of divine favor from God upon Jesus's mission and identity.

3. **Miracles and Teachings**: Throughout his ministry, Jesus performed various miracles and healings, which contributed to his favor among the people. In Mark 1:32-34, after he healed many, it says that "the whole city was gathered together at the door." His healing acts and teachings captivated those around him, demonstrating his ability to connect with and positively influence the community.

4. **Compassion and Service**: Jesus's message and actions often emphasized love, compassion, and service to others, which resonated with many people. His willingness to associate with outcasts, sinners, and the marginalized illustrated a deep understanding of human suffering and a commitment to serving others, enhancing his reputation among the masses.

5. **Authority in Teachings**: In Matthew 7:28-29, after the Sermon on the Mount, it's noted that people were astounded at his teaching, "for he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes." This authoritative way of teaching contributed to his favor, as it provided a fresh perspective on the law and spirituality that many found compelling and enlightening.

These elements collectively highlight how Jesus's actions, teachings, and personal integrity fostered favor with both God and people in the biblical narrative, illustrating his role as a leader and a figure of divine purpose.
