The references to Scripture are appropriate and help reinforce the points made. The answer could have been strengthened by including more direct references to Jesus's sacrificial death on the cross as a demonstration of ultimate favor with both God and humanity, as it is a central tenet of Christian doctrine. Additionally, connecting Jesus's favor with God and men to the concept of salvation and reconciliation through faith in Him would have further solidified the response."
