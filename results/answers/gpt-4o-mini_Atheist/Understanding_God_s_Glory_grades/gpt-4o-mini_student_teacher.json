The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the unique and supreme nature of God's glory, emphasizing the divine attributes, holiness, and transcendent value inherent in God's glory. The analysis of the nature, source, purpose, impact, temporality, humility, and pride associated with God's glory versus worldly glory is thorough and insightful. The response effectively conveys the essential importance of understanding God's glory for proper worship. Great job in integrating biblical references to support the points made."
