## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Seeking God's will in everyday decisions typically involves looking for guidance from a divine authority on how to live and make choices in alignment with moral values and principles associated with a faith tradition. For many religious individuals, this process can include prayer, reflection on sacred texts, consulting with spiritual leaders, and considering the impact of their decisions on others and their community.

From a more secular or atheistic perspective, one might interpret this concept as a desire to align oneâ€™s decisions with a set of ethical principles that promote well-being, fairness, or compassion. Here, "seeking God's will" could be seen as an appeal to a higher moral standard or a collective human experience that values empathy and ethical behavior in decision-making.

Ultimately, whether approached from a theistic or non-theistic lens, the core idea revolves around making thoughtful choices that resonate with one's values and the broader impacts those choices have on oneself and others.
