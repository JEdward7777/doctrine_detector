  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provides a well-balanced perspective on seeking God's will in everyday decisions, acknowledging both religious and secular viewpoints. However, from a Christian worldview, the explanation falls short in emphasizing the importance of discerning and aligning with God's specific will as revealed through prayer, scripture, and guidance from the Holy Spirit. The reference to seeking a higher moral standard can be interpreted as moral relativism, which goes against the foundational belief in absolute truth found in Christianity. Encouraging a deeper exploration of God's revealed will and the importance of submitting to His guidance would strengthen the grade for a Christian audience."
