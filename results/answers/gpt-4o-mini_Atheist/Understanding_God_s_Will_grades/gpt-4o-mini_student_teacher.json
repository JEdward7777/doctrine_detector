  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-structured overview of seeking guidance in decision-making, considering both religious and secular perspectives. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on understanding and aligning one's choices with what is pleasing to God as revealed in Scripture, which is a core aspect of seeking God's will from a Christian worldview. The answer also does not address the struggle and uncertainty that individuals may face in discerning God's will for their lives. Therefore, while the student demonstrates an understanding of decision-making processes from various viewpoints, the Christian-specific aspect of seeking God's will as outlined in Scripture is not fully reflected in the response."
