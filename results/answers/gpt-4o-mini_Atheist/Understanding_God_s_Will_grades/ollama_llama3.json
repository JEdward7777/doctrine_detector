  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The original response provides a clear and comprehensive overview of seeking God's will, covering various perspectives (theistic and non-theistic) and highlighting the importance of values, principles, and community.\n* While the provided answer is concise and to the point, it focuses more on understanding God's desires and plans rather than exploring the broader implications of seeking His will. The concern about people struggling with making decisions that honor God or feeling uncertain about His direction for their lives is not directly addressed in this original response.\n\nTo increase the score, I would suggest incorporating a few key points from the answer into the original response, such as explicitly referencing Scripture and emphasizing the importance of aligning our choices with what pleases God."
