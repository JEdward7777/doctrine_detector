However, it lacked a clear emphasis on the specific Christian perspective of understanding God's desires through Scripture and aligning choices with His will. Additionally, it did not directly address the concerns about struggling with decisions that honor God or uncertainty about His direction for one's life. Improving the focus on the Christian view and addressing the concerns more directly would strengthen the response."
