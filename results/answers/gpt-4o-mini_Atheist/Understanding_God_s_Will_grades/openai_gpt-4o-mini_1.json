It acknowledges the importance of seeking guidance from divine authority, which is consistent with a Christian worldview. However, it could have emphasized more strongly the significance of aligning with God's desires as revealed in Scripture, especially in addressing the concern of people struggling with decision-making in uncertainty about God's direction. Adding more emphasis on the importance of seeking God's specific will as revealed in Scripture would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
