  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid analysis of the nature of God's wrath compared to human anger from a biblical perspective. The student effectively contrasts the righteousness and purpose of God's wrath with the potential shortcomings of human anger. The answer is well-structured and references relevant biblical passages to support the points made. However, to further enhance the answer, the student could have included more direct biblical references on the nature of human anger as it is described in the Bible. Additionally, tying in the concept of God's mercy as a complement to His wrath could have further enriched the discussion. Overall, a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
