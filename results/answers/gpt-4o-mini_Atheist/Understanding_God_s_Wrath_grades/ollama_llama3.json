  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response demonstrates a strong understanding of God's wrath as described in the Bible, highlighting its righteous and just nature, its purpose of upholding justice and holiness, and its distinction from human anger. The discussion of the differences between God's wrath and human anger is thorough and insightful, covering aspects such as righteousness, purpose, control, consistency, and temporality.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from more explicit connections to specific biblical passages or narratives that illustrate God's wrath. While the text does mention Romans 1:18 and Revelation, a more deliberate incorporation of scriptural references throughout the discussion would strengthen the argument and provide further evidence for the points being made.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that effectively addresses the concern about understanding God's wrath as a measured response to sin rather than an uncontrolled fit of rage."
