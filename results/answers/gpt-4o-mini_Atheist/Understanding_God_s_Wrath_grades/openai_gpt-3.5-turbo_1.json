  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive understanding of God's wrath in contrast to human anger, emphasizing the importance of God's wrath as a measured and purposeful response to sin. The elaboration on different aspects such as righteousness, purpose, control, temporal versus eternal nature, and the distinction between emotion and will is thorough and aligns well with a Christian worldview. The concern about God's wrath not being a fit of rage but a measured response to sin is effectively addressed throughout the response."
