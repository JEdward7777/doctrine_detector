  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful comparison between God's wrath and human anger, highlighting the key differences in their nature, purpose, control, temporal aspects, and emotional vs. deliberate aspects. The emphasis on God's wrath being a measured response to sin, rather than a fit of rage, aligns well with the concern provided. Overall, the analysis is well-supported and demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on the concept of wrath."
