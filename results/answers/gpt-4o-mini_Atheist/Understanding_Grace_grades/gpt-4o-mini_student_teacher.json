  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of grace in a Christian context, emphasizing unmerited favor, divine assistance, redemption, forgiveness, and transformational power. The incorporation of relevant Bible verses and theological concepts demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. However, the student could have more explicitly highlighted the aspect of grace as God's unmerited favor towards sinful humanity, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
