  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and informative explanation of the biblical definition of \"heaven\" and the distinction from \"sky\" both theologically and linguistically. The answer upholds doctrinal correctness by emphasizing the spiritual significance and divine realm aspect of heaven in contrast to the physical nature of the sky. Additionally, the student effectively references relevant biblical passages to support their points. Well done!"
