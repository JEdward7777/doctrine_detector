  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the biblical definitions of \"heaven\" and \"sky\" from both theological and linguistic perspectives. They correctly emphasized the spiritual significance of heaven as a divine realm where God resides, as well as the physical nature of the sky as the atmosphere and celestial space. The student effectively highlighted the distinction in meaning and usage between these terms in Scripture. However, the student's answer could be improved by directly referencing specific biblical passages that support their points and by providing a more precise definition of the term \"sky\" based on the biblical context."
