## [Answer](../Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The biblical definition of "heaven" and its distinction from "sky" can be understood from both a theological and a linguistic standpoint.

In the Bible, "heaven" generally refers to a divine realm where God resides, alongside the angelic beings and the blessed souls. It signifies a state or place of holiness, peace, and eternal life. For example, many passages in the New Testament, such as John 14:2-3 and Revelation 21, describe heaven as a place of ultimate fellowship with God, free from suffering and sin.

Conversely, "sky" in the biblical context often refers to the physical atmosphere and celestial space, the domain of clouds, birds, and celestial bodies. In Hebrew, the term "shamayim" is used, which can denote both the sky and the heavens in a more earthly sense (like the observable sky).

The key differences center around purpose and essence: "heaven" is often imbued with spiritual significance and a connection to the divine, while "sky" is more about the natural, observable world. The dual meanings can sometimes create a blend in how the terms are used, but fundamentally, heaven has a distinct theological connotation, while sky is generally physical and tangible.
