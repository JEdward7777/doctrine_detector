  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive overview of the implications of God's absolute holiness on various aspects of human life and spirituality, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on the sinful nature of humanity and the need for reconciliation with God through His allowance. The response touches on the implications of recognizing sin and the desire for a relationship with God, but it does not explicitly link these points to the idea that our sinful nature requires God's grace and permission to approach Him. It could have been more focused on the specific concern provided in the prompt."
