The answer effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the need for acknowledgment of human sinfulness and the requirement for divine allowance to approach a holy God. The only potential improvement could be a more explicit connection between the answer and the concerns raised. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
