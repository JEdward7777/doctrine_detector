  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as an 85.\n\nThe student demonstrated a good understanding of the distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression based on a biblical perspective. They provided clear explanations for each term and how they relate to moral wrongdoing and human behavior. The student appropriately highlighted the nuances between the terms, showing a depth of understanding. However, the student's definition of iniquity was slightly broader than the reference answer provided by the teacher, as they described it as moral depravity or ethical distortion rather than deliberate acts of great wickedness. While this interpretation is not incorrect, it deviates slightly from the more specific definition given in the reference answer. Overall, the student showcased a strong grasp of the biblical distinctions between these terms."
