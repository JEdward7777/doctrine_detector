  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the distinctions between \"sin,\" \"transgression,\" and \"iniquity\" within a biblical context, going beyond the given answer to highlight the nuances of each term. The discussion effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how understanding these distinctions can aid Christians in recognizing the seriousness of their actions and the need for repentance. Great job incorporating a Christian worldview perspective."
