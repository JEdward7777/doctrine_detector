  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the biblical concept of innocence in the context of wrongful accusations. Scriptural references are appropriately used to support the explanation, and the student effectively connects Old Testament teachings on false witness with the New Testament narrative of Jesus' innocence. The explanation is well-rounded, emphasizing the broader moral implications of innocence beyond mere lack of guilt. Great job overall!"
