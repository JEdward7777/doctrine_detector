  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of innocence in biblical teachings, referencing both the Old and New Testaments to support their points. They accurately explain that innocence means not being guilty of the wrongdoing one is accused of and connect this to broader themes of justice, righteousness, and the treatment of the innocent. The response could be improved by directly stating that innocence means not being deserving of punishment, as outlined in the reference answer, to align more closely with the Christian worldview. Overall, the student provides a thoughtful and well-supported interpretation of innocence in the biblical context."
