## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
To act justly according to God's laws typically involves adhering to a set of ethical and moral principles that are believed to be divinely ordained. In various religious traditions, these laws often encompass notions of fairness, righteousness, and respect for others. For example, in the Judeo-Christian context, acting justly may involve following the Ten Commandments, promoting compassion, helping those in need, and ensuring equitable treatment for all individuals.

From a broader cultural perspective, this notion of justice can be interpreted in several ways:

1. **Ethical Standards:** Many cultures have their frameworks for justice that may not directly relate to divine laws but still promote similar values like honesty, integrity, and accountability.

2. **Social Justice:** Acting justly might also mean advocating for social justice issues, such as the rights of marginalized groups, which aligns with some interpretations of divine justice.

3. **Legal Justice Systems:** In many societies, just actions also involve compliance with civil laws and contributing to the well-being of the community, balancing individual actions with collective rights.

Overall, the concept of acting justly can encompass a range of actions that align with both divine principles (for those who believe in them) and secular ethical standards.
