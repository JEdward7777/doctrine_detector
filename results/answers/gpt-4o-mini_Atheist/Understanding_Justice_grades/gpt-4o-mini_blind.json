However, it lacks depth in explaining how these laws specifically apply in a Christian context. The answer touches on cultural and social justice aspects but could benefit from a stronger emphasis on Biblical teachings and the centrality of God's laws in guiding just actions. A more focused and doctrinally sound explanation would strengthen the response."
