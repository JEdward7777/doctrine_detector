  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful response discussing various interpretations of acting justly according to God's laws. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the specific biblical standard of fairness and righteousness as outlined in the reference answer. The student could improve by focusing more on the biblical perspective and the importance of aligning actions with God's principles of fairness, honesty, and integrity."
