  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and well-explained understanding of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. The student effectively differentiates between the Old and New Testament contexts and accurately presents the significance of the term in each. The use of scriptural references enhances the explanation and demonstrates a sound knowledge of Christian theology. Great job!"
