  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the significance of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. They have effectively highlighted the different meanings and contexts in which the term is used, demonstrating a clear understanding of its implications. The response aligns with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the authority, divinity, and lordship of God and Jesus. However, the student could have further emphasized the direct correlation between the term \"Lord\" and Jesus's divinity as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher."
