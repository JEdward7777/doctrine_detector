  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65/100\n\nComment: The response provides a decent explanation of the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character from a general perspective, acknowledging the greatness, power, and sovereignty attributed to the divine. However, the answer lacks specificity to the Christian worldview. It does not delve deeply into the biblical understanding of God's majesty, His holiness, His transcendence, and His sovereign rule. The mention of societal values and cultural perspectives, while somewhat relevant, detracts from a focused Christian explanation. To improve, the student should incorporate more biblical references and theological insights specific to Christianity when discussing God's majesty."
