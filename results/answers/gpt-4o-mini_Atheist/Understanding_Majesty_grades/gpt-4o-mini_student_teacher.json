  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60.\n\nComment: The student's response provides a general understanding of the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character, mentioning attributes such as greatness, power, sovereignty, and the sense of awe it evokes. However, their answer lacks a clear focus on God's sovereignty over creation, which is the specified concern in this context. Additionally, the student's explanation delves into cultural perspectives and societal influences rather than purely focusing on the Christian understanding of God's majesty as the supreme King over the universe. More emphasis on God's sovereignty and centrality in the context of creation would have strengthened the response."
