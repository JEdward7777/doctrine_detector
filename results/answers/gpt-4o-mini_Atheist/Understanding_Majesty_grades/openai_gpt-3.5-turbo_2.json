  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's character, emphasizing His greatness and sovereignty. However, the additional details and perspectives offered in the original response slightly deviate from the focus on understanding God's attributes and sovereignty over creation, which was the specified concern. While the elaboration enriches the discussion, a more direct alignment with the concern would have strengthened the overall grade."
