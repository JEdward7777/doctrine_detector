The suggestions offered are practical and aligned with a merciful outlook in line with Christian teachings. However, the response could have been strengthened by incorporating more explicit references to God's merciful nature and how Christians are called to reflect that mercy in daily life. Emphasizing the importance of God's mercy as the ultimate example could have deepened the theological foundation of the answer. Additionally, connecting each practical suggestion back to biblical examples or teachings on mercy would have enhanced the response."
