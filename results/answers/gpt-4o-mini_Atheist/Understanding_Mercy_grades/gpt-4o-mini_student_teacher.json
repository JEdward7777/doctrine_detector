  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 70. \n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of actionable principles and practices to embody a merciful attitude in daily life, they could improve their answer by explicitly tying these actions back to God's merciful nature. By incorporating more direct references to God's kindness, forgiveness, and compassion, the student could better align their response with the concern of encouraging individuals to embody the merciful nature of God. Overall, the student's answer provides valuable insights and practical suggestions for demonstrating mercy in daily interactions."
