The practical suggestions for empathy, forgiveness, support, compassion, patience, self-mercy, gratitude, and encouraging positive change are all in line with encouraging individuals to embody the merciful nature of God. However, the response could have included more explicit references to biblical teachings on mercy and how these actions align with God's character as a framework for demonstrating mercy in daily interactions."
