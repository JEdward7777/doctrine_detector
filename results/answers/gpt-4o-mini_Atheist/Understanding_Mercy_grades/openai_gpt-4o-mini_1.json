The actionable principles and practices outlined align well with encouraging individuals to embody the merciful nature of God in their interactions with others from a Christian worldview. However, the response could have included more explicit references to God's mercy and the example of Jesus Christ as the ultimate demonstration of mercy. This would have further emphasized the Christian perspective on mercy."
