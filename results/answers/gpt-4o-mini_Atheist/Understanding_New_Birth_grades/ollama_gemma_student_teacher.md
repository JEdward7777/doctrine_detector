## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Being "born again" is a term primarily found in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of John, chapter 3. The concept is introduced during an interaction between Jesus and Nicodemus, a Pharisee. In this context, being born again refers to a spiritual rebirth that is necessary for entering the Kingdom of God.

1. **Spiritual Rebirth**: The phrase suggests a transformation or renewal of the individualâ€™s spirit. Jesus explains that to see the Kingdom of God, one must be "born of water and the Spirit." This indicates a distinction between physical birth and a spiritual rebirth.

2. **Repentance and Faith**: In other parts of the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul and the letters, the concept is often associated with repentance (turning away from sin) and faith in Jesus Christ as the Savior. This includes an acceptance of Jesus's sacrifice and resurrection, which, according to Christian belief, grants forgiveness and a new life.

3. **New Identity**: Being born again implies a new identity in Christ. Believers are seen as new creations, indicating a fundamental change in their lives, values, and relationship with God.

4. **Transformation of Life**: The process that comes with being born again typically leads to a transformation in behavior, priorities, and lifestyle. This transformation is often accompanied by the work of the Holy Spirit, guiding and empowering believers to live according to God's will.

In summary, "born again" represents a critical aspect of Christian doctrine, emphasizing the necessity of a spiritual renewal through faith in Jesus, leading to a new life and relationship with God.
