  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 90.\n\nThe response provides a thorough and well-explained understanding of what it means to 'perish' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. It accurately incorporates key biblical passages and doctrinal concepts, such as separation from God, eternal consequences, lack of spiritual life, rejection of God's grace, and the call to embrace faith in Christ. The explanation is comprehensive, clear, and rooted in Christian doctrine. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is that some key passages related to the concept of perishing in the New Testament could have been quoted directly for added biblical support. Overall, an excellent response."
