  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of what it means to 'perish' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament, exploring various aspects such as separation from God, eternal consequences, lack of spiritual life, rejection of God\u2019s grace, and the present reality versus future hope. The student effectively references relevant biblical passages to support their points. However, the student's answer could be more concise and focused on the core definition of perishing spiritually as being lost or separated from the people of God due to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation, as stated in the reference answer."
