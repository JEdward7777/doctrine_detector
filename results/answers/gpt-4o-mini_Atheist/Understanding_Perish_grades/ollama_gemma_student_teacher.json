  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of spiritual perishing in the New Testament. It clearly outlines the various aspects of this concept, including separation from God, eternal consequences, lack of spiritual life, rejection of God's grace, and the present reality of perishing. The student's ability to connect the concept to the people of God and the need for faith in Jesus is also commendable."
