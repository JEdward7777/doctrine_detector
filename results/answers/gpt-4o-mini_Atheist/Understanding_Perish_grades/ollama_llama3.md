## [Answer](../Understanding_Perish.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of "perishing" carries significant spiritual implications, often associated with spiritual death, separation from God, and the consequences of sin. Here are a few key points that outline what it means to 'perish' in this context:

1. **Separation from God**: The New Testament portrays spiritual perishing as a consequence of sin that leads to separation from God. For instance, passages like John 3:16-18 indicate that belief in Jesus is crucial for salvation, suggesting that those who do not believe are already condemned or in a state of perishing.

2. **Eternal Consequences**: Perishing is often tied to the idea of eternal judgment. In Matthew 10:28, Jesus speaks of both the body and soul being destroyed in hell, highlighting a severe outcome for those who reject God's ways. This signifies not just a physical death but a spiritual demise that lasts eternally.

3. **Lack of Spiritual Life**: In John 10:10, Jesus contrasts the thief who "comes only to steal and kill and destroy" with Himself, stating He came to give life, and life abundantly. This suggests that to perish spiritually means to live in a state devoid of true spiritual vitality and fulfillment offered through a relationship with Christ.

4. **Rejection of God’s Grace**: Spiritual perishing can also be viewed as the result of rejecting God's grace and mercy. The New Testament emphasizes the importance of accepting the gift of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9). Those who do not accept this gift are viewed as remaining in their sinful state and thus perishing.

5. **Present Reality and Future Hope**: While the notion of perishing includes future judgment, it also reflects a present reality where individuals lead lives devoid of purpose and peace apart from God. The New Testament calls believers to evangelize and offer hope to those in danger of perishing.

In summary, to 'perish' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament implies a separation from God due to sin, leading to eternal consequences, a lack of spiritual life, and a rejection of God’s grace, while also serving as a call to embrace faith and find life in Christ.
