They effectively discussed themes such as atonement for sin, divine justice and mercy, covenantal fulfillment, restoration of relationship, and transformation/imitation. However, there is a slight deviation from the concern as the explanation, though thorough, could have been more focused on clearly connecting Jesus' sacrifice to the satisfaction of God's justice and wrath through propitiation. A more direct integration of how Jesus' sacrifice directly relates to God's justice and mercy in the context of propitiation would have strengthened the response further."
