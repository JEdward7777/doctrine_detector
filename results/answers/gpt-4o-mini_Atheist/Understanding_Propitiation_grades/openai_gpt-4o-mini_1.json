  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of how Jesus' sacrifice relates to propitiation, focusing on the concepts of atonement for sin, divine justice and mercy, covenantal fulfillment, restoration of relationship, and transformation and imitation. The explanation effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath while also demonstrating divine mercy and love. The response could be improved by explicitly connecting each point made back to the central themes of God's justice and mercy for a more cohesive presentation."
