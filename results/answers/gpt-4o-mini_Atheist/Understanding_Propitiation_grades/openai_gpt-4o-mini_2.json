It effectively discusses how Jesus' sacrifice reconciles God's justice and mercy, providing a means for sinners to receive forgiveness and eternal life. The response could have been improved by directly addressing the Old Testament sacrificial system and covenantal fulfillment to further illustrate the connection between propitiation, justice, and mercy."
