  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that explored various dimensions of purification in the Old Testament, linking it to holiness, ritual cleanliness, moral implications, community cohesion, foreshadowing, and the covenantal relationship with God. While the response was thorough and demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing more explicitly the connection between purification and the nature of sin, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in aligning the answer more closely to the specific concern provided."
