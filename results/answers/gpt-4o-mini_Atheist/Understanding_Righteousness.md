## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In many religious and philosophical traditions, the term 'righteous' when applied to God generally denotes qualities such as moral perfection, justice, and adherence to a standard of goodness. Here are several key aspects of this concept:

1. **Moral Perfection**: Describing God as righteous suggests that God embodies the highest moral standards. This concept implies that God's actions and decrees are aligned with what is considered morally good and just.

2. **Justice**: Righteousness is often closely associated with the idea of justice. A righteous God is believed to uphold justice, ensuring that good is rewarded and evil is punished. This can foster a sense of order and fairness within the universe.

3. **Covenantal Faithfulness**: In many religious traditions, particularly within the Abrahamic faiths, God's righteousness is linked to His faithfulness to covenants made with humanity. This means that God is seen as faithful to His promises and commitments.

4. **Moral Authority**: Godâ€™s righteousness also implies a moral authority from which ethical norms derive. Believers may look to God's nature and actions as the ultimate standard for righteousness in human conduct.

5. **Compassion and Mercy**: Interestingly, many interpretations of divine righteousness also incorporate aspects of compassion and mercy. A righteous God is not only just but also seeks to guide humanity toward redemption and restoration rather than mere retribution.

6. **Transcendence and Immanence**: The idea of God's righteousness can also highlight a theological tension between transcendence (God's existence beyond and independent from the material universe) and immanence (God's active engagement in the world and human affairs). 

In summary, when God is described as righteous, it conveys a comprehensive view of a deity who exemplifies ultimate goodness, justice, and moral integrity, while also implying an active role in upholding these principles within the context of human experience.
