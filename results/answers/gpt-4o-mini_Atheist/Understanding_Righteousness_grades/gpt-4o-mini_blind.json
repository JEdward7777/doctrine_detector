  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of what it means for God to be described as 'righteous'. The answer covers various aspects of God's righteousness such as moral perfection, justice, covenantal faithfulness, moral authority, compassion, and transcendence/immanence. The explanation is informative and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept. However, the response could be strengthened by integrating specific references to biblical passages or Christian theological teachings that further illustrate the attributes of God's righteousness within a Christian worldview."
