  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-articulated explanation of the concept of God's righteousness, touching on various key aspects. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the condemnation of sin as a crucial component of God's righteousness, which is highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Incorporating this aspect more prominently would have further enhanced the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective. Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, but there is room for improvement in aligning the answer more closely with the Christian-specific perspective provided in the reference answer."
