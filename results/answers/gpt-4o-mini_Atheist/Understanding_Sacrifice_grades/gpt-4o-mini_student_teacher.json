  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive explanation of why Jesus is referred to as the 'Lamb of God', highlighting various connections with the sacrificial system of the Old Testament and how this symbolism is integrated into Christian theology. The student has effectively demonstrated an understanding of the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption, as well as showing depth in exploring the theological implications of this title.\n\nWhile the student's answer is well-researched and insightful, it could be strengthened by explicitly focusing on Jesus as the perfect and unblemished sacrifice paying for people's sins, which is the core idea emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. This central aspect could have been highlighted more prominently in the student's response. Nonetheless, the student has provided a solid explanation that aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively conveys the significance of Jesus as the 'Lamb of God'."
