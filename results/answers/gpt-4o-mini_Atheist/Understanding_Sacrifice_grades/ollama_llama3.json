  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does a great job of connecting Jesus' title as the \"Lamb of God\" to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, highlighting the themes of innocence, purity, and sacrifice that are central to Christian theology. The writer also effectively explains how Jesus' death serves as a fulfillment and superseding of the need for ongoing animal sacrifices in the Old Testament.\n\nThe response is strong because it not only describes the significance of the title \"Lamb of God\" but also provides biblical examples and explanations that support its claims. Additionally, the writer does a good job of exploring the theological implications of this title, highlighting themes such as redemption, innocence, and divine love.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to further develop the connection between Jesus' sacrifice and the believer's experience of forgiveness and reconciliation with God. While the response touches on this theme, it could be expanded upon to provide a more nuanced understanding of how Jesus' sacrificial death affects believers today.\n\nComment: This response is strong because it provides clear connections between Jesus' title as the \"Lamb of God\" and the sacrificial system in the Old Testament.
