  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the significance of Jesus being called the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to the sacrificial system outlined in the Old Testament. It effectively connects the sacrificial practices of the Old Testament to the redemptive role of Jesus in Christian theology. The inclusion of references to the Passover lamb, the broader sacrificial system, New Testament interpretations, and theological implications demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how Jesus' sacrificial role fulfills God's plan for redemption."
