  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the term \"Shaddai\" in the context of the Old Testament, highlighting its significance in emphasizing God's power and provision for His people. The student effectively connects the term to key passages like Genesis 17:1 and Job, showing an understanding of how it contributes to the portrayal of God's nature and attributes in Scripture. \n\nHowever, the student's answer does not delve into the etymology of the term \"Shaddai\" as the reference answer does, missing out on an important aspect of understanding the term's original meaning and implications. Including this detail would have strengthened the student's response and provided a more comprehensive view of the term's significance in Old Testament theology. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a solid grasp of the concept but could have benefited from a more thorough exploration of the term's linguistic roots."
