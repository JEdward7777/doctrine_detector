The explanation is rooted in Scripture and demonstrates an understanding of the nature and attributes of God as revealed in the Bible. The additional insights on the association of \"Shaddai\" with divine sovereignty and comfort further enhance the understanding of God's character. Great job incorporating scriptural references and theological reflection."
