  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured analysis of the strategies Jesus used to resist the temptations presented by Satan. They have accurately highlighted key elements such as Jesus's use of scripture, affirmation of his spiritual identity, prayer, rejection of materialism, and moral integrity. The student effectively connects these strategies to broader philosophical and ethical principles, making the answer insightful and practical. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating more specific references to relevant biblical passages and perhaps delving deeper into the theological implications of Jesus's actions."
