  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing various strategies Jesus used to resist temptation, such as scriptural knowledge, spiritual identity, prayer, rejection of materialism and power, and moral integrity. While the answer is well-reasoned and thought out, there is a slight deviation from the central focus of scripture and faith that is emphasized in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the student's response could have tied each strategy back to the central theme of scripture and faith as the primary means of resisting temptation. Overall, the student demonstrated good understanding and analysis of the topic, but could benefit from more alignment with the core Christian principle of reliance on scripture and faith."
