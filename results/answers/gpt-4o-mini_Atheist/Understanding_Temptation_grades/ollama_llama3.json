  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a detailed and biblical account of Jesus' resistance to temptation, highlighting key strategies such as scriptural knowledge, spiritual identity, prayer and connection with God, rejection of materialism and power, and moral integrity. These strategies are not only relevant to Jesus' situation but also provide a framework for addressing challenges that individuals may face in their daily lives.\n\nThe response aligns well with the given answer, emphasizing Jesus' use of scripture and faith as key components in resisting temptation. It also addresses the concern of understanding how to combat temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ by providing practical applications from Jesus' example.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by further expanding on the implications of these strategies for daily Christian living. For instance, it might have been helpful to provide more concrete examples or suggestions for how individuals can apply these principles in their own lives. Nevertheless, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding and resisting temptation as a follower of Christ."
