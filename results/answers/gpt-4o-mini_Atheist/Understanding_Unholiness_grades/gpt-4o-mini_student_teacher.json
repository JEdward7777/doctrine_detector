  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and detailed list of characteristics associated with an unholy life, along with practical ways to identify them in personal actions and society. However, the answer lacks a specific Christian perspective on what constitutes an 'unholy' life, focusing more on general ethical principles rather than a biblical understanding. Encouraging the student to incorporate references to biblical teachings and the importance of honoring God in defining unholy behavior would strengthen the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
