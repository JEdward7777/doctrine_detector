It emphasizes the importance of self-examination and societal awareness, which aligns with the concern presented. However, from a Christian worldview, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the biblical understanding of what constitutes an unholy life and how it relates to rebellion against God's commandments. Integrating more explicitly Christian viewpoints and scriptural references could have further enhanced the response."
