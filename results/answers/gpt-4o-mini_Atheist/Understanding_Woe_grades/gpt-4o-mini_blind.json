The explanation is clear and traces the usage of \"woe\" from the Old Testament prophetic literature to the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament. The response effectively conveys the gravity and significance of the term in relation to divine judgment and the call to repentance. However, there could be a deeper exploration of how \"woe\" reflects the righteousness and justice of God in delivering warnings and judgments. Additionally, connecting \"woe\" to the broader theological framework of sin, grace, and redemption would enhance the response."
