  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment. They accurately described the significance of the term \"woe\" in conveying a sense of lamentation and impending divine judgment, supported by references from both the Old and New Testaments. The student also appropriately connected the term \"woe\" to the call for reflection, repentance, and righteous behavior. The only minor improvement could be to further emphasize the aspect of suffering as punishment for sins in their explanation. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response."
