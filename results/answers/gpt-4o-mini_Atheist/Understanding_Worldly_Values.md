## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In Christian teachings, the term 'worldly' often implies a focus on materialism, secular concerns, and lifestyles that prioritize earthly pleasures and desires over spiritual or divine values. It is typically associated with behaviors and values that are seen as contrary to the principles of faith, such as excessive pursuit of wealth, hedonism, and moral laxity.

Christians may view worldly behaviors as distractions that can lead individuals away from their relationship with God. Passages from the Bible, such as 1 John 2:15-17, caution believers against loving the world or the things in the world, emphasizing the importance of aligning oneâ€™s values with spiritual, eternal truths rather than transient, earthly matters.

Consequently, the term 'worldly' often carries a negative connotation within Christian discourse, suggesting a need for spiritual vigilance and a call to prioritize one's faith and moral integrity over societal temptations.
