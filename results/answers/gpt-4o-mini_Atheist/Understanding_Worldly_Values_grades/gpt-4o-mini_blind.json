  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This answer provides a thorough explanation of what the term 'worldly' implies according to Christian teachings. It accurately highlights the focus on materialism, secular concerns, and earthly pleasures that are seen as contrary to spiritual values. The student effectively references 1 John 2:15-17 to support their points and conveys the negative connotation associated with being 'worldly' in Christian discourse. The response could have been enhanced by including a bit more on the grace and redemption offered to those who may have strayed into worldly behaviors but overall it is well-written and doctrinally sound."
