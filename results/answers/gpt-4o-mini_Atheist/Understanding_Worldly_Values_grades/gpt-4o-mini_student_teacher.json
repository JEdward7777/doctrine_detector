The response effectively highlights the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, referencing relevant biblical passages to support their points. While the student's answer is slightly broader in its interpretation of 'worldly' compared to the reference answer, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept within a Christian worldview."
