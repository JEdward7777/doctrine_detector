  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the contrast between worldly values and godly principles within a Christian worldview. The explanation provided is clear, insightful, and supported by relevant biblical references. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include more examples of specific worldly behaviors that contradict godly principles to further illustrate the distinction."
