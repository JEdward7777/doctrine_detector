However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the response lacks emphasis on the exclusivity of worship directed towards the one true God. Additionally, the portrayal of worship as extending to ideals, people, and cultural practices may blur the distinction between worship of the Creator and created things, which could lead to idolatry. In future responses, it would be beneficial to emphasize the importance of worship rooted in biblical principles and the unique relationship Christians have with God through Jesus Christ."
