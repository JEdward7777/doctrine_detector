  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the concept of worship, including its various forms and interpretations across different contexts. However, the answer lacked a specific focus on the Christian perspective of worship, as highlighted in the concern. In a Christian worldview, worship is more than just showing respect or admiration; it involves a deep, personal relationship with God, honoring Him as the ultimate authority and source of all goodness. The student's answer could have been improved by emphasizing this aspect and aligning it more closely with the Christian understanding of worship."
