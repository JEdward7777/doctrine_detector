  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and comprehensive response that adequately addresses the concern. It correctly defines worship as an act of reverence, adoration, or devotion, and provides examples of its manifestation in both religious and secular contexts. The inclusion of varying cultural expressions of worship adds nuance and depth to the explanation. While the response lacks the specific emphasis on honoring, praising, and obeying God as outlined in the reference answer, it demonstrates a broad understanding of the concept within a Christian worldview."
