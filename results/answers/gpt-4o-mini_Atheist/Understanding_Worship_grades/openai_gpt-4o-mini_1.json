  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good general understanding of the concept of worship but falls short in the context of a Christian worldview. Given the concern provided, the focus should have been more on worship as it pertains specifically to honoring, praising, and obeying God. The response did not adequately capture the reverence, adoration, and devotion that should be central to worship in a Christian's life. In a Christian worldview, worship is not just about respecting or admiring something of value but rather about the intimate relationship with and devotion to God."
