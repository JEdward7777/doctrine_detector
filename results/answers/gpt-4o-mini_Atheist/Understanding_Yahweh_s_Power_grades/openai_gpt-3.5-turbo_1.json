It effectively addresses the concern by explaining how this declaration signifies God's all-powerful nature and sovereignty, emphasizing the importance of His commands and promises. The integration of Christian worldview principles, such as God's eternal nature and faithfulness to His covenants, enhances the discussion of the nature of God's authority and the implications of His commands."
