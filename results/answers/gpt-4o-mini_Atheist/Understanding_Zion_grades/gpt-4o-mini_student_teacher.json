  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that delves into the various contexts and significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion,\" the answer strays away from the key concern of understanding the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people. The answer focuses more on the historical, cultural, and theological contexts surrounding the term, rather than directly addressing the core concern. Additionally, there is a lack of emphasis on God's specific affection and care for His people, which is the central aspect highlighted in the reference answer. The student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of the term's significance but falls short in fully addressing the concern provided."
