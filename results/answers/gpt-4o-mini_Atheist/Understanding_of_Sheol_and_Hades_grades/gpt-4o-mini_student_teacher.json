  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the Bible, showcasing a good understanding of the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death. The answer effectively highlights the cultural context, moral implications, and the development of doctrine related to these concepts. However, the student's explanation was slightly more detailed and broader in scope compared to the reference answer, which is why the grade is slightly lower. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a strong grasp of the topic."
