  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response provides a clear and concise overview of the differences between Sheol and Hades, highlighting their evolution over time from a neutral place to a more morally charged realm that distinguishes between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the moral implications of each concept, particularly in the New Testament.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the conclusion, which could be strengthened by drawing out the implications of the distinction between Sheol and Hades for understanding the afterlife. Additionally, some minor points of clarification (e.g., defining \"Abraham's bosom\" or \"paradise\") might enhance the overall clarity and effectiveness of the response.\n\nWell-done!"
