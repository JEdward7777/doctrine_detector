The answer effectively addresses the concern by clearly differentiating how Sheol and Hades are perceived over time, particularly in relation to the distinction between the destinies of the righteous and unrighteous. The analysis is thorough, well-supported with biblical references, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
