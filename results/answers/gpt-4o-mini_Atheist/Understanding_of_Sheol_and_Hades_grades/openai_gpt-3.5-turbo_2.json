It effectively demonstrates the evolution of these concepts over time and highlights the moral implications associated with each. The response successfully addresses the concern by clearly outlining how Hades, particularly in the New Testament, becomes associated primarily with the unrighteous, contrasting with the place of comfort for the righteous."
