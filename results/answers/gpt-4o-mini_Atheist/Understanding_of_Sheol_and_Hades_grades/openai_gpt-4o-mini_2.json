  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the concepts of Sheol and Hades, highlighting their development and evolving meanings in biblical context. It effectively addresses the concern about the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death by discussing the neutral nature of Sheol and the moral implications associated with Hades in the New Testament. The response is well-researched, clear, and demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian worldview on the afterlife."
