  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer on the role of Jesus Christ as the 'cornerstone' in the context of the Assembly of believers. They effectively outlined key aspects such as Jesus being the foundation of faith, the unifying force, the guide for conduct, the source of spiritual life, and the authority for doctrine. The student supported their points with relevant biblical references and integrated the importance of Jesus into the functioning of the Church community. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique theological significance of Jesus Christ as the cornerstone in Christian doctrine and salvation, which would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
