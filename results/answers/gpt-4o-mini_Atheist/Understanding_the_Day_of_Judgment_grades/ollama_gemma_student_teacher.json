  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of Jesus Christ being appointed as the judge on the Day of Judgment from a Christian theological perspective. \n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the theological implications, emphasizing the balance of justice and mercy, addressing the cultural and historical context, and discussing interfaith dialogue. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific aspect of Jesus' sinlessness and its relevance to his judgment, as per the reference answer."
