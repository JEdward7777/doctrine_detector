It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of being chosen by God in one's faith journey as being set apart for holiness and bearing good spiritual fruit. The only minor improvement could be further emphasizing the transformative nature of being chosen by God and the impact it should have on one's faith and actions."
