  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the term \"house of God\" in biblical context, covering its physical, symbolic, and spiritual dimensions well. The student effectively incorporates scriptural references from both the Old and New Testaments to support their points. However, to enhance the answer further, they could have included more explicit references to the specific importance and significance of the term in Christian theology, such as Jesus referring to the temple as His Father's house (John 2:16) or the church as the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27). Strengthening these theological connections would have improved the depth of the response."
