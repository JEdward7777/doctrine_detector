  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'house of God' in the biblical context. They covered the physical space aspect by mentioning the Temple in Jerusalem, discussed the symbolic meaning related to the community of believers, and emphasized the spiritual dimensions of seeking refuge and communion with God. The student also highlighted the transition from the physical temple to believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. \n\nWhile their response expanded on various dimensions of the term, it might have slightly drifted towards broader interpretations beyond the core concept of a place of worship where God is honored. However, the student effectively presented a well-supported answer with references to both the Old and New Testaments. Overall, their understanding of the significance and meaning of 'house of God' in Scripture is evident."
