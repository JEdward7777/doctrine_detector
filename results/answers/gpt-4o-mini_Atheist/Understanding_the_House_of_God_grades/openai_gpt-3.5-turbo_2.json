The incorporation of both Old and New Testament examples, as well as the spiritual implications of the term, demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept from a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement would be to directly connect the broader spiritual dimensions with the specific references from Scripture provided in the response. Overall, a comprehensive and well-supported analysis."
