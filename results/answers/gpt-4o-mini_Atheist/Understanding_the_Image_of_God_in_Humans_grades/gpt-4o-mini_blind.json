  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70/100\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of characteristics associated with the biblical concept of humans being created in the image of God. The answer covers various aspects such as rationality, creativity, morality, relational capacity, spirituality, free will, and emotional depth. However, the student could enhance their answer by explicitly connecting each characteristic to specific biblical passages or theological concepts to strengthen the doctrinal foundation of their response. Additionally, it is important to emphasize that these qualities are not just \"attributes\" that humans possess, but rather they are reflections of God's own nature embedded in humanity. Encouraging the student to deepen the biblical basis for each point would improve the overall doctrinal correctness of the response."
