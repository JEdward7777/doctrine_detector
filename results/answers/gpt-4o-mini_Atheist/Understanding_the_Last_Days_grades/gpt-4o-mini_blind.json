  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer at 85.\n\nThe answer provides a solid overview of the significance of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings from a Christian perspective. It correctly highlights the fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus' first coming and the expectation of his return in the second coming to establish God's kingdom and bring final judgment. The explanation is clear and informative, demonstrating a good understanding of Christian eschatology.\n\nHowever, I would deduct some points for lacking in-depth biblical references or specific doctrinal teachings that could further strengthen the argument. Including scriptural passages or references to key theological concepts related to the \"last days\" would have elevated the response.\n\nOverall, the answer shows a strong grasp of the topic but could benefit from more depth and specificity to enhance its doctrinal correctness."
