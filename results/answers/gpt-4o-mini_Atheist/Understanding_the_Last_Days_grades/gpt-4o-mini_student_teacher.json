  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings, the response somewhat deviates from the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student correctly identifies the \"last days\" as a period leading up to the final judgment but introduces additional theological perspectives and interpretations that are not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer. While the student's insights are well-reasoned and offer valuable perspectives, the concern specified emphasizes the importance of understanding major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith. The student's response, though informative, could have been more directly aligned with the specific concern provided. Thus, the grade reflects a solid understanding of the topic with room for improvement in directly addressing the concern."
