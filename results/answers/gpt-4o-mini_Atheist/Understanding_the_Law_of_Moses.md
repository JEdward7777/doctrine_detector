1. **The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17)**:
   - No other gods before Me.
   - No graven images.
   - Do not take the Lord's name in vain.
   - Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
   - Honor your father and mother.
   - Do not murder.
   - Do not commit adultery.
   - Do not steal.

   - Love your neighbor as yourself (Leviticus 19:18).
   - Do not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your people (Leviticus 19:18).
