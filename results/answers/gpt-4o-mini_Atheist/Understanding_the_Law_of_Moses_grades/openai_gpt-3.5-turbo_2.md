The Law of Moses, often referred to as the Torah, encompasses a wide range of commandments and instructions given to the Israelites. The core commandments are often summarized in the Ten Commandments, but there are many additional laws as well. Here are some specific commandments from the broader corpus of the Law of Moses:

1. **The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17)**:
   - No other gods before Me.
   - No graven images.
   - Do not take the Lord's name in vain.
   - Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
   - Honor your father and mother.
   - Do not murder.
   - Do not commit adultery.
   - Do not steal.
   - Do not bear false witness against your neighbor.
   - Do not covet your neighbor's house, wife, or possessions.

2. **Ceremonial Laws**:
   - Instructions regarding the sacrificial system, including types of sacrifices (e.g., burnt offerings, peace offerings) found in Leviticus.
   - Laws concerning clean and unclean animals (Leviticus 11).

3. **Moral and Ethical Laws**:
   - Do not oppress the foreigner, orphan, or widow (Exodus 22:22).
   - Love your neighbor as yourself (Leviticus 19:18).
   - Do not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your people (Leviticus 19:18).

4. **Social Laws**:
   - Regulations about property rights, such as restitution for theft (Exodus 22:1).
   - Laws regarding debt and the treatment of slaves (Exodus 21).

5. **Health and Hygiene Laws**:
   - Laws about purification after childbirth (Leviticus 12).
   - Laws concerning leprosy and skin diseases (Leviticus 13-14).

6. **Religious Observances**:
   - Commandments regarding the feasts of Passover, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Weeks (Shavuot), Trumpets, Atonement (Yom Kippur), and Tabernacles (Sukkot) (Leviticus 23).

7. **Judicial and Legal Laws**:
   - Instructions for the establishment of courts and the pursuit of justice (Deuteronomy 16:18-20).
