# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The name "Yahweh" is significant in the context of the Old Testament as it is understood to represent the personal name of the God of Israel. It is derived from the Hebrew verb "to be," suggesting ideas of existence, presence, and faithfulness. This name is often associated with God's covenantal relationship with the people of Israel.

In the Old Testament, particularly in the Torah, Yahweh is depicted as the creator, sustainer, and liberator, who actively engages with humanity and particularly with Israel. The name is closely connected to the revelations made to figures such as Moses, particularly in the story of the burning bush (Exodus 3:14), where God declares "I AM WHO I AM," linking the name to themes of being and self-existence.

Yahweh is also central to the theological narrative of the Old Testament, emphasizing a God who is both transcendent and immanent, who desires a relationship with His people characterized by faithfulness and obedience. The name is considered sacred, leading to its substitution with titles like "Adonai" (Lord) in Jewish practice, reflecting a deep reverence for the divine presence encapsulated in the name Yahweh.
