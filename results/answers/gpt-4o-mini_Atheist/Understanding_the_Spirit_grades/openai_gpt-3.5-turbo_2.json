  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the distinction between the human spirit and evil spirits as presented in the Bible. It effectively clarifies the difference between personal spiritual identity and malevolent spiritual influences, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be further emphasizing the personal aspect of the human spirit in relation to one's connection to God, but overall, the response is well-written and insightful."
