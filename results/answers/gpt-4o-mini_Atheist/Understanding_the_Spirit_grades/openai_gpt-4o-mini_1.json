  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and detailed explanation of the distinction between the human spirit and evil spirits according to a Christian worldview. The analysis accurately reflects biblical teachings on these concepts and effectively addresses the concern regarding the differentiation between personal spiritual identity and malevolent spiritual influences. Great job in incorporating relevant biblical references to support the discussion."
