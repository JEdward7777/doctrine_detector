## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The title "Son of Man" in the context of Jesus' identity carries significant theological and cultural implications. Originating from the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the book of Daniel, "Son of Man" is associated with a figure who has authority, is representative of humanity, and is linked with eschatological themes. 

In the Gospels, Jesus uses this title frequently, which suggests multiple layers of meaning:

1. **Humanity**: The term emphasizes Jesus' connection to humanity, highlighting his role as a relatable figure who experiences human emotions and suffering. This connection reinforces the idea of the Incarnation—God becoming human.

2. **Prophetic Identity**: In the context of Second Temple Judaism, the "Son of Man" could be interpreted as a prophetic or messianic figure. Jesus' use of the title might have been a way to assert his role in fulfilling these prophetic expectations.

3. **Suffering Servant**: The title can also relate to themes of suffering and sacrifice, aligning with the idea of the "suffering servant" found in Isaiah. This suggests that Jesus, as the "Son of Man," embraces suffering for the sake of humanity.

4. **Authority**: In the Danielic vision, the "one like a son of man" approaches God and is given authority over nations. By using this title, Jesus indicates his unique authority and role in God's plan for redemption.

Overall, the title "Son of Man" serves to encapsulate the dual nature of Jesus as both divine and human, a leader and a servant, fulfilling Jewish messianic expectations while also redefining them within the context of his mission and ministry. The term invites both exploration and debate among scholars, theologians, and practitioners, making it a rich area of study within the broader narrative of Jesus' identity.
