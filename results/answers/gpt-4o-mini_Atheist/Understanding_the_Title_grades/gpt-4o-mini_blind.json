  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 85. The response provides a solid explanation of the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus' identity, touching on important theological aspects such as Jesus' humanity, prophetic identity, suffering servant role, and authority. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of this title in both the Hebrew Bible and the Gospels. However, to improve, the student could have delved deeper into the doctrinal implications of Jesus' use of the title \"Son of Man\" and its connection to His divinity. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references could have strengthened the answer."
