  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85. The student provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus' identity, covering multiple dimensions such as Jesus' humanity, prophetic identity, suffering servant role, and authority. The student effectively connects these aspects to theological themes and the broader narrative of Jesus' mission and ministry. However, the student could improve their answer by more directly aligning with the reference answer provided by emphasizing the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine, which is a key aspect of the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in Christian theology."
