  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive exploration of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" in both theological and cultural contexts, delving into the themes of humanity, prophetic identity, suffering, and authority. It effectively elucidates how this title encapsulates Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity. The analysis is thorough and presents a solid understanding of the implications of Jesus' use of this title for our faith. The response could be further enhanced by explicitly connecting the discussion to the broader narrative of Jesus' identity in Christian theology. Overall, a strong and insightful reflection from a Christian worldview."
