However, from a Christian worldview, it is crucial to emphasize that the ultimate consequence of ungodliness is eternal separation from God and eternal judgment in hell for those who do not repent and believe in Jesus Christ. This aspect is foundational to Christian doctrine and should be highlighted more clearly in the answer. The response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the importance of repentance, redemption through Jesus Christ, and the eternal consequences of rejecting God's salvation."
