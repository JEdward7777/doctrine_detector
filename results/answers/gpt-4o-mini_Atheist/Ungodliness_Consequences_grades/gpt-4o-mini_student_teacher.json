  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the potential consequences of ungodly behavior across various religious traditions, showing a good understanding of the topic. However, the student's answer lacks a clear focus on the Christian perspective specifically, as the reference answer emphasizes God's judgment and wrath on those who reject Him. A higher grade could be achieved by integrating more direct references to biblical teachings on the consequences of living in disobedience to God within a Christian worldview."
