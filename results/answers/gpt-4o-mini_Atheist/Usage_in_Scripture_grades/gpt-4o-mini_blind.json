  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound overview of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively explains the various contexts in which the term is used, accurately referencing key verses and illustrating the significance of the term in relation to God, Jesus, believers, and prophets. The inclusion of both Old and New Testament examples, along with the summary tying everything together, demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Well done!"
