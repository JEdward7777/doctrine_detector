However, the student could have strengthened their answer by focusing more on the specific concern of exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament. The reference answer highlights the centrality of Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament, which the student's response touched upon but could have emphasized more explicitly. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in tying the discussion back more explicitly to Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament."
