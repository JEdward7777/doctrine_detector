## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
The term "Holy One" appears in various contexts in both the Old and New Testaments, often referring to God or individuals endowed with a special holiness. Here are some significant contexts for its use:

### Old Testament

1. **Refers to God**: The term "Holy One" is frequently used to describe God Himself, emphasizing His purity, separateness from sin, and transcendence. For example:
   - **Isaiah 1:4**: "Alas, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the Lord, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are utterly estranged."
   - **Psalm 30:4**: "Sing praises to the Lord, O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name."

2. **Refers to Israel**: The term can also apply to Israel as a nation to denote its covenant relationship with God, who has set them apart.
   - **Isaiah 43:15**: "I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King."

3. **Refers to Prophets or Messengers**: At times, the term can refer to individuals who have a special role in God’s plan, often emphasizing their mission or God’s empowerment of them.
   - **Psalm 16:10**: "For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption."

### New Testament

1. **Refers to Jesus**: In the New Testament, "Holy One" is primarily used to describe Jesus Christ, emphasizing His divine nature and sinlessness.
   - **Acts 3:14**: “But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you.”
   - **Luke 1:35**: “The angel answered her, ‘The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God.’”

2. **Refers to Believers**: The term can also be used in a broader sense to refer to believers in Christ, emphasizing their calling to holiness as a result of their relationship with God.
   - **1 Peter 2:9**: “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession…”

3. **Refers to the Holy Spirit**: Although this is less directly connected with the term "Holy One," the references to the Holy Spirit in the New Testament highlight the aspect of holiness in the Christian understanding of God's presence and working in the world.
   - **Matthew 12:32**: "And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven."

### Summary

The term "Holy One" serves to convey different layers of meaning within the biblical text. Primarily, it denotes God's holiness and separateness from sin while also referring to individuals marked by holiness due to their relationship with God. The context determines whether it refers specifically to God, Jesus, believers, or prophets.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-organized answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the term "Holy One" in both the Old and New Testaments, touching on various contexts and providing relevant biblical references. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by focusing more on the specific concern of exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament. The reference answer highlights the centrality of Jesus as the "Holy One" in the New Testament, which the student's response touched upon but could have emphasized more explicitly. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in tying the discussion back more explicitly to Jesus as the "Holy One" in the New Testament.
