They provide clear examples from scripture to support their points. However, the response could be improved by elaborating on the significance of the term \"Holy One of Israel\" in the Old Testament and its connection to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Additionally, the student could provide more explicit commentary on the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament references to the \"Holy One.\""
