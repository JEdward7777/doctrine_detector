  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern about exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, but it does not fully engage with this topic. While the response correctly notes that \"Holy One\" is used to specifically refer to Jesus in the New Testament, it fails to delve deeper into how this title reveals Jesus' divine nature and authority. The response instead focuses on providing a general overview of the term's usage throughout both testaments.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could have explored specific passages that demonstrate Jesus' divinity and authority as the \"Holy One,\" such as those mentioned in the New Testament examples provided (e.g., Acts 3:14, Luke 1:35)."
