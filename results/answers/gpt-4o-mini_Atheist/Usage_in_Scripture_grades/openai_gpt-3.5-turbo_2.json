It effectively demonstrates how the term is used to convey different layers of meaning within the biblical context. The mention of Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament aligns well with the concern about exploring his authority and divinity, offering a clear connection to his divine nature and sinlessness as emphasized in scriptural references. A minor improvement could be a more explicit connection made between the authority and divinity of Jesus and how his designation as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament supports this aspect of Christian belief."
