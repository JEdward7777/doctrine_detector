  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of how myrrh was used in biblical times in the context of burial practices, referencing specific biblical events and traditions. The student effectively connects the significance of myrrh as a symbol of mourning and a means of honoring the deceased. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the cultural and symbolic importance of myrrh in burial practices during biblical times. The only minor improvement could be to directly tie the response back to how recognizing these burial customs enhances comprehension of cultural contexts in scripture."
