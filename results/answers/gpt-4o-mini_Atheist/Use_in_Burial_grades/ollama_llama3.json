  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response clearly addresses the concern by recognizing the customs surrounding burial practices in biblical times, specifically highlighting the importance of myrrh in preparing dead bodies for burial. The example from the New Testament and Jesus' burial are effectively used to illustrate its significance.\n\nThe response also goes beyond simply restating the answer, providing additional context and insight into the cultural significance of myrrh. The description of Jewish tradition and the use of myrrh as a symbol of mourning and respect for the deceased adds depth to the understanding of the custom.\n\nOne area for improvement would be to further explore the biblical significance of myrrh beyond its role in burial practices. While the response mentions its association with Jesus' death and burial, it could delve deeper into how this might relate to broader themes or symbolism in scripture. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the customs surrounding burial practices and their relevance to scriptural interpretation.\n\nComment: This response effectively addresses the concern by providing a detailed explanation of myrrh's importance in biblical times. While there is room for further development, it provides a solid foundation for understanding the cultural context of scripture."
