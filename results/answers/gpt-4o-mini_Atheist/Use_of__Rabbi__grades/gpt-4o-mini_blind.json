The discussion on Jesus being referred to as 'Rabbi' by his disciples is also well explained. However, the answer could be improved by highlighting the significance of Jesus being regarded as more than just a Rabbi, but as the Son of God and the Messiah in Christian belief. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding from a Christian worldview."
