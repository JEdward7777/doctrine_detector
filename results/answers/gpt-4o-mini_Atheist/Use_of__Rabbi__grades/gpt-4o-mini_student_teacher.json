  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student accurately discussed the roles of John the Baptist and Jesus in relation to the title 'Rabbi' and highlighted the significance of their teachings. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly stating that both figures were sometimes called 'Rabbi' by their disciples, as indicated in the reference answer. This direct comparison would have further emphasized the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings within a Christian worldview."
