It correctly highlights the significance of the title 'Rabbi' in reflecting their roles as teachers, while also acknowledging the importance of cultural and historical contexts. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly mentioning the divine authority with which Jesus taught, as Christians believe in his role as the Son of God."
