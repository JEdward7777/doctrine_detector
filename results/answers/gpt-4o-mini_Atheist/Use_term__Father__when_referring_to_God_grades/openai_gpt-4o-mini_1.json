While it suggests using more neutral terms for inclusivity, it lacks a strong emphasis on the importance of upholding the biblical and theological significance of God as Father. It would have been beneficial to emphasize that teaching and clarifying the scriptural basis for God as Father can address concerns without completely avoiding the term. Maintaining the scriptural message and theological accuracy should be paramount, even in the face of cultural sensitivities."
