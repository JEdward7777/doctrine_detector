## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Jesus used several parables to convey the value of the Kingdom of God, highlighting its importance and the transformative impact it can have on individuals and communities. Here are a few notable ones:

1. **The Parable of the Hidden Treasure (Matthew 13:44)**: In this parable, Jesus compares the Kingdom of God to a treasure hidden in a field. When a person finds it, they joyfully sell everything they own to buy the field, emphasizing that the Kingdom is worth more than all earthly possessions.

2. **The Parable of the Pearl of Great Value (Matthew 13:45-46)**: Similar to the treasure, this parable describes a merchant searching for fine pearls. Upon finding one of extraordinary value, he sells everything he has to purchase it. This illustrates the idea that the Kingdom is supremely valuable and worthy of sacrifice.

3. **The Parable of the Mustard Seed (Matthew 13:31-32)**: Jesus likens the Kingdom of God to a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds but grows into a large tree. This parable demonstrates how something seemingly insignificant can grow into something large and impactful, representing the expansive growth of the Kingdom.

4. **The Parable of the Yeast (Matthew 13:33)**: In this parable, Jesus compares the Kingdom to yeast that a woman mixes into a large amount of flour until it is all leavened. This illustrates how the Kingdom can permeate and transform an entire community or society.

5. **The Parable of the Great Banquet (Luke 14:15-24)**: Here, Jesus tells of a host who invites many guests to a banquet, but they make excuses to decline. This parable emphasizes the inclusive nature of the Kingdom of God and its invitation to all, regardless of social status or circumstances.

These parables collectively highlight the value, transformative power, and inclusive nature of the Kingdom of God, prompting listeners to reflect on their priorities and the sacrifices they might need to make to be part of it.
