The explanations are clear and align well with Christian doctrine. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, it could have been beneficial to include more scriptural references or direct quotations from the parables themselves. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the theological significance or implications of each parable would have further deepened the analysis. Overall, a solid and well-informed response."
