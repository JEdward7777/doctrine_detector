However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the centrality of Jesus Christ as the ultimate victor over Satan, as outlined in Christian doctrine. Additionally, a clearer connection between the defeat of Satan and the salvation accomplished through Jesus would enhance doctrinal correctness. Further elaboration on the ultimate defeat of Satan in light of Christ's victory would strengthen the response."
