## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
Throughout various religious texts, particularly in the Christian tradition, there are promises regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan. In the Book of Revelation, for example, it is suggested that there will be a final confrontation between good and evil, culminating in the defeat of Satan and his forces. Revelation 20:10 describes this defeat, stating that the devil will be thrown into the lake of fire, symbolizing a permanent end to his influence.

Additionally, in the Book of Genesis, there's a passage often referred to as the "protoevangelium," found in Genesis 3:15. Here, it is interpreted that God promises a future victory over the serpent, often associated with Satan, through the coming of a savior.

Overall, these texts convey a theme of hope and eventual triumph of good over evil, reflecting a moral framework that is important in many religious and ethical discussions. Understanding these promises can offer insight into the cultural and theological perspectives surrounding the concepts of good, evil, and redemption.
