However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the foundational Christian belief that through his sacrificial death, Jesus defeated Satan and broke his dominion over humanity. The doctrinal perspective on the significance of Jesus' atoning sacrifice for the defeat of Satan could have been more explicitly stated. Additionally, there could have been more emphasis on the biblical basis for these interpretations, as Christian theology ultimately relies on Scripture as the authority for understanding these concepts."
