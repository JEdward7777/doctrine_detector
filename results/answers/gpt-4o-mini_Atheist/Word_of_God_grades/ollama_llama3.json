  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately captures the multifaceted nature of the term \"Word of God\" and mentions several key aspects, including divine revelation, scripture, Jesus Christ, and proclamation/teaching. It also acknowledges that the Word can be both written (scriptures) and spoken (prophets and apostles). Additionally, it highlights the importance of understanding the scope and significance of God's communication to humanity.\n\nHowever, I would dock a few points because the response does not fully explore the concept of the \"Living Word\" aspect, which is an important part of Christian theology. The answer also could benefit from more specific biblical references and examples to support its claims. Nonetheless, overall, this is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a good understanding of the term \"Word of God.\""
