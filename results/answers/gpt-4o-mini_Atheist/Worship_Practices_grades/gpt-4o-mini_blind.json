It highlights various societal trends and priorities that can lead individuals away from a spiritual focus. The examples given are relevant and well-explained within a Christian worldview. The response could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the need for repentance and turning back to God as the solution to idolatry, in line with Christian doctrine. Furthermore, tying each example back to relevant Bible verses or theological principles would strengthen the response even more."
