However, it lacks emphasis on the exclusive worship of the true God as mandated by Scripture and downplays the severe consequences of idolatry. It could benefit from a more robust explanation of the foundational importance of worshiping the one true God and the inherent sinfulness and spiritual implications of worshiping false gods."
