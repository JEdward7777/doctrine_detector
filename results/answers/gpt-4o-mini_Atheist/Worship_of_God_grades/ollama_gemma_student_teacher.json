  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical perspective on the purpose of worship and the dangers of idolatry. The student provides relevant scriptural references and explains the consequences of false worship. The response also acknowledges the cultural significance of worship and offers a broader perspective beyond traditional monotheism. However, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the idea of worshipping the true God to the student's initial concern about avoiding idolatry in everyday life."
