  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer on the concept of zeal in Christian teachings. They accurately discussed the enthusiasm and fervor for God, faith, and good works that zeal entails, and supported their points with relevant biblical references. Additionally, the student highlighted the importance of aligning zeal with God's will, knowledge, wisdom, and humility, which demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical context of zeal. However, the answer could have been improved by directly mentioning the aspect of actively promoting a good cause in line with obeying God, as emphasized in the reference answer."
