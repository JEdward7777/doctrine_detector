## [Answer](../Zeal_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Atheist](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Atheist.md)
In the context of Christian teachings, "zeal" refers to an enthusiastic diligence and fervor for God, faith, and good works. It often embodies a passionate commitment to the principles and practices of Christianity. The concept of zeal can be found throughout the Bible, where it is frequently associated with the idea of living out oneâ€™s faith with energy and intensity.

For instance, in Romans 10:2, the Apostle Paul speaks about having a zeal for God, but notes that it can be misguided if not grounded in knowledge. Similarly, in Revelation 3:19, believers are called to be "zealous" and to repent, indicating that zeal should align with God's will and teachings.

Zeal can also manifest in various ways, such as evangelism, service to others, and a desire for spiritual growth. However, Christian teachings also caution that zeal should be coupled with wisdom and humility, as unchecked zeal can lead to conflict or misdirection. Thus, in Christian thought, zeal is about the passionate pursuit of faith that is both informed and loving.
