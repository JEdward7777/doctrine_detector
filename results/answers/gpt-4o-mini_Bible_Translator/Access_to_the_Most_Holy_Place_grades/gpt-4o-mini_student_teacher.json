They effectively explained the significance of the high priest being the only one permitted to enter the Most Holy Place in recognizing the holiness of God and the protocols for approaching Him. The student also connected this restriction to the symbol of atonement and the foreshadowing of Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity. Overall, a strong understanding and application of Christian principles in their response. Great job!"
