  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response that effectively connects the term 'unfaithful' to the concept of marriage within a Christian worldview. The answer delves into the theological implications of unfaithfulness in marriage, drawing parallels between human relationships and the spiritual relationship between God and His people. While the student covers various aspects, including the covenantal nature of marriage, adultery, spiritual symbolism, and the themes of restoration and forgiveness, the response could have been further strengthened by directly referencing the teacher's answer to establish a closer alignment with the specific concern provided."
