## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover annually as a means of remembering and commemorating their deliverance from slavery in Egypt. According to the Bible, specifically in the book of Exodus (Exodus 12:1-14), the Passover was instituted by God when He executed judgment on Egypt by striking down the firstborn, while sparing the Israelites who marked their doorposts with the blood of a lamb. This act signified God’s protection and deliverance of His people.

The annual celebration served several purposes:

1. **Remembrance of Deliverance**: It was a time for the Israelites to remember how God miraculously freed them from oppression. The celebration served as a vivid reminder of their identity as God's chosen people and the importance of trusting in His provision and power.

2. **Instruction for Future Generations**: The Passover was meant to be a teaching opportunity for parents to explain to their children the significance of the events surrounding the Exodus. In Exodus 12:26-27, it states that when children ask about the meaning of the Passover, parents are to respond by recounting the story of God's deliverance.

3. **Covenant Relationship**: Celebrating Passover reinforced the covenant between God and His people, reminding them of their commitment to obey Him and live in accordance with His laws.

4. **Commemoration of God’s Faithfulness**: By observing this feast each year, the Israelites acknowledged God's faithfulness in their past and His continuous commitment to them as they journeyed through the wilderness and into the Promised Land.

Thus, the regular observance of Passover served both as a profound act of worship and a communal identity for the Israelites, fostering a sense of unity and historical consciousness among the people.
