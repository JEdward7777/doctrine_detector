  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and doctrinally sound explanation of what defines a person as an antichrist according to the apostle John. The student accurately references key passages from 1 John and effectively communicates the biblical criteria for identifying an antichrist. Good job in emphasizing the crucial aspect of denying Christ's identity and relationship with God the Father as the defining characteristic of an antichrist."
