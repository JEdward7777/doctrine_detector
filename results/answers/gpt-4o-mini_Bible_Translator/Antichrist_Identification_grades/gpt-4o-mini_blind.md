## [Answer](../Antichrist_Identification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the writings attributed to the Apostle John, particularly in his First Epistle (1 John 2:18-22), the term "antichrist" is defined in relation to one's beliefs about Jesus Christ. John identifies antichrists as those who deny that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah) and deny the Father and the Son. 

Specifically, in 1 John 2:22, John states: "Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son." Furthermore, the essence of an antichrist is also seen in their teachings and the spirit of opposition to Christ. In 1 John 4:3, John explains that every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God, and this spirit is characterized as the spirit of the antichrist.

Overall, according to John, to be defined as an antichrist is to reject the foundational truths about Christ's identity and His relationship to God the Father.
