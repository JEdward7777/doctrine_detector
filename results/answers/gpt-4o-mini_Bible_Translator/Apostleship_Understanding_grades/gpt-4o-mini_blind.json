  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and doctrinally sound explanation of the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the Gospel. The student effectively addresses key aspects such as the authority and commissioning of the apostles, their foundational role in the Church, their personal experience and witness, empowerment through the Holy Spirit, fulfillment of prophecy, unity and fellowship, and the expansion of the Gospel. The integration of relevant biblical references further strengthens the argument. Well done."
