  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that thoroughly explains the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the Gospel. They have effectively addressed the concern of understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission by examining various key aspects such as authority, foundational role, personal experience, empowerment through the Holy Spirit, fulfillment of prophecy, unity, fellowship, and expansion of the Gospel. The student's response demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic and effectively supports their points with relevant biblical references. However, the teacher's reference answer provides a more concise and focused explanation of the apostles' mission, which could have been emphasized more clearly in the student's response. Overall, the student has provided a strong answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
