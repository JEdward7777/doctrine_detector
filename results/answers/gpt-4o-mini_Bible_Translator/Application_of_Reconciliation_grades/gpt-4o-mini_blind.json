The scriptural references are appropriate and support each point well. The emphasis on forgiveness, seeking peace, humility, and reflecting Christ's love is commendable. The answer could be strengthened by delving deeper into the theological significance of reconciliation in the Christian faith and potentially including more practical examples of how these principles can be applied in real-life situations. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
