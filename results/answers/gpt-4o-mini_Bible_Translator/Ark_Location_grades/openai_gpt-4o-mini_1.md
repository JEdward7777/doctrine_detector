## [Answer](../Ark_Location.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant was located in the Most Holy Place (also known as the Holy of Holies). This was the innermost chamber of the Tabernacle, separated from the outer chamber (the Holy Place) by a veil. The Ark of the Covenant, which contained the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna, was placed on a pedestal known as the mercy seat, where God's presence was believed to dwell. Only the High Priest was allowed to enter the Most Holy Place, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for the sins of the people. This setup is detailed in the books of Exodus and Leviticus in the Old Testament.
