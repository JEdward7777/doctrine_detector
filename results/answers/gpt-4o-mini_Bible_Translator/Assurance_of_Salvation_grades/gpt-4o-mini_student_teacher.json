  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-supported answer, citing various Bible verses to illustrate the assurances given to believers in Jesus. The only discrepancy from the reference answer is the additional details and explanations provided by the student, which while informative, slightly deviate from the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
