## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible addresses the authority of governing rulers in several passages, emphasizing their role as appointed by God and the responsibilities of citizens toward them. Here are some key scriptures that reflect these themes:

1. **Romans 13:1-7**: This passage is one of the clearest affirmations of governmental authority. It states that every person should be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. Rulers are described as Godâ€™s servants, and they bear the sword to punish wrongdoers. Therefore, Christians are encouraged to obey laws and respect authorities.

2. **1 Peter 2:13-17**: Peter instructs believers to submit to every human authority for the Lord's sake, whether to the emperor or to governors. This submission is framed as a way to honor God and promote good conduct among those outside the faith.

3. **Proverbs 8:15-16**: Wisdom is depicted as having a role in leadership, proclaiming that it is by her that kings reign and rulers make just decrees. This suggests that the moral integrity of rulers is important in maintaining their authority.

4. **Jeremiah 29:7**: In this verse, God instructs the exiles in Babylon to seek the welfare of the city and pray for it, indicating that they should support and engage positively with their authorities, as the welfare of the city affects their own welfare.

5. **Matthew 22:21**: When Jesus is asked about paying taxes, He responds, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." This emphasizes the distinction between secular and spiritual responsibilities but also underlines the legitimacy of governmental authority.

While the Bible clearly establishes that governing authorities have a role given by God, it also does not support unqualified obedience. When authorities command actions that contradict God's commands, believers are called to obey God rather than men (Acts 5:29). Ultimately, the call for Christians is to respect and submit to authorities while maintaining fidelity to God's word and moral standards.
