The inclusion of relevant scriptures and explanations was commendable. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the teacher's reference answer, which focused on the specific affirmation of governing rulers being established by God as outlined in Romans 13:1-2. Acknowledging this main point more prominently would have strengthened the response."
