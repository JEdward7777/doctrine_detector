  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation supported by multiple relevant biblical passages that address the authority of governing rulers and the responsibilities of individuals towards them. It effectively addresses the concern regarding understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and obedience to it from a Christian perspective. The use of various scriptures to support the points made enhances the credibility of the response. The only slight room for improvement could be a more explicit reference to the importance of discerning when to obey God rather than human authorities, as mentioned in Acts 5:29, to further strengthen the argument. Overall, a very strong and well-articulated response in line with a Christian worldview."
