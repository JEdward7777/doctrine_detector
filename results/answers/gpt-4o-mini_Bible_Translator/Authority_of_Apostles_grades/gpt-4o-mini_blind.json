The student effectively connects the apostles' authority to their commissioning by Jesus and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, supported by relevant Biblical references. The explanation is clear, cohesive, and aligns well with Christian beliefs regarding the role of the apostles in spreading the Gospel. Well done!"
