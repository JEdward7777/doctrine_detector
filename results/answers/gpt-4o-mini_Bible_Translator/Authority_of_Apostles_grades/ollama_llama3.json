  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, as specified in the concern. It correctly highlights the connection between the apostles' commissioning by Jesus Christ and their empowerment by the Holy Spirit. The response also effectively demonstrates how the miracles performed by the apostles served as a validation of their message and authority.\n\nThe only areas where this response could improve are:\n\n* A slight lack of clarity in some sentences, which can make it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.\n* No explicit mention of the significance of Jesus' resurrection in granting the apostles their authority (although it is implied).\n* The response does not specifically address any potential counterarguments or criticisms that might be raised about the apostles' authority.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a thorough and biblical exploration of the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry."
