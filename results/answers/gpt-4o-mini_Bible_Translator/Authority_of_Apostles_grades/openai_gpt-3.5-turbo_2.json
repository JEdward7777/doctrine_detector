The explanation of the apostles' authority being rooted in their commissioning by Jesus and empowerment by the Holy Spirit is thorough and supported well with scriptural evidence. The emphasis on miracles as confirmation of their message and the boldness in preaching further reinforces the significance of their authority. The response effectively highlights the integral connection between divine commissioning, empowerment, and the apostles' mission in spreading the Gospel. Well done!"
