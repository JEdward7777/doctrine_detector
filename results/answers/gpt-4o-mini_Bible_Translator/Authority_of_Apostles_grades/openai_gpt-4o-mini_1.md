## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The authority of the apostles is intrinsically linked to their commissioning by Jesus Christ and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. This divine authority is reflected in several key aspects:

1. **Commissioning by Jesus**: After His resurrection, Jesus commissioned the apostles to spread the Gospel (Matthew 28:18-20). This Great Commission granted them the authority to preach and teach in His name, establishing them as His representatives. Their ability to perform miracles can be seen as a sign of this authority and the divine backing of their message.

2. **Empowerment of the Holy Spirit**: On the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2), the apostles received the Holy Spirit, which emboldened them to preach the Gospel and perform miracles. The Holy Spirit's empowerment is often seen as a crucial factor in enabling the apostles to operate with such confidence and authority (Acts 1:8).

3. **Miracles as Confirmation of the Message**: The miracles performed by the apostles served a dual purpose: they demonstrated God's power and purpose, and they validated their message as being from God. In Acts 2:43 and Acts 5:12, miracles were both a tool of evangelism and a confirmation of their authority.

4. **Boldness in Preaching**: The apostles exhibited remarkable boldness in their preaching, even in the face of persecution (Acts 4:29-31). Their understanding of the resurrection of Christ and the reality of their experience with Him fortified their conviction and courage. Their authority, derived from their relationship with Christ and the Spirit's empowerment, inspired them to speak boldly about the truth of the Gospel.

In summary, the authority of the apostles is not merely a matter of title but is deeply rooted in their divine commissioning and empowerment. This authority manifested in their ability to perform miracles and preach with boldness, effectively carrying out the mission given to them by Christ. This relationship indicates that their work and the accompanying signs were meant to foster faith in Christ and establish the early Church.
