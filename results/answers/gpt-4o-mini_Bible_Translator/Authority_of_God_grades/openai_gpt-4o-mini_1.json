The answer effectively addresses the concern by articulating how understanding God's authority as depicted in this title can deepen faith and trust in His omnipotence. The analysis is thorough, well-articulated, and aligns closely with Christian teachings on God's authority and role as the ruler of both heavenly and earthly realms. Great job!"
