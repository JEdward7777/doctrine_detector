  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of how the title \"King of the Jews\" illustrates Jesus' authority over all creation from a Christian worldview. The student effectively integrates scriptural references, theological concepts, and doctrinal understanding to support their points. The answer could be further strengthened by deepening the discussion on the atonement and its implications for Jesus' authority as King. Overall, this is a strong and doctrinally sound response."
