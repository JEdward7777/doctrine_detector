  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and thorough examination of the theological significance of Jesus being referred to as the \"King of the Jews,\" illustrating His authority over all creation. The analysis effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding Jesus' authority can lead believers to acknowledge His sovereignty in their lives. The response is well-supported with biblical references and demonstrates a strong Christian worldview perspective. Great job overall."
