## [Answer](../Authority_of_Parents.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Biblical basis for parental authority over children can be found in several scriptures that emphasize the responsibilities and roles of parents within the family structure. Here are some key verses that highlight this concept:

1. **Ephesians 6:1-4 (NIV)** - "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—which is the first commandment with a promise—'so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.' Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord." This passage establishes the principle of children obeying their parents, underscoring parental authority while also highlighting the responsibility of parents to nurture and guide their children.

2. **Proverbs 22:6 (NIV)** - "Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it." This proverb emphasizes the role of parents in teaching and guiding their children in the right path, reflecting the authority and responsibility entrusted to parents.

3. **Colossians 3:20-21 (NIV)** - "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged." Similar to Ephesians, this passage reiterates the call for children to obey their parents, while also warning parents to lead with care and understanding.

4. **Deuteronomy 6:6-7 (NIV)** - "These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up." This scripture highlights the importance of parents teaching their children about God's commandments and instills a strong sense of parental authority in spiritual matters.

5. **Exodus 20:12 (NIV)** - "'Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.'" This commandment not only recognizes the authority of parents but also attaches a promise to the honoring of that authority.

These verses together create a framework that establishes and affirms the authority of parents over their children within a Biblical context, emphasizing both the guidance and the responsibility that comes with that authority.
