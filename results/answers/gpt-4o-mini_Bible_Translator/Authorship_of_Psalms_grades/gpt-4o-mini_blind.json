  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate overview of key figures traditionally associated with writing the Psalms. It correctly identifies prominent authors such as David, Asaph, Sons of Korah, Solomon, Moses, Heman, and Ethan, along with acknowledging the presence of anonymous authors. The inclusion of specific Psalms attributed to each figure shows a good level of detail and understanding. Excellent job overall in covering the diverse authorship of the Psalms within a Christian worldview."
