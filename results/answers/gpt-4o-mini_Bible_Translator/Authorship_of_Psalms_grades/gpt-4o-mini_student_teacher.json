  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of key figures involved in writing the Psalms, which aligns well with the reference answer. However, the student included additional details about the Sons of Korah, Heman, Ethan, and anonymous authors, which while informative, slightly detracts from the focus on the main key figures. Overall, a strong answer demonstrating a good understanding of the authorship of Psalms, earning a solid grade."
