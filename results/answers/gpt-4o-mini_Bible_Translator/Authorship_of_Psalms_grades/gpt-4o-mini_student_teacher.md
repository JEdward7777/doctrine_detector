1. **David**: King David is attributed as the primary author of many of the Psalms, with a significant number of them directly linked to his life experiences and spiritual reflections.

2. **Asaph**: Asaph was a Levite and one of the leaders of David's choir. Several Psalms (specifically Psalms 73–83) are attributed to him and his descendants.

3. **Sons of Korah**: This group, descended from Korah, is credited with writing several Psalms (such as Psalms 42, 44–49, 84, 85, and 87).

4. **Solomon**: Some Psalms are attributed to King Solomon, particularly Psalm 72 and Psalm 127, reflecting his wisdom and reign.

5. **Moses**: Psalm 90 is attributed to Moses, marking it as one of the oldest Psalms in the collection.

6. **Heman and Ethan**: These figures are associated with a few Psalms as well. Psalm 88 is attributed to Heman the Ezrahite, and Psalm 89 is attributed to Ethan the Ezrahite.

7. **Anonymous authors**: Many Psalms remain anonymous and may have been penned by various authors over different periods in Israel's history.

Overall, the Psalms reflect a wide range of human emotion, worship, and the community's experiences with God, showcasing contributions from multiple generations and perspectives.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of key figures involved in writing the Psalms, which aligns well with the reference answer. However, the student included additional details about the Sons of Korah, Heman, Ethan, and anonymous authors, which while informative, slightly detracts from the focus on the main key figures. Overall, a strong answer demonstrating a good understanding of the authorship of Psalms, earning a solid grade.
