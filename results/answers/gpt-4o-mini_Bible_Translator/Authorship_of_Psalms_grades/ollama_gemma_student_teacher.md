2. **Asaph**: Asaph was a Levite and one of the leaders of David's choir. Several Psalms (specifically Psalms 73–83) are attributed to him and his descendants.

3. **Sons of Korah**: This group, descended from Korah, is credited with writing several Psalms (such as Psalms 42, 44–49, 84, 85, and 87).

4. **Solomon**: Some Psalms are attributed to King Solomon, particularly Psalm 72 and Psalm 127, reflecting his wisdom and reign.

5. **Moses**: Psalm 90 is attributed to Moses, marking it as one of the oldest Psalms in the collection.

6. **Heman and Ethan**: These figures are associated with a few Psalms as well. Psalm 88 is attributed to Heman the Ezrahite, and Psalm 89 is attributed to Ethan the Ezrahite.

7. **Anonymous authors**: Many Psalms remain anonymous and may have been penned by various authors over different periods in Israel's history.

Overall, the Psalms reflect a wide range of human emotion, worship, and the community's experiences with God, showcasing contributions from multiple generations and perspectives.
