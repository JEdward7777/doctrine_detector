  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the theological significance of the term \"Son of God\" within Christianity and the importance of maintaining its essence in translations. The suggestion of contextualizing the term through explanations or alternative phrasing demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures while upholding the term's theological richness. However, emphasizing the unique and divine nature of Jesus as the Son of God could further strengthen the response, aligning it more closely with Christian doctrinal accuracy."
