  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological significance of the term \"Son of God\" and its potential pitfalls in polytheistic cultures. It also acknowledges the importance of balancing theological fidelity with cultural understanding. The suggested approaches to contextualizing the term, such as using explanatory notes or phrases like \"divine Son,\" show a nuanced appreciation for the challenges translators face.\n\nThe only area where this response could be improved is in its lack of explicit acknowledgment that avoidance can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. However, it does implicitly acknowledge this concern by emphasizing the importance of carefully teaching the meaning of the term through context and explanation.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a strong grasp of the theological and cultural issues at play and provides thoughtful suggestions for navigating these challenges."
