  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and well-rounded perspective on the importance of not avoiding the term \"Son of God\" in translations for polytheistic cultures. It correctly emphasizes the significance of carefully teaching and explaining the term to prevent theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. The suggested approach of contextualizing the term through explanations or footnotes shows a good balance between theological fidelity and cultural sensitivity."
