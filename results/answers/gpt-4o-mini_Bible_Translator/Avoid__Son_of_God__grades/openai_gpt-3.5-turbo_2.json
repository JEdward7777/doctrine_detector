By suggesting a nuanced approach that involves contextualizing and explaining the term rather than avoiding it completely, the answer effectively addresses the concern of potential theological gaps and misunderstandings. The only minor improvement could be further emphasizing the essential nature of conveying the full theological significance of the term in order to prevent misunderstandings about Jesus' unique identity."
