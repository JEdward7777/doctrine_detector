  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded and detailed explanation of the significance of baptism in the life of a Christian according to New Testament teachings. The answer effectively highlighted key aspects such as identification with Christ, public declaration of faith, cleansing of sin, incorporation into the Church, obedience to Christ's command, and symbol of new life. The response was supported by relevant scriptural references and aligned with Christian doctrine on baptism. Great job overall."
