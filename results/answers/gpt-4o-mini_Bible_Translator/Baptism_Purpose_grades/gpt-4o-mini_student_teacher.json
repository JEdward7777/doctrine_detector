  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the significance of baptism according to New Testament teachings. They have effectively highlighted various aspects such as identification with Christ, public declaration of faith, cleansing of sin, incorporation into the Church, obedience to Christ's command, and symbol of new life. However, the student's answer goes beyond the reference answer in terms of depth and elaboration, which is commendable but may have slightly diverged from the focus on cleansing from sin and unity with Christ as the primary significance of baptism in a Christian worldview."
