## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, repentance and baptism are closely linked as essential components of the Christian faith and the process of salvation.

1. **The Call to Repentance**: Throughout the New Testament, both John the Baptist and Jesus emphasize the importance of repentance. For example, in Matthew 3:2, John the Baptist proclaims, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus echoes this call in Mark 1:15, saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."

2. **Baptism as an Outward Expression**: Baptism is presented as an outward demonstration of an inward change that occurs during repentance. In Acts 2:38, Peter tells the crowd to “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.” Here, repentance precedes baptism, indicating that it is a prerequisite for the act of being baptized.

3. **Baptism as a Symbolic Act**: The act of baptism symbolizes the believer's identification with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection. Romans 6:3-4 states, "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life." This indicates that baptism represents a new beginning that follows the repentance.

4. **Repentance and Forgiveness**: The New Testament teaches that repentance is necessary for forgiveness of sins. In Luke 24:47, Jesus, after His resurrection, instructs His disciples to proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in His name to all nations. Baptism, therefore, serves as a public declaration of that repentance and reception of forgiveness.

5. **The Role of Faith**: In many passages, such as Acts 16:31, there is also a strong connection between faith, repentance, and baptism. A person’s belief in Jesus often accompanies repentance and culminates in baptism as a sign of their faith and commitment.

In summary, repentance is viewed as a necessary step toward salvation, and baptism follows as a public acknowledgment of that repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. They are interrelated aspects of the process of becoming a disciple and living a life transformed by faith in Him.
