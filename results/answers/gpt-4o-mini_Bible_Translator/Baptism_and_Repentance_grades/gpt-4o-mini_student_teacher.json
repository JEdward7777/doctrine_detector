  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between repentance and baptism in the New Testament, citing relevant passages and explaining the significance of each component. However, the student could improve the grade by acknowledging that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism, as stated in the reference answer from the teacher. It is important to emphasize this key point in Christian doctrine."
