## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Pharisees were a significant Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, and they held specific beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings that differentiated them from other groups, such as the Sadducees.

1. **Life After Death**: The Pharisees believed in the resurrection of the dead. They affirmed that after death, individuals would be resurrected to stand before God for judgment. This idea is rooted in various texts found in the Hebrew Scriptures, and it became a foundational belief in later Jewish and Christian thought about the afterlife.

2. **Spiritual Beings**: The Pharisees acknowledged the existence of various spiritual beings, including angels, who serve God and interact with humanity. They believed in the reality of the spiritual realm, which included both benevolent beings (like angels) and malevolent forces.

3. **Messianic Expectations**: The Pharisees also held messianic beliefs, expecting a future Messiah who would restore Israel and establish God's kingdom on Earth. This expectation was often tied to their eschatological views about the end times and the resurrection of the righteous.

These beliefs found some support in texts such as Daniel 12:2, which speaks of the resurrection of the dead, and in the New Testament, where Jesus often engages with Pharisaic beliefs, particularly regarding the resurrection (as seen in passages like Mark 12:18-27).

Overall, the Pharisees contributed significantly to the religious and doctrinal landscape of Judaism, and their beliefs influenced early Christian theology, particularly concerning resurrection and eternal life.
