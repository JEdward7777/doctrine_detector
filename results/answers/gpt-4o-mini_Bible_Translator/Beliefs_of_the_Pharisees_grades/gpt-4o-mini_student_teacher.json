  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings, drawing from relevant texts and connecting their beliefs to broader religious and doctrinal contexts. They also made a connection to early Christian theology, demonstrating a strong understanding of the historical and theological significance of Pharisaic beliefs. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on concise and direct responses to the specific beliefs of the Pharisees, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
