  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive discussion of the Pharisees' beliefs regarding life after death, spiritual beings, and messianic expectations, showing a deep understanding of the Pharisaic worldview during Jesus' time. The inclusion of relevant biblical references and the acknowledgment of the Pharisees' influence on early Christian theology further enrich the analysis. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include more explicit connections to Jesus' teachings or interactions with the Pharisees to strengthen the discussion further."
