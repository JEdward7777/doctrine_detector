Sharing "in Christ" refers to the concept of believers being united with Jesus Christ and with one another through faith. This union offers numerous benefits according to Christian theology:

1. **Spiritual Identity**: Believers receive a new identity as children of God through their union with Christ (John 1:12, 2 Corinthians 5:17). This transformation allows them to see themselves and others through the lens of Christ's love and grace.

2. **Forgiveness of Sins**: In Christ, believers are assured of forgiveness and redemption (Ephesians 1:7, 1 John 1:9). This freedom from guilt empowers them to live in grace rather than shame.

3. **Access to God**: The relationship between believers and God is restored through Christ (Hebrews 10:19-22). Christians can approach God confidently in prayer, knowing they are heard as His children.

4. **Spiritual Growth**: Sharing in Christ fosters spiritual growth and maturity (Colossians 2:6-7). Believers are encouraged to deepen their faith and cultivate the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).

5. **Community**: Being "in Christ" connects believers with one another as part of the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-27). This community provides support, encouragement, and accountability.

6. **Hope and Assurance**: The promise of eternal life and the hope of resurrection are foundational benefits of being in Christ (John 3:16, Romans 8:38-39). Believers have confidence in their future and purpose beyond this life.

7. **Empowerment for Service**: Believers are called to serve others, empowered by the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 2:10). Their union with Christ equips them with spiritual gifts and the motivation to love and serve.

8. **Peace and Joy**: In Christ, believers can experience true peace and joy, regardless of external circumstances (Philippians 4:7, John 15:11). This inner stability comes from the assurance of His presence and provision.

9. **Transformation and Renewal**: Sharing in Christ leads to ongoing transformation as believers align their thoughts and actions with His teachings (Romans 12:1-2). This transformation affects personal character and relationships.

10. **Mission and Purpose**: Believers are called to be ambassadors for Christ, sharing the good news and making disciples (Matthew 28:19-20). Their identity in Christ gives them a clear mission and purpose in life.

Overall, sharing in Christ enriches the believer's life and empowers their witness, shaping how they view themselves and engage with the world.
