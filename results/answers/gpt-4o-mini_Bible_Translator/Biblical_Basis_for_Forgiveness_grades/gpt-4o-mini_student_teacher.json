They have accurately included relevant verses that support the practice of forgiveness among believers. However, the reference answer from the teacher has mentioned a more condensed list of key verses, which could have been more focused. Overall, the student's answer is thorough and demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of forgiveness in a Christian worldview."
