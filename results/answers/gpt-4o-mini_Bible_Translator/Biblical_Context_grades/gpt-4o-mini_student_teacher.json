  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, particularly in Acts 6:1-7 and 1 Timothy 3:8-13. They have correctly highlighted the practical aspect of the deacons' role in serving the church community. However, the student's answer could be improved by explicitly addressing the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, as specified in the reference answer. They should have emphasized the importance of fairness and equity in the distribution of resources, especially to marginalized groups like widows, as a key aspect of the deacons' responsibilities."
