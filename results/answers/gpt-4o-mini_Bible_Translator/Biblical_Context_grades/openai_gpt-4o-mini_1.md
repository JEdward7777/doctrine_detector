## [Answer](../Biblical_Context.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the responsibilities of deacons are primarily outlined in the Book of Acts and in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy and Philippians).

1. **Acts 6:1-7**: This passage describes the original appointment of deacons in the early church. The apostles needed assistance in ministry, particularly in distributing food to widows, to ensure that their focus could remain on prayer and the ministry of the Word. This indicates that deacons are called to serve the practical needs of the church so that spiritual leaders can concentrate on teaching and spiritual oversight.

2. **1 Timothy 3:8-13**: In this passage, the Apostle Paul provides specific qualifications for deacons. He mentions that they must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, and not greedy for dishonest gain. They should hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience, and they are to be tested before serving. Additionally, the passage states that those who serve well as deacons will gain a good standing and great confidence in the faith.

3. **Philippians 1:1**: This verse mentions "deacons" alongside "overseers" as part of the church leadership structure, implying that deacons have an important role in the governance and ministry of the church.

Overall, the New Testament portrays deacons as individuals called to serve the needs of the church community, assisting in practical matters, and ensuring that spiritual leaders can focus on their primary responsibilities. Their role is rooted in service, and they are expected to embody qualities of integrity, wisdom, and faithfulness.
