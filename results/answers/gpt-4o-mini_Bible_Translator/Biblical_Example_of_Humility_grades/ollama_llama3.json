  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and specific example of humility in the Bible, namely Moses, and explores his character and actions in detail. The use of Scripture (Numbers 12:3 and Exodus 32) is also excellent, as it provides concrete evidence for Moses's humility. Additionally, the writer ties this example back to the concern about the importance of humility in leadership and faithfulness to God's calling.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are:\n\n1. While David is an example of a righteous man, he wasn't necessarily known for his humility (at least not in the same way that Moses was). Therefore, it would have been helpful to elaborate on how David's life and actions illustrate humility.\n2. The conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could be strengthened by summarizing the main points made earlier in the response.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern about finding tangible examples of humility in Scripture."
