By providing specific examples from the Book of Numbers and Exodus, the answer effectively addresses the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. The connection between Moses's humility, leadership, and faithfulness to God is well-illustrated, aligning with a Christian worldview. The response could have been strengthened by directly addressing David's example of humility in relation to the concern, but overall, it effectively highlights Moses's humility in a biblical context."
