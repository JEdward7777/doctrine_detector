## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
One of the most prominent biblical characters who exemplified humility is Moses. Throughout the narrative in the Book of Numbers, Moses is described as "very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth" (Numbers 12:3, ESV). Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and to receive the Law, Moses often showed a deep sense of humility in his relationship with God and his leadership.

One striking example of his humility is found in Exodus 32, when the Israelites worshipped the golden calf. Upon learning of their sin, Moses interceded for them, pleading with God to forgive them rather than seeking his own glory or benefit. He even offered to have his own name blotted out of God's book for the sake of the people (Exodus 32:32). This selflessness and desire to put others before himself reflect the humility that marked Moses's character.

Overall, Moses’s life illustrates the importance of humility in the context of leadership and faithfulness to God’s calling.
