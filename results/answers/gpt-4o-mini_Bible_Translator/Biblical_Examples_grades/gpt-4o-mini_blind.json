  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized response that accurately identified key biblical figures cited as examples of being blameless and highlighted valuable lessons from their lives. The integration of relevant Bible verses and theological interpretations was solid. The response effectively emphasized the importance of faithfulness, integrity, resilience in trials, and trust in God\u2019s sovereignty as key themes derived from these biblical examples. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further deepen the theological reflection or practical application of these lessons for believers today. Overall, a commendable and doctrinally sound response."
