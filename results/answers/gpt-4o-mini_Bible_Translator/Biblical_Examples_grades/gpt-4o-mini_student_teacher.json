  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that effectively explores the lives of various biblical figures cited as examples of blamelessness. They have successfully drawn lessons on faith, integrity, obedience to God, and resilience in trials from each example. While the response is detailed and well-structured, it does not directly address the specified concern of practical application for Christians in their own lives. Encouraging more explicit connections to how Christians today can apply these lessons would have strengthened the response further."
