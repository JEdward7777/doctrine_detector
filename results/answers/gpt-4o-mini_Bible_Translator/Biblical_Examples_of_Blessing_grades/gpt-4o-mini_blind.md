## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One of the most notable examples of God blessing creation can be found in the Book of Genesis. After God created the earth and all living things, He pronounced blessings on them. In Genesis 1:22, it is written:

*"And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.'"* (Genesis 1:22, ESV)

This verse follows the creation of sea creatures and birds, showcasing God's intent for creation to thrive and flourish. Additionally, in Genesis 1:28, after creating humanity, God again blesses them, saying:

*"And God blessed them. And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'"* (Genesis 1:28, ESV)

These passages illustrate God's desire for His creation to flourish and for humanity to steward it responsibly.
