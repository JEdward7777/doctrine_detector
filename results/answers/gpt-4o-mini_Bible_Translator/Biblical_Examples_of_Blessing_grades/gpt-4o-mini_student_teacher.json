  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough answer by referencing both Genesis 1:22 and 1:28, demonstrating an understanding of how God blessed His creation in different contexts. However, the student included additional information beyond the reference answer, which is not necessary and could have been more concise. Overall, a solid response from a Christian worldview perspective."
