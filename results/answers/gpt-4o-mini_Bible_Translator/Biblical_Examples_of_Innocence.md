## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! The concept of innocence, especially regarding Jesus and his accusers, is a significant theme in Scripture. Here are some key examples:

1. **Jesus’ Sinlessness**:
   - **Hebrews 4:15**: "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin." This verse highlights the innocence and sinlessness of Jesus, affirming His role as the perfect sacrifice.

2. **The Witness of Pilate**:
   - **John 18:38**: When questioning Jesus, Pontius Pilate asks, "What is truth?" After his examination of Jesus, Pilate declares in John 19:4, "I find no guilt in him." Pilate's proclamation demonstrates that even an earthly judge recognized Jesus’ innocence.

3. **The Testimony of the Thief on the Cross**:
   - **Luke 23:41**: One of the criminals crucified beside Jesus acknowledges his own guilt and contrasts it with Jesus, saying, "And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiss." This thief’s confession points to Jesus’ innocence even in His final moments.

4. **The Accusations Against Jesus**:
   - **Matthew 26:59-60**: Here, the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but they found none. This illustrates that the accusations against Him were unfounded and aimed at silencing an innocent man.

5. **Jesus' Own Claims of Innocence**:
   - **John 8:46**: Jesus challenges His accusers by asking, "Which one of you convicts me of sin?" This rhetorical question emphasizes His innocence, implying that no one could truly accuse Him of wrongdoing.

6. **The Apostle Peter’s Testimony**:
   - **Acts 3:14**: In his sermon, Peter says, "But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you." Referring to Jesus as the "Holy and Righteous One" affirms His innocence and highlights the unjust choice made by the people.

7. **The Religious Leaders’ Hypocrisy**:
   - **Matthew 23:28**: Jesus refers to the scribes and Pharisees, saying, "So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness." This contrast illustrates the innocence of Jesus compared to the guilt of His accusers, who were outwardly religious yet inwardly corrupt.

These examples collectively portray Jesus as the innocent one amid a backdrop of false accusations and injustice, underscoring His unique position and the wrongful nature of His condemnation.
