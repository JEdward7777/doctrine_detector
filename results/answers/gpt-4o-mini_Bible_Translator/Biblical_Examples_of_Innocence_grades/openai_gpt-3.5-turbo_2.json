The examples cited are relevant and well-supported by Scripture, providing a comprehensive overview of the theme of innocence surrounding Jesus. The integration of multiple biblical references and explanations adds depth and clarity to the discussion. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern raised within a Christian worldview. Well done!"
