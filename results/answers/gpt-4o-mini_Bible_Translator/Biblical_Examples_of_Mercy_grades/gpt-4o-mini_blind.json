  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of key examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy. The student effectively references various biblical passages and stories to support their points. The inclusion of diverse examples, from both the Old and New Testaments, enriches the discussion on mercy as a central theme in Scripture. The connections made between each example and the broader concept of God's mercy and human response are well articulated. Overall, a strong and well-supported response."
