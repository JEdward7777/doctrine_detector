  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-detailed response with a variety of examples from the Bible that demonstrate the power and importance of prayer. They effectively connected each biblical story to the significance of prayer in fostering a stronger prayer life. However, the student could have included additional references such as Isaac praying for Rebekah's fertility (Genesis 25:21), Moses praying for the people (Numbers 14:19), and Jesus instructing His disciples to pray to avoid temptation (Matthew 26:41) to further enrich their answer."
