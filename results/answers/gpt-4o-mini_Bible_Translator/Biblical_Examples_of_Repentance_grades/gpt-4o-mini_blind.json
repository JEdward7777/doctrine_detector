The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of repentance as turning away from sin and returning to God in a genuine manner, supported by appropriate scriptural references. The answer aligns well with a Christian worldview and emphasizes the importance of repentance as a transformative process rather than just a surface-level emotion. Great job!"
