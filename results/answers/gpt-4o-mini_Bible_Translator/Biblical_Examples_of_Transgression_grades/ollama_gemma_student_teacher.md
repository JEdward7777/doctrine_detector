## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Transgression.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Transgression in the Bible often refers to the act of violating God's commandments or laws. Here are several key references that illustrate this concept:

1. **Exodus 20:1-17** - The Ten Commandments outline fundamental moral laws, and any violation of these commands can be seen as a transgression against God’s will.

2. **Psalm 51:1-2** - In King David's penitential psalm, he pleads for mercy and asks God to wash away his transgressions, acknowledging his wrongdoing.

3. **Isaiah 53:5** - This verse speaks of the suffering servant bearing our transgressions, highlighting the gravity of sin and the need for redemption.

4. **Romans 5:15-19** - The Apostle Paul discusses the concept of sin entering the world through one man's transgression (Adam) and how that affects humanity.

5. **1 John 3:4** - “Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.” This passage directly connects sin with transgression of God's law.

6. **James 2:9** - James states that if someone shows favoritism, they commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors, reinforcing the idea that violating any part of the law constitutes transgression.

7. **Galatians 3:19** - Paul speaks of the law being given because of transgressions until the Seed (Christ) should come, indicating that the law serves to expose and address human transgressions.

These references collectively provide a theological understanding of transgression in the context of sin, law, and redemption in the Christian narrative.
