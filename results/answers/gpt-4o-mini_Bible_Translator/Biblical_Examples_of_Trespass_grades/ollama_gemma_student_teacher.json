  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that effectively addresses the question from a Christian perspective. The student provides several relevant biblical examples and clearly explains the associated moral and spiritual lessons. The inclusion of passages from Leviticus, Matthew, Luke, Galatians, Ephesians, and 1 John demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of trespass in the Bible. The connection between sin, forgiveness, community, holiness, accountability, and the need for divine grace is well articulated. The response also acknowledges the need for mercy and grace in addressing wrongdoing."
