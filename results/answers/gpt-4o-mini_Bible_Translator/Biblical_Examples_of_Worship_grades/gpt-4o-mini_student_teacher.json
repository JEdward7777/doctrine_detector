  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer, referencing the relevant passage in Exodus 20:3-5 and elaborating on the contrast between worshiping God and idol worship. The student effectively highlighted the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God in worship, in line with the concern provided. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly quote the specific command from Exodus 20:3 as done in the reference answer for a more direct comparison. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
