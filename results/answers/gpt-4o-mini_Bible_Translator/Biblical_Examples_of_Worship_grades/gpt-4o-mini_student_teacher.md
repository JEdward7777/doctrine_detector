## Question [Biblical Examples of Worship](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md)
Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

## Correct Answer
One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One significant example of worship being negatively contrasted with idol worship can be found in the book of Exodus, particularly in Exodus 20:3-5. In this passage, God gives the Ten Commandments to the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of exclusive worship to Him and prohibiting the worship of other gods or idols.

Exodus 20:3-5 (ESV) states:

3 "You shall have no other gods before me.  
4 You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.  
5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God..."

In these verses, the command to worship God alone is directly contrasted with the act of making and worshiping idols. This sets a clear boundary between true worship of the one true God and the false worship of idols, demonstrating God's desire for a relationship with His people based on faithfulness and singular devotion.
