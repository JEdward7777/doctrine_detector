## Question [Biblical Examples of Worship](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md)
Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

## Correct Answer
One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One significant example of worship being negatively contrasted with idol worship can be found in the book of Exodus, particularly in Exodus 20:3-5. In this passage, God gives the Ten Commandments to the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of exclusive worship to Him and prohibiting the worship of other gods or idols.

Exodus 20:3-5 (ESV) states:

3 "You shall have no other gods before me.  
4 You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.  
5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God..."

In these verses, the command to worship God alone is directly contrasted with the act of making and worshiping idols. This sets a clear boundary between true worship of the one true God and the false worship of idols, demonstrating God's desire for a relationship with His people based on faithfulness and singular devotion.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The main strength of this response is that it accurately identifies the passage in Exodus 20:3 as an example of worship being negatively contrasted with idol worship, which aligns well with the concern of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands. The response also provides a clear and concise summary of the passage, highlighting God's command to worship Him alone.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. Firstly, while it mentions that this passage is an example of worship being negatively contrasted with idol worship, it could provide more detail and analysis on how this contrasts with idol worship. Additionally, the response could have explored the implications of this command for our own lives and faith practices.

Overall, while this response provides a good foundation, it could benefit from further development and exploration to fully address the concern and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the biblical text.
