## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Jesus gave several important directives to his apostles regarding the good news, often referred to as the Gospel. One of the most notable directives can be found in the Great Commission, which is recorded in Matthew 28:18-20. In this passage, Jesus instructs his apostles to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he has commanded. 

Additionally, in Mark 16:15, Jesus tells his apostles to "go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation." This emphasizes the command to spread the message of salvation and the Kingdom of God to all people. 

Furthermore, in Acts 1:8, Jesus promises that the Holy Spirit will empower them to be his witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. This directive underlines their mission to share the good news globally, demonstrating the inclusive nature of the Gospel.

I would give this response a score of 85.

The student does a good job of recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith, citing specific passages from the Bible that emphasize Jesus' commission to his apostles to spread the Gospel globally. The response also touches on the key message of the Gospel, namely trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin.

However, the student's answer could be more comprehensive. For example, they do not explicitly mention the Holy Spirit's role in empowering believers to share the Good News, which is an important aspect of evangelism. Additionally, while the student references Jesus' command to "make disciples," they do not delve deeper into what this means practically or how it applies to everyday life.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical foundation for evangelism, but could benefit from more depth and application.
