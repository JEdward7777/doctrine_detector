The incorporation of biblical passages such as Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:15, and Acts 1:8 further solidifies the understanding of the significance of evangelism in the Christian worldview. The response effectively communicates the central role of sharing the good news about salvation and the Kingdom of God to all people, aligning well with Christian beliefs and practices."
