The scriptures mentioned support the idea of spreading the good news globally and making disciples of all nations, highlighting the significance of evangelism in sharing the message of salvation and the Kingdom of God. The response could have been strengthened by incorporating more explicit connections between the directives given by Jesus and the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith."
