## [Answer](../Biblical_Fulfillment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "King of the Jews" ascribed to Jesus in the New Testament indeed reflects numerous Old Testament prophecies regarding the messianic figure who would come to rule Israel. This title is most prominently used in the context of Jesus' crucifixion, where it is inscribed on the charge above His head (Matthew 27:37, Mark 15:26, Luke 23:38, John 19:19). 

Several key Old Testament references and themes help to frame this title:

1. **Davidic Covenant**: The promise made to King David in 2 Samuel 7:12-16, where God establishes that David’s lineage will endure forever, sets the foundational expectation for a coming king. This covenant underlines the belief that the Messiah would be a descendant of David, fulfilling the role of king.

2. **Isaiah’s Prophecies**: In Isaiah 9:6-7, a child is foretold who will be called "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." This child’s kingdom is described as everlasting, which aligns with the idea of a messianic king who will rule justly and peacefully.

3. **Zechariah 9:9**: The prophecy in Zechariah speaks of a king coming to Jerusalem, humble and riding on a donkey. This event is notably fulfilled during Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:5), suggesting His rightful status as king.

4. **Messianic Expectations**: The Old Testament is rife with messianic expectations. Texts such as Jeremiah 23:5 and Micah 5:2 highlight that a ruler will emerge from Bethlehem, further pointing to the birth and lineage of Jesus.

5. **Royal Titles**: The use of “King” reflects Jewish thought on authority and governance. Through His ministry, Jesus’ identity as king is more than political; it encompasses spiritual reign, evident in His proclamations about the Kingdom of God (as seen throughout the Gospels, particularly in Matthew).

Overall, the references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" not only fulfill specific Old Testament prophecies but also encapsulate His role as the ultimate Messiah who transcends conventional kingship by establishing a profound spiritual kingdom. This concept is crucial for understanding the nature of Jesus' mission and the nature of His kingship in Christian theology.
