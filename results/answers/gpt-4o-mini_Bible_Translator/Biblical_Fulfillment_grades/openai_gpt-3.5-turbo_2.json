The integration of key Old Testament references and themes, such as the Davidic Covenant, Isaiah's prophecies, Zechariah 9:9, messianic expectations, and the concept of a spiritual kingdom, effectively demonstrates the significance of this title in Christian theology. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment in understanding the nature of Jesus' mission and kingship within a Christian worldview."
