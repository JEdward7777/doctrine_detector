  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses that beautifully illustrate the concept of God's majesty, connecting each verse to different aspects of God's greatness and power. While the reference answer from the teacher included additional verses, the student's selection effectively highlights the majestic nature of God in His reign, glory, and creation. Great job connecting scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature."
