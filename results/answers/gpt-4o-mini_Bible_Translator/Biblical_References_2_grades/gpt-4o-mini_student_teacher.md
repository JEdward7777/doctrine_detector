2. **Psalm 8:1**: "O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens."

3. **Psalm 104:1**: "Praise the LORD, my soul. LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty."

4. **Isaiah 6:1**: "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple."

5. **1 Chronicles 29:11**: "Yours, LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, LORD, is the kingdom; you are exalted as head over all."

6. **Revelation 4:11**: "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."
