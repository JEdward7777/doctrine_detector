The verses quoted beautifully highlight God's reign, glory, power, and splendor, showcasing His greatness over all creation. However, it would have been beneficial to further connect these verses with the understanding of God's majestic nature, explaining how each passage reveals different facets of His majesty. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological reflection."
