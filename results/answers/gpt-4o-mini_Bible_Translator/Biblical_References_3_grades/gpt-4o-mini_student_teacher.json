  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the Old Testament references contributing to the understanding of the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah. They have provided detailed explanations and effectively connected these passages to the messianic role of Jesus. Additionally, they have shown a good grasp of the significance of each reference within a Christian worldview. However, the student could have further emphasized the direct connection between the Old Testament and New Testament understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man,' as outlined in the teacher's reference answer."
