  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of the \"Son of Man\" in the Old Testament and its relevance to the messianic expectations. The inclusion of specific passages and their connection to the title reinforces the argument. The response also acknowledges the broader context of humanity and the Messiah's role as a true representative. However, the grading could be improved by providing more detailed analysis of the specific passages mentioned and their relevance to the understanding of the \"Son of Man\" title."
