  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does attempt to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\", which aligns with the concern. However, it falls short in several areas:\n\n1. The answer provided is limited and only mentions two specific references (Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel), whereas the original response provides a more comprehensive overview by referencing multiple Old Testament passages that contribute to the understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\".\n2. The concern asks to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding, but the provided answer does not provide sufficient analysis or connection between the two Testaments.\n3. While the response mentions Ezekiel, it does not adequately discuss the significance of this passage in relation to Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\".\n\nOn the other hand, the original response provides a more thorough and biblical discussion on the topic, highlighting key Old Testament passages that contribute to the understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\". It also connects these passages to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of this title.\n\nOverall, while the provided answer has some merit, it does not demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic and fails to provide sufficient biblical analysis. Therefore, I would give it a grade of 85, acknowledging its attempt to address the concern but lacking in depth and comprehensiveness."
