## Question [Biblical References 3](../../../questions/Biblical_References_3.md)
Which Old Testament references contribute to the understanding of the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah?

## Correct Answer
Key references include Daniel 7:14, where the 'Son of Man' is depicted coming with the clouds, and Ezekiel, where God addresses Ezekiel as 'son of man,' illustrating the connection between the title and prophetic identity.

## Stated Concern
To explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus’ messianic role as the 'Son of Man.'

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "Son of Man" as it applies to the coming Messiah is rooted in several Old Testament passages that contribute to its understanding in a messianic context. Here are some key references:

1. **Daniel 7:13-14**: This is perhaps the most significant passage associated with the title "Son of Man." In this vision, Daniel sees "one like a son of man" coming with the clouds of heaven and approaching the Ancient of Days. This figure is given authority, glory, and an everlasting kingdom, which has messianic implications of a coming ruler.

2. **Psalm 8:4-6**: This psalm reflects on the nature of humanity and acknowledges the role of "man" (or "son of man") in relation to creation. Though it speaks generally about humanity, it serves as a foundation for understanding the significant role that the Messiah, as a true representative of humanity, will have in God's kingdom.

3. **Ezekiel**: Though Ezekiel often refers to himself as "son of man" (e.g., Ezekiel 2:1), the title emphasizes humanity and may foreshadow the role of the Messiah as fully human (and yet fully divine). It symbolizes the faithful servant of God, which the Messiah will embody.

4. **Isaiah 53**: While this passage does not use the specific term "Son of Man," it describes the suffering servant who bears the sins of many, reflecting the kind of Messiah that the Jewish people were to expect. This servant role can be seen as connected to the concept of the Son of Man who suffers and redeems.

5. **Genesis 3:15**: The protoevangelium, or the first announcement of the Gospel, hints at a coming figure who will crush the serpent's head. The term “seed of the woman” is sometimes linked to the understanding of the Messiah’s humanity, which connects to the idea of the "Son of Man."

These texts together contribute to the rich tapestry of messianic expectations in the Old Testament, framing the eventual revelation of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of the "Son of Man" title in the New Testament, particularly in the gospels where Jesus frequently uses this title for himself.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response does attempt to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man", which aligns with the concern. However, it falls short in several areas:

1. The answer provided is limited and only mentions two specific references (Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel), whereas the original response provides a more comprehensive overview by referencing multiple Old Testament passages that contribute to the understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man".
2. The concern asks to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding, but the provided answer does not provide sufficient analysis or connection between the two Testaments.
3. While the response mentions Ezekiel, it does not adequately discuss the significance of this passage in relation to Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man".

On the other hand, the original response provides a more thorough and biblical discussion on the topic, highlighting key Old Testament passages that contribute to the understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man". It also connects these passages to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of this title.

Overall, while the provided answer has some merit, it does not demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic and fails to provide sufficient biblical analysis. Therefore, I would give it a grade of 85, acknowledging its attempt to address the concern but lacking in depth and comprehensiveness.
