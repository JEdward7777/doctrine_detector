The references to Daniel, Ezekiel, Psalms, Isaiah, and Genesis, along with their messianic implications, demonstrate a strong grasp of how the Old Testament foreshadows Jesus as the fulfillment of the Son of Man in the New Testament. The response could have further expanded on the direct link between these Old Testament passages and how they directly influence the portrayal of Jesus as the Son of Man in the New Testament, hence the slight deduction from a perfect score."
