It effectively integrates key Old Testament passages and concepts, demonstrating a clear connection between the prophetic identity of the 'Son of Man' in the Old Testament and its fulfillment in Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The inclusion of additional Old Testament references enriches the analysis and enhances the overall depth of understanding."
