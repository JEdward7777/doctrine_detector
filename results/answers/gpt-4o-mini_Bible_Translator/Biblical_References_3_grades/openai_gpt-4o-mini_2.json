  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of key Old Testament passages contributing to the understanding of the title \"Son of Man\" in a messianic context. The references provided are relevant and demonstrate a connection between the prophetic identity of the 'Son of Man' in the Old Testament and its fulfillment in Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The biblical insights are well-presented and align with a Christian worldview, although further elaboration on the direct correlation between the Old Testament anticipation and the New Testament realization of Jesus as the 'Son of Man' could enhance the response."
