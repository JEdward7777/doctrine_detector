  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the term \"Lord\" in the context of God, supported by relevant biblical passages. The student effectively highlights the significance of the title \"Lord\" in conveying God's authority and sovereignty. However, to improve the grade, the response could have delved deeper into the doctrinal implications of Jesus being referred to as \"Lord\" and the theological significance behind it, especially in connection with the Trinity and Christ's role as the Son of God. Expanding on these theological themes would enhance the overall doctrinal richness of the answer."
