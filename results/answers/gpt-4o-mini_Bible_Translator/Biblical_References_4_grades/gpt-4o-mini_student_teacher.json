  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured answer with relevant biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God, highlighting His authority and sovereignty. The selected passages effectively reinforce the idea of acknowledging God as Lord. However, the student could have included more concise examples and referenced all the passages mentioned in the teacher's specific answer for a more comprehensive response. Overall, a strong understanding of the importance of recognizing God's lordship is demonstrated in the answer."
