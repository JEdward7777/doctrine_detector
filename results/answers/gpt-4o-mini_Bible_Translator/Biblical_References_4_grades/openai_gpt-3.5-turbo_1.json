  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Lord\" in the Bible, supported by relevant biblical passages that highlight God's authority and sovereignty. It effectively reinforces the importance of acknowledging God as Lord through biblical references, aligning well with the concern provided. The only room for improvement would be to further elaborate on the significance of each passage in relation to God's authority, but overall, this is a strong and knowledgeable response."
