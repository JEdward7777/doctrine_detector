## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of unleavened bread is closely connected to the New Testament through several passages that reference the Last Supper and the significance of the Eucharist (Communion) in Christian teachings. One key scripture is found in **1 Corinthians 11:23-26**, where the Apostle Paul recounts the Last Supper, emphasizing the bread as representing the body of Christ. Here, the bread's unleavened nature can be associated with purity and Jesusâ€™ sinlessness.

Additionally, **Matthew 26:17-29**, **Mark 14:12-25**, and **Luke 22:7-20** all describe the same event, where Jesus shares unleavened bread with His disciples during Passover and establishes the practice of Communion as a remembrance of His sacrificial death.

Moreover, in **1 Corinthians 5:6-8**, Paul explicitly discusses the symbolism of leaven and unleavened bread, urging believers to "cleanse out the old leaven" so that they may be a "new lump," referencing the seriousness of sin and the need for a pure life in Christ, aligning with the removal of leavened bread during Passover. 

These passages collectively highlight the theological significance of unleavened bread within the framework of Christian belief, particularly relating to the sacrifice of Jesus and the call to holiness among believers.
