The student accurately references key scriptures such as 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, Matthew 26:17-29, Mark 14:12-25, Luke 22:7-20, and 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 to support their argument. The student effectively explains the symbolism of unleavened bread in relation to purity, sinlessness, sacrificial death, and the call to holiness in Christ. Overall, this is an excellent response with doctrinal correctness and a thorough examination of the topic. Great job!"
