  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively identifies multiple relevant biblical texts, including 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, Matthew 26:17-29, Mark 14:12-25, Luke 22:7-20, and 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, that provide clear insight into the significance of unleavened bread in Christian practices. The analysis connects these passages to the concept of purity, sinlessness, Christ's sacrifice, and the call to holiness, demonstrating a strong understanding of the theological implications of unleavened bread in the Christian faith."
