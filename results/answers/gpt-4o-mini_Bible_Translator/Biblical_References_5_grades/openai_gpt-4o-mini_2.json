  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively identifies and analyzes several relevant biblical passages (1 Corinthians 11:23-26, Matthew 26:17-29, Mark 14:12-25, Luke 22:7-20, 1 Corinthians 5:6-8) that provide insight into the Christian practice of unleavened bread. The connections drawn between these passages and the significance of unleavened bread in relation to purity, sinlessness, the Last Supper, Communion, and holiness are insightful and demonstrate a strong understanding of the Christian worldview. Great job!"
