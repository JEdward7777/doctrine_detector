  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer, citing relevant Bible verses that offer insight into the concept of resurrection. The verses selected are appropriate and demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic. The response aligns well with the concern of focusing on scripture as the basis for Christian beliefs and teachings. However, the student could have included a couple more verses to further enrich the discussion and provide a more comprehensive overview of the concept of resurrection in the Bible."
