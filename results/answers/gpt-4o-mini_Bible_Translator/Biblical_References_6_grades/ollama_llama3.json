  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive list of Bible verses that discuss resurrection and eternal life, including some key passages mentioned in the original answer. The inclusion of multiple references from different books of the Bible (e.g., John, Corinthians, Romans) demonstrates a good understanding of the concept's significance across different biblical genres.\n\nThe response also shows an effort to contextualize the concept of resurrection within the broader Christian narrative, highlighting Christ's resurrection as a central theme and emphasizing its implications for believers. This attention to scriptural authority is commendable and aligns well with the concern about grounding beliefs and teachings in authoritative Christian texts.\n\nThe only deduction comes from the fact that the response does not explicitly engage with the original answer or provide additional insights that build upon the provided verses. However, this is a minor quibble, as the response still effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical concept of resurrection.\n\nOverall, the response receives a high grade for its thoroughness, biblicism, and attention to scriptural authority."
