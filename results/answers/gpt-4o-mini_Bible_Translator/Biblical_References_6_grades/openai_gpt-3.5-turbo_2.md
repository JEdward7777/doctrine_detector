## [Answer](../Biblical_References_6.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of resurrection is a fundamental theme in the Bible, particularly in relation to both the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the hope of resurrection for believers. Here are some key verses that provide insight into this important theological concept:

1. **John 11:25-26**: Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?"

2. **1 Corinthians 15:20-22**: "But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive."

3. **Romans 6:4**: "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

4. **Philippians 3:10-11**: "I want to know Christâ€”yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead."

5. **Revelation 20:12-13**: "And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books."

6. **1 Thessalonians 4:13-14**: "Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him."

7. **Hebrews 11:35**: "Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection."

These verses collectively highlight the promise of resurrection, the significance of Christ's resurrection, and the hope of eternal life for believers.
