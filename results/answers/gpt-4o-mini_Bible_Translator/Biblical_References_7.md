## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! The Sabbath is significant in the Bible and is mentioned in several key passages. Here are a few references that highlight its importance:

1. **Genesis 2:2-3**: "And on the seventh day God finished His work that He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work that He had done. So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all His work that He had done in creation."  
   - This passage establishes the Sabbath as a day of rest, reflecting God's own rest after creation.

2. **Exodus 20:8-11**: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."  
   - Here, the Sabbath is included in the Ten Commandments, emphasizing its sacredness and the importance of resting.

3. **Deuteronomy 5:12-15**: "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work... You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm."  
   - This passage adds a historical element, linking the observance of the Sabbath to the Israelites' deliverance from slavery.

4. **Isaiah 58:13-14**: "If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy day of the Lord honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly; then you shall take delight in the Lord..."  
   - In this verse, the Sabbath is portrayed as a day of joy and honor, one that is meant to be delightful rather than burdensome.

5. **Mark 2:27**: "And He said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.'"  
   - Jesus clarifies the purpose of the Sabbath, indicating that it serves the well-being of humanity rather than being an oppressive rule.

These passages collectively illustrate the Sabbath's role as a day of rest, worship, and reflection, rooted in creation and covenant, and highlight its significance for spiritual and physical renewal.
