  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response that effectively addresses the concern of exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. They cited relevant verses and clearly explained how the concept of ransom contributes to the understanding of redemption in Christian theology. However, the teacher's reference answer included some key verses that were not covered by the student, potentially leading to a slightly lower grade. Great work overall in integrating biblical passages and theological insights!"
