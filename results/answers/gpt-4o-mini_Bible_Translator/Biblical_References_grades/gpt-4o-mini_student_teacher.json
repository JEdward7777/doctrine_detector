  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided several relevant verses that effectively highlight the concept of covenant faithfulness throughout the Bible. However, the reference answer given by the teacher includes specific verses that the student did not mention, which may have provided a more comprehensive explanation. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic but could have enhanced their answer by including the additional verses mentioned by the teacher."
