  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the passages and correctly identified the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith through faith in Jesus rather than adherence to the law. However, the student's answer was a bit verbose and could have been more concise and focused on the specific teachings of grace and inclusion as outlined in the concern. There was also room for improvement in directly connecting the passages to the concept of grace."
