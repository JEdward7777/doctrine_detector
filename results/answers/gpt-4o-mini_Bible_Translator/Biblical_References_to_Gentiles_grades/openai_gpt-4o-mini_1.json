  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively discusses the scriptural passages in Acts and Galatians in relation to the theme of grace and inclusion. It correctly points out the emphasis on faith in Jesus Christ over adherence to the law for justification, particularly for Gentiles. The analysis demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian perspective on the universality of the Gospel message and how it extends to all people. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or elaboration to further support the points made."
