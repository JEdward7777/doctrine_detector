  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer citing relevant Bible verses that provide insight into the concept of heaven. The verses chosen effectively demonstrate different aspects of heaven and its significance in Christian theology. However, the student could further enhance their response by including a broader range of verses, including those suggested in the reference answer from the teacher. This would offer a more diverse perspective on the concept of heaven. Overall, it is a solid answer that shows a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
