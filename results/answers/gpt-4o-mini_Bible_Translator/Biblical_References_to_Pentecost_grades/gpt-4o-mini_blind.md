1. **Exodus**: 
   - **Exodus 23:16**: This verse instructs the Israelites to observe the Festival of Weeks, marking the end of the grain harvest.
   - **Exodus 34:22**: This verse reaffirms the observance of the Festival of Weeks as a time of gathering the first fruits of the harvest.

2. **Leviticus**: 
   - **Leviticus 23:15-22**: This passage provides specific instructions about the Festival of Weeks, including the counting of the omer and the offerings to be made during the festival. It emphasizes the significance of presenting the first fruits of the harvest to the Lord.

3. **Deuteronomy**: 
   - **Deuteronomy 16:9-12**: This section describes the Festival of Weeks and emphasizes the importance of remembering the experience of the Israelites as they came out of Egypt while celebrating the harvest.

4. **Acts of the Apostles**: 
   - **Acts 2:1-4**: This passage describes the events of Pentecost in the New Testament, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles. This event occurred on the day of Pentecost, which is the Greek term for the Jewish Festival of Weeks.

These references highlight the agricultural significance of the festival as well as its spiritual dimensions, particularly in the early Christian context as documented in the New Testament.
