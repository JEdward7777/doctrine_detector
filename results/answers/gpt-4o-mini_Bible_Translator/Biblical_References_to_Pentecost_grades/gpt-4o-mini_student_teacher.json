  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the Festival of Weeks, citing relevant passages from Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Acts. However, the student missed mentioning 2 Chronicles and Numbers, which are also important books containing references to the Festival of Weeks. It is crucial to include all relevant books to provide a comprehensive understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost from a Christian worldview."
