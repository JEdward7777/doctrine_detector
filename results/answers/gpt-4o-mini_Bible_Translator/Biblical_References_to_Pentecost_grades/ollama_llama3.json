  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response only mentions four books (2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts) as having references to the Festival of Weeks, which is incomplete compared to the given answer that provides specific passages from Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy in addition to Acts. While it does touch on the scriptural basis for Pentecost, it lacks a thorough understanding of the significance of the festival and its agricultural and spiritual dimensions."
