  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough overview of the references to the Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot or Pentecost, in key books of the Bible, outlining the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. The response effectively addresses the concern by accurately presenting the specific books and passages where references to the festival can be found. However, there is a minor discrepancy as the original answer mentioned 2 Chronicles and Numbers, which were not included in the detailed response. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost from a Christian worldview."
