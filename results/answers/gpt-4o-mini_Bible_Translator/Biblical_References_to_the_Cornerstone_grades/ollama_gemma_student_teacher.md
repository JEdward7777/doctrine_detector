## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Cornerstone.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of Jesus as the cornerstone is referenced in several key passages in the New Testament, as well as being rooted in the Old Testament. Here are a few significant verses:

1. **Matthew 21:42**: Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" This verse highlights Jesus' role as the foundational stone of God's Kingdom, emphasizing that He was rejected by the religious leaders yet chosen by God for a crucial purpose.

2. **Acts 4:11**: Peter proclaims, "Jesus is 'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.'" This verse reinforces the idea that despite being rejected, Jesus holds a position of ultimate importance in the faith and salvation of believers.

3. **Ephesians 2:19-20**: Paul writes, "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of His household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone." This passage explains how Jesus is the essential foundation of the church, signifying His authority and the unity of believers in Him.

4. **1 Peter 2:6-7**: Peter states, "For in Scripture it says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in Him will never be put to shame.' Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.'" These verses describe Jesus as chosen and precious, emphasizing faith in Him as essential for salvation and honor.

These verses convey that Jesus is central to the Christian faith—He is not only the foundation upon which the church is built but also represents God's intentional plan for redemption and relationship with humanity. The imagery of the cornerstone indicates stability, strength, and essential support for the spiritual structure of the believer’s life and the church as a whole.
