The inclusion of specific verses along with explanations effectively addresses the concern of encouraging believers to explore scripture for a deeper understanding. Additional engagement with the Old Testament reference from Psalms 118:22 could have enhanced the response further. Overall, the response is well-supported, insightful, and aligns with a Christian worldview."
