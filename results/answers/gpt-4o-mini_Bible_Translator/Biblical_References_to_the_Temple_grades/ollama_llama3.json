  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThis response partially addresses the concern by providing some key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\". However, it does not exhaustively cover the Old Testament references to the term and seems to rely on a small number of passages. In contrast, the provided response provides a more comprehensive list of verses that specifically reference the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\", demonstrating a deeper understanding of the concept.\n\nComment: While this response partially addresses the concern, it could be improved by providing a more exhaustive and in-depth analysis of the scriptures related to the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\"."
