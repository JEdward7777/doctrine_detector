## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! The term "woe" is used throughout the Bible, particularly in the context of God's judgment and the consequences of sin. Here are a few key examples of where "woe" appears, along with insights into what they reveal about God's judgment:

1. **Isaiah 5:8-9**: "Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field, till there is no room for others and you live alone in the land." 
   - In this passage, the "woe" highlights the judgment against greed and social injustice. It reveals God's disapproval of those who exploit others for their own gain, warning that this behavior will lead to dire consequences.

2. **Matthew 23:13-16**: "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to." 
   - Here, Jesus pronounces "woes" on the religious leaders for their hypocrisy and failure to lead the people toward God. This shows that God's judgment is often directed at those in authority who mislead others, indicating that accountability is heightened for leaders.

3. **Luke 6:24-26**: "But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort. Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep." 
   - In this passage from Lukeâ€™s Beatitudes, "woe" is a warning to those who are complacent and satisfied in their worldly wealth and comfort. It reveals that God's judgment will invert worldly values and bring justice, calling for repentance and humility.

4. **Revelation 18:10**: "Woe, woe, to you, great city, you mighty city of Babylon! In one hour your doom has come!" 
   - This "woe" is directed at Babylon, symbolizing the ultimate judgment against evil and corruption. It emphasizes the swift and total judgment of God against those who stand in opposition to His ways, reminding believers of the certainty of divine justice.

Overall, the term "woe" is used in the Scriptures to express God's serious displeasure with sin, warning both individuals and communities about the consequences of turning away from His ways. It serves as a call to repentance and the recognition of God's ultimate authority and justice.
