  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough examination of the term \"woe\" in the Bible and its implications for God's judgment. The student effectively references key passages from both the Old and New Testaments to illustrate the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. The analysis is clear, insightful, and aligns well with Christian teachings on repentance, divine justice, and accountability. The only room for improvement would be to further connect the concept of \"woe\" to the foundational doctrine of the Fall and mankind's need for redemption through Christ. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
