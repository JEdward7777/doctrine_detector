  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provided well-explained examples of how the term \"woe\" is used in the Bible to demonstrate God's judgment, they missed referencing key verses like Ezekiel 13:17-18 and Habakkuk 2:12 as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Including these additional verses would have further enriched the understanding of the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong grasp of the subject matter and effectively connected the concept of \"woe\" to God's judgment in various biblical contexts."
