## [Answer](../Building_Materials.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In biblical times, altars were constructed using various materials depending on the context and the specific requirements of the religious practices. Common materials included:

1. **Stones**: Uncut or unhewn stones were often used, as seen in Exodus 20:25, which prohibits the use of tools on the stones of the altar. This practice emphasized the altar's sanctity.

2. **Earth**: Simple earthen altars were also used, particularly in earlier periods or among nomadic groups, as referenced in Exodus 20:24.

3. **Wood**: Some altars were made of wood, especially those used for temporary or personal sacrifices.

4. **Metal**: In later periods, particularly with the construction of more elaborate temples, metal bases or coverings made of bronze or gold were used, as seen in the descriptions of the Temple in Jerusalem.

These materials reflect the significance of the altar as a place of worship and sacrifice, serving as a focal point for connecting with God. The choice of materials often had theological implications, highlighting themes of purity, dedication, and the divine.
