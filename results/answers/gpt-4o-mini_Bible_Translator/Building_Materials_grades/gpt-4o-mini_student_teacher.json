  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. \n\nThe student's response provides a comprehensive overview of the materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times, including stones, earth, wood, and metal. They accurately reference biblical passages to support their points and highlight the significance of these materials in conveying theological themes. While the answer goes into more detail and covers a wider range of materials compared to the reference answer, it aligns well with the concern of deepening understanding of biblical practices and reverence associated with worship. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong knowledge of the subject matter and effectively connects it to Christian worldview perspectives."
