  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer by citing relevant Bible verses that command believers to pursue personal sanctification. The response effectively emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process, aligning well with the Christian worldview. However, the reference answer succinctly captures the essence of the command regarding personal sanctification, while the student's answer could be slightly more focused and directly aligned with the specific concern given."
