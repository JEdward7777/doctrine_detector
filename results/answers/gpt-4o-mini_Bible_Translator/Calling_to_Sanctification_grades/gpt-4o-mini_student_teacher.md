## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Believers are commanded to pursue personal sanctification in several passages throughout the New Testament. A key verse is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3, which states, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality." 

Additionally, Hebrews 12:14 exhorts believers to "Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord." 

Moreover, 1 Peter 1:15-16 encourages believers to be "holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" 

These verses reflect that sanctification is both a process and a command for believers, calling them to live in a manner that is set apart and aligned with God's holiness.
