  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately reflects the biblical teaching that believers are commanded to pursue sanctification, using specific passages from the New Testament to support their argument. The emphasis on personal responsibility in the sanctification process is also explicitly stated, aligning well with the concern.\n\nHowever, while the response provides some good supporting evidence, it could be strengthened by further development of the idea and a clearer explanation of what this looks like practically in daily life. Additionally, there are no attempts to apply these biblical teachings to contemporary issues or cultural contexts, which might make the response feel somewhat abstract or disconnected from real-life scenarios.\n\nOverall, while the response is well-written and accurately reflects biblical teaching, it could be further developed to provide a more comprehensive and practical exploration of personal responsibility in sanctification."
