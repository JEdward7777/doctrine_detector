What command is given to believers regarding their personal sanctification?

## Correct Answer
Believers in Jesus are commanded to sanctify themselves to God and to be holy in everything they do.

## Stated Concern
Emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process.

## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Believers are commanded to pursue personal sanctification in several passages throughout the New Testament. A key verse is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3, which states, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality." 

Additionally, Hebrews 12:14 exhorts believers to "Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord." 

Moreover, 1 Peter 1:15-16 encourages believers to be "holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" 

These verses reflect that sanctification is both a process and a command for believers, calling them to live in a manner that is set apart and aligned with God's holiness.

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the personal responsibility of believers in the sanctification process. It accurately presents the biblical command for believers to sanctify themselves and be holy in everything they do, referencing relevant verses that support this idea. The only minor improvement could be providing some additional explanation or examples to further elaborate on the concept of personal responsibility in sanctification.
