The student effectively highlights key points such as God's initiative, the inclusion of Gentiles, Peter's transformation, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and the importance of baptism. The explanation is clear, well-supported with relevant scriptural references, and aligns with a Christian worldview by emphasizing God's plan to include all nations in His salvation."
