  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the hierarchical relationship between the chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Israelite worship. It correctly highlights the authority held by the chief priests, particularly the high priest, in overseeing Temple rituals and the Sanhedrin. Additionally, the distinction in roles and responsibilities between the chief priests and ordinary priests is well articulated. However, the response could have further emphasized the spiritual significance of this authority structure within the Jewish religious framework."
