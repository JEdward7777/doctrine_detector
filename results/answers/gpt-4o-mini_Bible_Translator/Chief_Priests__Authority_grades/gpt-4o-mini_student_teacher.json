  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the hierarchical relationship between the chief priests and the ordinary priests in ancient Israel. They correctly outlined the authority structure and roles of each group. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly stating that the high priest held the most authority among the chief priests, aligning more closely with the reference answer."
