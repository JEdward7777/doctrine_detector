## [Answer](../Chief_Priests__Authority.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of ancient Israelite worship, particularly during the time of the Second Temple, there was a distinct hierarchical relationship between the chief priests and the ordinary priests. 

The chief priests, often from the high priestly family, held a significant amount of authority. The high priest was the chief official responsible for the rituals and sacrifices in the Temple, and he presided over the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. The term "chief priests" typically refers not only to the high priest but also to other leading priests who had significant roles and responsibilities in the religious leadership and administration of the Temple.

Ordinary priests, often referred to as "kohanim," were members of the priestly caste descended from Aaron, the brother of Moses. Their primary responsibilities included performing sacrificial rites, maintaining the Temple, and assisting with the rituals prescribed in the Torah. While they had a privileged status as mediators between the people and God, their authority was subordinate to that of the chief priests.

In summary, the chief priests held a higher authority over the ordinary priests, guiding the religious practices, making significant decisions regarding Temple operations, and representing the priesthood in matters of governance. The ordinary priests executed the day-to-day duties of the Temple worship under the guidance and authority of the chief priests.
