It effectively addresses the concern regarding the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel by elaborating on the roles and responsibilities of both chief priests and ordinary priests. The explanation is thorough and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian-specific worldview. Great job!"
