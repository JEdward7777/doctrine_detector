## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible instructs children to honor their parents in several key passages. One of the most well-known verses is found in the Ten Commandments, specifically in Exodus 20:12, which states, "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you." This command underscores the importance God places on the parent-child relationship and reflects the value of respect and obedience within the family structure.

Additionally, in Ephesians 6:1-3, the Apostle Paul reiterates this command, saying, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—which is the first commandment with a promise—'so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.'" This passage emphasizes both the obligation to obey parents and the positive consequences that come from honoring them.

Colossians 3:20 also echoes the instruction: "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord." This indicates that honoring parents is not only a social or familial expectation but also a spiritual one.

Overall, the biblical instruction regarding how children should honor their parents encompasses obedience, respect, and acknowledgment of their authority, reflecting a commitment to family and obedience to God.
