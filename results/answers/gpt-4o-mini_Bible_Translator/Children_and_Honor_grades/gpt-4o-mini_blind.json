The references to Exodus 20:12, Ephesians 6:1-3, and Colossians 3:20 are appropriate and clearly support the points made about obedience, respect, and acknowledging parental authority. The answer effectively communicates the importance of honoring parents as a spiritual duty and a reflection of obedience to God. Great job!"
