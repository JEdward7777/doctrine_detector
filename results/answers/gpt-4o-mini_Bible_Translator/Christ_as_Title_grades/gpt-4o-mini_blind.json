  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and well-structured overview of how the term \"Christ\" evolved in its New Testament usage. The student effectively outlines the root meaning, initial usage, titles and roles, post-resurrection understanding, Pauline theology, early Christian identity, and eschatological significance of the term. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological development surrounding the term \"Christ\" throughout the New Testament. Great job! A higher grade could be achieved by further emphasizing the unique salvific role of Jesus as Christ and connecting it more explicitly to core Christian doctrines such as atonement and redemption."
