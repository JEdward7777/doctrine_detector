## [Answer](../Compassion_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Compassion in the Bible is often understood as a deep awareness of and sympathy for the sufferings and misfortunes of others, accompanied by a desire to alleviate that suffering. It reflects God’s character and is a crucial aspect of Christian teaching.

1. **Biblical Definition**: The term "compassion" is derived from the Hebrew word "rachamim," which is related to the root word for "womb," implying a deep, nurturing love. In the New Testament, the Greek word "σπλαγχνίζομαι" (splagchnizomai) conveys a similar sense of deep emotion, often described in the context of Jesus’s reactions to human suffering.

2. **Scriptural Examples**: Numerous passages illustrate compassion:
   - **God's Compassion**: Psalm 103:13 states, "As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him."
   - **Jesus’ Compassion**: Throughout the Gospels, Jesus exhibits compassion in multiple ways, such as when he heals the sick (Matthew 14:14) and feeds the hungry (Matthew 15:32).
   - **Parable of the Good Samaritan**: In Luke 10:25-37, the Samaritan feels compassion for the injured man and actively helps him, which illustrates what it means to love one's neighbor.

3. **Associated Actions**: Compassion in the Bible is often linked to practical actions:
   - **Help the Needy**: Demonstrating care through acts of kindness, providing for the poor, or visiting the sick (Matthew 25:35-40).
   - **Forgiveness and Understanding**: Treating others with grace, as seen in Ephesians 4:32, where believers are urged to be kind and compassionate, forgiving one another just as God forgave them.
   - **Empathy in Suffering**: Romans 12:15 encourages believers to "rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep," highlighting the call to share in others' emotional experiences.

In summary, compassion in the Bible encapsulates a heart of empathy that leads to action, reflecting God’s love and mercy towards humanity and encouraging believers to engage actively in the lives of others, especially those in need.
