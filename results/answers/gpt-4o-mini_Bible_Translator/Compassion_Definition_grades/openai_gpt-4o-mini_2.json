The integration of Hebrew and Greek language roots adds depth to the understanding of compassion, and the scriptural examples provided clearly illustrate how compassion is manifested in both God and Jesus. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the connection between biblical compassion and practical actions towards others, grounded in God's love and mercy. Strong theological insights and clear explanation make this a thorough and insightful analysis from a Christian perspective."
