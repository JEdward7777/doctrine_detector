  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides excellent biblical examples of compassion with detailed explanations and connections to real-life applications. The examples chosen effectively illustrate compassion as modeled by biblical figures, showing a strong understanding of how these narratives can inform compassionate behavior in the present day. The response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the specific examples provided in the answer (\"Daniel's refusal to defile himself, Hosea's love for an unfaithful spouse, and Jesus healing the sick\") to showcase the continuity between biblical teachings and contemporary compassion even further."
