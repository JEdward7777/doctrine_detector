Matthew 12:7 states, “If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent.” This verse emphasizes God's desire for mercy over mere ritualistic practices. The context indicates that Jesus is critiquing the Pharisees' strict interpretation of the law, suggesting that a heart of compassion should take precedence over rigid adherence to religious regulations. This teaching encourages believers to prioritize mercy and understanding in their judgments of others, rather than quickly moving to condemnation.

Psalm 34:22, on the other hand, says, “The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.” This verse highlights God's protective and redemptive nature, assuring that those who seek refuge in Him are safe from condemnation. It portrays God as a source of hope and deliverance for those who are faithful.

Together, these passages advocate for a perspective on punishment that is tempered by mercy and grace rather than one rooted solely in condemnation. They remind us that while accountability is important, it should be exercised with a spirit of compassion that seeks restoration rather than merely retribution. This aligns with the broader Christian teaching that emphasizes God's love and forgiveness, inviting believers to reflect that same attitude in their relations with others. 

In summary, Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 together shape a view of punishment that leans toward merciful correction rather than harsh condemnation, encouraging a spirit of grace in our interactions and judgments.
