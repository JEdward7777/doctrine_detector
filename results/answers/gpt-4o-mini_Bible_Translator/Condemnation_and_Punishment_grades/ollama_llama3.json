  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThis response accurately reflects the teachings of Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22, highlighting God's desire for mercy over sacrifice and His protective and redemptive nature. The author effectively combines these passages to emphasize a balanced approach to punishment that considers both justice and mercy. The summary statement nicely encapsulates the main point.\n\nWhile the response is well-organized and clearly written, it could be strengthened by more explicit connections between the biblical teachings and the concern about balancing divine justice and mercy in our understanding of punishment. Additionally, some additional depth or analysis on how these passages apply to real-world scenarios would enhance the response.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong effort that effectively communicates the biblical teachings and their relevance to the concern."
