  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the balance between divine justice and mercy in punishment as portrayed in the Bible. The references to Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 provide a solid foundation for the argument presented. The analysis of how these passages emphasize mercy, redemption, and protection in relation to punishment is well-supported and aligns with a Christian worldview. The response could be enhanced by incorporating more direct connections to the concern raised and by delving deeper into the theological implications of divine justice and mercy in punishment. Overall, it is a thoughtful and well-explained response."
