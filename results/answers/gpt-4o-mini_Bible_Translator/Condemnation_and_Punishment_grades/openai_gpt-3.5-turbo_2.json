  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively integrates the teachings of Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 to address the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in punishment. It presents a solid Christian perspective by highlighting the importance of mercy and compassion in judgment, while also acknowledging God's role in redemption and protection. The connection made between these passages and the broader Christian teaching on love and forgiveness demonstrates a sound understanding of Christian principles."
