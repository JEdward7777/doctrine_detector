  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a thoughtful analysis of the balance between divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment, drawing on specific biblical passages. The integration of Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 to advocate for a perspective that prioritizes mercy and grace in punishment aligns well with Christian teachings on forgiveness and compassion. The explanation is clear and presents a solid understanding of the Christian view on punishment."
