The student clearly articulates the two-part process of salvation, emphasizing the importance of both belief in the heart and confession with the mouth. The reference to other relevant passages from Paul's letters adds depth to the analysis, highlighting the role of the Holy Spirit in facilitating genuine faith and confession."
