## [Answer](../Confession_and_Salvation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Paul’s writings, particularly in Romans 10:9-10, he establishes a clear relationship between confessing that Jesus is Lord and salvation. The passage states: 

**"If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved."** (NIV)

From this passage, we can discern a two-part process essential for salvation:

1. **Belief in the Heart**: The first part involves a heartfelt belief in Jesus' resurrection and His identity as Lord. This belief signifies trust in Jesus’ redemptive work and His divine authority over life and death.

2. **Confession with the Mouth**: The second part involves confessing that Jesus is Lord. This verbal acknowledgment is an outward expression of one's inward faith. It indicates acceptance of Jesus not only as Savior but also as Lord, which implies submission to His authority and will.

Paul emphasizes that both belief and confession are crucial; they are interconnected and reflect a genuine faith. This duality suggests that true faith naturally results in a declaration of that faith.

Moreover, in other letters, such as 1 Corinthians 12:3, Paul underlines that no one can truly say "Jesus is Lord" except by the Holy Spirit, indicating that this confession is also evidence of the work of the Holy Spirit within a believer.

In summary, Paul's writings highlight that confessing Jesus as Lord, coupled with a belief in His resurrection, is integral to the salvation experience, showcasing the transformative power of faith in Christ.
