  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-reasoned answer on what Christians should do when faced with temptation to sin according to the Bible. They have referenced relevant verses and provided practical steps to resist temptation. However, the student's response could be improved by emphasizing the importance of confessing personal sins in relation to God's forgiveness, as highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging the acknowledgment of personal sin and reliance on God's forgiveness would strengthen the Christian perspective on dealing with temptation."
