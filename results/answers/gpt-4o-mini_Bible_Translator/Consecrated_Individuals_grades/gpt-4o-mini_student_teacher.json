  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of individuals consecrated to God in the Bible, including key figures like Samuel, Nazirites, Jeremiah, John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Levites, illustrating dedication to God's purposes. However, the student missed mentioning the priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child, as stated in the reference answer. Integrating these key examples would have further enhanced the response."
