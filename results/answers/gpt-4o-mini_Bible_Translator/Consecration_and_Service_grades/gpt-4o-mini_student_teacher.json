  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough and insightful explanation of how consecration prepares individuals or things for God's service, their response did not fully address the concern regarding understanding the purification process that comes with consecration. The student did mention purification indirectly through points such as recognition of holiness and separation from common use, but a more explicit explanation of the cleansing aspect would have been beneficial.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and provided relevant biblical references to support their points. With a more direct focus on the purification aspect of consecration, their answer could have been even stronger."
