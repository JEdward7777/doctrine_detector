  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provided significantly expands on the concept of consecration beyond just cleansing and making individuals or things acceptable for service to God. It delves into the deeper theological implications of consecration, including the recognition of holiness, intentionality, separation from common use, empowerment for service, covenantal relationship, and the ultimate purpose of service and worship. The explanation is thorough, well-supported with biblical references, and demonstrates a holistic understanding of consecration within the Christian worldview."
