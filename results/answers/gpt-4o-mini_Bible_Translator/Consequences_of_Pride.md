## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible has much to say about the consequences of pride and the importance of humility. 

1. **Consequences of Pride:**
   - Pride is often portrayed negatively in Scripture. For instance, Proverbs 16:18 states, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." This verse highlights that pride can lead to one's downfall and ruin.
   - James 4:6 emphasizes that "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." This indicates that a proud heart is in opposition to God, whereas humility is seen as a virtue that draws God's favor.
   - In Proverbs 11:2, it says, "When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom." This suggests that pride can lead to shame and a lack of wisdom.

2. **Importance of Humility:**
   - Humility is consistently advocated throughout the Bible. Jesus exemplified humility, and in Philippians 2:3-4, Paul instructs believers to "do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves."
   - Micah 6:8 summarizes what the Lord requires of His people, stating that they are to "act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God." This verse emphasizes humility as essential in one's relationship with God.
   - Jesus teaches that those who humble themselves will be exalted. In Luke 14:11, He says, "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."

Overall, the Bible teaches that pride leads to destruction and disgrace, while humility is honored by God and is crucial for a right relationship with Him and others. Embracing humility fosters a spirit of love, servitude, and a deeper understanding of God's presence in our lives.
