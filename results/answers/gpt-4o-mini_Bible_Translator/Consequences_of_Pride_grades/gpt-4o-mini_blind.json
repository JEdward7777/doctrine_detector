The references to specific verses such as Proverbs 16:18, James 4:6, and Philippians 2:3-4 demonstrate a good foundation in Scripture. The explanation is clear and well-supported, emphasizing the negative effects of pride and the positive attributes of humility according to Christian teachings. Great job!"
