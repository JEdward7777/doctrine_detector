## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Ark of the Covenant, as described in the Bible, contained three primary items:

1. **The Tablets of the Law**: These are the two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed, which God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25:16; Deuteronomy 10:1-5).

2. **Aaron's Rod**: This was the rod or staff belonging to Aaron, which miraculously budded as a sign of his chosen leadership among the Israelites (Numbers 17:10). 

3. **A Golden Jar of Manna**: This jar contained a sample of manna, the bread-like substance that God provided to the Israelites during their 40 years in the wilderness (Exodus 16:32-34).

These items represented God's covenant with His people and His provision for them. The Ark also served as a symbol of God's presence among the Israelites and was housed in the Most Holy Place of the Tabernacle.
