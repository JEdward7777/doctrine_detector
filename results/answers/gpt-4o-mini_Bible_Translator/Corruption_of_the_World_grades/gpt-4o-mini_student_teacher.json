  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response, incorporating various biblical principles and teachings to identify corrupt influences in the world. They emphasized the importance of Scripture, prayer, discernment, community accountability, and moral standards, all of which are essential for Christians to remain vigilant against worldly influences. The student effectively addressed the concern by providing practical ways for Christians to discern and resist corrupt influences. While their answer aligns closely with the reference answer, it could have been strengthened by explicitly emphasizing behaviors and attitudes that promote selfishness and sin, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer."
