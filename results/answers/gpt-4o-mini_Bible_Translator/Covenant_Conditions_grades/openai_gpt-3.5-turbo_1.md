# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, covenants are significant agreements made between God and humans, and they can be categorized into conditional and unconditional covenants.

### Conditional Covenants

1. **The Mosaic Covenant**: Established between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-24), this covenant required the Israelites to follow God's laws (the Ten Commandments and other regulations). The blessings of the covenant were contingent upon their obedience (Deuteronomy 28).

2. **The Davidic Covenant**: While the promise made to David contains unconditional elements, it also includes conditional aspects concerning the faithfulness of David's descendants. God promises David that his lineage will endure, but there are consequences if they turn away from Him (2 Samuel 7:14-15).

3. **The Covenant with Noah (Post-Flood)**: The promise that God would never again destroy the earth by flood is considered an unconditional covenant, but the requirement for humanity to be fruitful and multiply (Genesis 9:1) implies a conditional aspect regarding human behavior.

### Unconditional Covenants

1. **The Abrahamic Covenant**: This covenant, found in Genesis 12, 15, and 17, declares God's promise to Abraham to make him a great nation, bless him, and give his descendants the land of Canaan. This promise is unconditional because it is based solely on God's faithfulness, not on any condition that Abraham must fulfill.

2. **The New Covenant**: Established through Jesus Christ, as described in Jeremiah 31:31-34 and fulfilled in the New Testament (particularly in Luke 22:20), this covenant is unconditional in that it guarantees salvation and eternal life to all who put their faith in Christ, irrespective of one's actions, as salvation is a work of grace.

3. **The Covenant with Noah (Rainbow Promise)**: After the Flood, God made a promise to Noah and all living creatures that He would never again destroy the earth with a flood, symbolized by the rainbow (Genesis 9:11-17). This is an unconditional promise demonstrating God's mercy.

These covenants illustrate the diverse ways in which God relates to humanity, emphasizing both His justice and mercy throughout biblical history.
