## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Jewish view of Gentiles (non-Jews) in ancient times was shaped by a mixture of cultural, religious, and social factors. These views and practices significantly impacted early Christian practices as the movement began to spread beyond its Jewish roots.

### Cultural Practices and Views

1. **Purity Laws**: Jewish identity and social practices were heavily influenced by laws of ritual purity. Many Jews believed that interacting too closely with Gentiles could lead to ritual contamination. This meant avoiding certain foods, shared meals, and even social gatherings.

2. **Food Restrictions**: Adhering to kosher dietary laws was central to Jewish identity. Foods that were not prepared according to Jewish laws or that derived from Gentiles were often avoided. This created a strong boundary between Jews and Gentiles.

3. **Synagogal Life**: In Jewish communities, Gentiles could attend synagogue services, but they often had a secondary role to Jewish followers. There were specific groups of Gentiles, like God-fearers (Gentiles who were attracted to Judaism but did not fully convert), who were more integrated into Jewish worship.

4. **Intermarriage**: Jewish law generally prohibited intermarriage with Gentiles, as such unions were seen as threats to Jewish identity and faithfulness to the covenant with God.

5. **Messianic Expectations**: Jews anticipated a Messiah who would restore Israel and establish God’s kingdom. This often included an expectation that Gentiles would eventually be incorporated into God’s plan, but under the leadership of the Jewish people.

### Impact on Early Christian Practices

1. **Jewish Roots**: Early Christians were predominantly Jewish and retained many Jewish cultural practices, including worship in synagogues and adherence to certain Jewish laws.

2. **Gentile Inclusion**: The significant turning point came with the missionary efforts of figures like the Apostle Paul, who argued that Gentiles did not need to fully convert to Judaism (including following ritual laws such as circumcision) to be saved and included in the Christian community. This was influenced by experiences such as the vision of Peter in Acts 10, where he was shown that God does not show favoritism.

3. **Food and Fellowship**: The early church initially maintained some Jewish dietary laws and practices. However, as the number of Gentile believers increased, debates arose regarding food practices, exemplified by the Jerusalem Council's decision (Acts 15) to allow Gentiles certain freedoms from these practices, which facilitated more inclusive fellowship.

4. **Theological Development**: Early Christian theology developed in a context where the inclusion of Gentiles was a major theme. This resulted in theological frameworks where salvation was understood as available to all, irrespective of ethnic background (as articulated by Paul in letters like Galatians).

5. **Ethical Teachings**: Early Christianity emphasized love and acceptance, reconstructing social boundaries for gatherings, meals, and community life, which included Gentiles as equals in Christ.

Overall, while the initial Jewish view of Gentiles created barriers, the early Christian movement worked to overcome these barriers through a broader understanding of God’s covenant and grace, leading to a more inclusive identity that embraced both Jews and Gentiles as part of the one body of Christ.
