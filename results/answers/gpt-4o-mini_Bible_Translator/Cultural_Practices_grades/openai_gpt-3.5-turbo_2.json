The response effectively addresses the concern regarding how cultural norms influence faith communities, demonstrating how these norms shaped the development of the early church and the discussions on inclusivity and acceptance. The connection between cultural practices, theological developments, and ethical teachings is well-explained, leading to a thorough examination of the topic. The only minor area for improvement could be a more explicit connection to how God's design and sovereign plan influenced these cultural norms and subsequent Christian responses."
