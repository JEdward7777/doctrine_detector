It correctly identifies the theological importance of the passage, discusses the background context, and articulates the role of the law in highlighting disobedience. The student appropriately ties in the redemptive work of Christ to highlight the grace of God in salvation. The explanation is doctrinally sound and well-supported by Scripture. Great job!"
