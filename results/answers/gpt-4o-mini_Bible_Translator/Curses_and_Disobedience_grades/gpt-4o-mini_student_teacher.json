  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 80. \n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of the passage in Galatians 3:10 and its context, they did not sufficiently emphasize the seriousness of disobedience to God's commands. Additionally, although they correctly pointed out the role of Christ in bearing the curse of the law for believers, they could have further highlighted the importance of recognizing the gravity of disobedience and the need for repentance and striving for obedience in light of God's judgment."
