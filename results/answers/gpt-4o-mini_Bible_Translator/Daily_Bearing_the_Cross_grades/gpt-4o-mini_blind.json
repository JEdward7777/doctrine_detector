They effectively explain the importance of self-denial, the symbolism behind taking up the cross, the daily commitment required, and the ultimate goal of following Jesus. The answer could have been enhanced by including more references to scripture to support their points and by delving deeper into the theological implications of this concept. Overall, a well-articulated and doctrinally sound response."
