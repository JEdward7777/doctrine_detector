  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the significance and implications of the 'day of the Lord' for believers. They provide a comprehensive explanation of the concept in the New Testament, highlighting themes of divine judgment, the second coming of Christ, and the need for vigilance among believers. The inclusion of specific scriptural references adds depth to their response. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by connecting the concept more directly to the significance for believers in terms of spiritual preparation and the urgency of living a faithful life in light of the impending return of Christ."
