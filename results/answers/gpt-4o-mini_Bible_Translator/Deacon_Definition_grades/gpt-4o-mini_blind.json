  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of the primary role of a deacon in the local church, emphasizing the importance of service, practical assistance, spiritual care, and upholding doctrinal integrity. The mention of biblical examples, such as Acts 6:1-6, adds a strong foundation to the explanation. However, to enhance the doctrinal correctness, the response could have delved deeper into the scriptural qualifications for deacons as outlined in 1 Timothy 3:8-13. Additionally, emphasizing the servant-leadership aspect of a deacon, who is called to model humility and selflessness in serving others, would further enrich the answer."
