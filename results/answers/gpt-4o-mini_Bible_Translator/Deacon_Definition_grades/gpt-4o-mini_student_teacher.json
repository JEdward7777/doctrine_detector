  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the primary role of a deacon in the local church. They effectively addressed the biblical concept of servanthood and highlighted various aspects of a deacon's responsibilities. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on the practical aspect of serving fellow believers with needs, as per the reference answer given by the teacher."
