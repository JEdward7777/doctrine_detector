However, the full understanding of the role of a deacon extends beyond just assisting with practical needs, as reflected in the detailed explanation provided in the original response. Additionally, the biblical references and broader responsibilities of deacons in supporting the ministry and care of the congregation are essential to grasp the complete picture of the servant leadership role within the church."
