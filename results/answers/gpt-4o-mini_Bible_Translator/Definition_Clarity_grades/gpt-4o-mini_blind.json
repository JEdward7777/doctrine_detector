It accurately references key passages from both the Old and New Testaments to illustrate the seriousness of adultery as a violation of the marital covenant. The inclusion of the expanded definition of adultery by Jesus in Matthew 5:27-28 is particularly insightful and adds depth to the explanation. The conclusion effectively summarizes the key points and emphasizes the spiritual and moral implications of adultery. Great job!"
