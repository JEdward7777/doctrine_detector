They referenced key passages from both the Old and New Testaments, demonstrating a solid understanding of the biblical definition and implications of adultery. The integration of verses such as Exodus 20:14, Matthew 5:27-28, Proverbs 6:32, and Hebrews 13:4 effectively reinforces the seriousness of adultery as a sin in the Christian worldview. The inclusion of the spiritual and moral dimensions of adultery, beyond just the physical act, further enriched their response. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful answer."
