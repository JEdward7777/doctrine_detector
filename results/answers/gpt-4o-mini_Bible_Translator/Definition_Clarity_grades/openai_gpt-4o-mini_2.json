  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Biblical definition and implications of adultery within a Christian context. It effectively references key passages from both the Old and New Testaments to support the definition provided and includes insight into the broader spiritual and moral dimensions of adultery. The response could be further enhanced by providing additional examples or explanations, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
