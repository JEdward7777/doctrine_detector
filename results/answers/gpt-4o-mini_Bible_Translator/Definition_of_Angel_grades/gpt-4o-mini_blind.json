  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid overview of the biblical definition of angels and their primary roles according to the Bible. The answer effectively covers key aspects such as messengers, protectors, servants of God's will, worshippers, and their involvement in spiritual warfare. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included more scriptural references to support each point and further strengthen the doctrinal foundation of the explanation. Adding more explicit references to specific biblical instances of angelic actions would enhance the answer's clarity and doctrinal correctness."
