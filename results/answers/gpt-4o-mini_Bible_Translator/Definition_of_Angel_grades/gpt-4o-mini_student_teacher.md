## [Answer](../Definition_of_Angel.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, angels are typically defined as spiritual beings created by God who serve as His messengers and servants. The term "angel" comes from the Greek word "angelos," which means "messenger." In the Hebrew Bible, the word for angel is "malakh," which carries a similar meaning.

The primary roles of angels in the Bible include:

1. **Messengers**: Angels often deliver messages from God to humans. For example, the angel Gabriel announced the birth of Jesus to Mary (Luke 1:26-38) and conveyed messages to Zechariah and the shepherds (Luke 1:11-20; 2:9-14).

2. **Protectors and Guardians**: Angels are portrayed as guardians, watching over and protecting individuals or nations. Psalm 91:11-12 states, "For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways."

3. **Servants of God's Will**: Angels serve God's purposes and carry out His commands. They are seen executing judgment (Genesis 19:13; Revelation 7:1) and providing help or support during important events (Acts 12:7-10).

4. **Worshippers**: Angels also engage in worship and praise of God. In Isaiah 6:1-3, seraphim are depicted as praising God in His presence, and in Revelation 4:8, four living creatures are shown worshipping God continuously.

5. **Spiritual Warfare**: Angels are involved in spiritual battles against evil forces. Ephesians 6:12 indicates that believers are in a struggle against spiritual forces, implying the involvement of angels in this conflict.

Overall, angels are seen as servants of God's will, helping to bridge the divine and human realms while carrying out tasks aligned with Godâ€™s purposes.
