  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns with the Christian view of what it means to be a believer in Christ. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses to support their points is commendable. However, there was some excess detail beyond the essential definition provided by the teacher, which is why the grade is slightly lower."
