In the New Testament, the term 'church' (from the Greek word "ekklesia") primarily refers to the body of believers who are called out to follow Jesus Christ. The term can have several connotations:

1. **Local Congregations**: The term often refers to specific local gatherings of Christians. For example, in the letters of Paul, he addresses specific congregations, such as the "church in Corinth" (1 Corinthians 1:2) or the "church of the Thessalonians" (1 Thessalonians 1:1). 

2. **The Universal Church**: The term also signifies the universal body of believers throughout all time who are united in faith in Christ. This is reflected in passages like Ephesians 1:22-23, which describes the church as the body of Christ, with Christ as its head.

3. **The Church as a Spiritual Entity**: The church is understood as a spiritual community that transcends physical location. It encompasses all true believers, making it more than just a physical building or institution.

4. **The Church's Purpose**: The church is portrayed as having a mission to worship God, proclaim the gospel, teach and disciple believers, and serve others (Matthew 28:19-20, Acts 2:42-47).

In summary, in the New Testament, the term 'church' refers to both local assemblies of believers and the universal body of Christ, emphasizing spiritual unity, mission, and community among those who follow Christ.
