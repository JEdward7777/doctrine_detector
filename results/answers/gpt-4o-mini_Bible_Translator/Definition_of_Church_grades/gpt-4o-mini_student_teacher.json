  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive understanding of the term 'church' in the New Testament, covering various aspects such as local congregations, the universal church, the church as a spiritual entity, and the church's purpose. They correctly emphasize that the church is more than just a building or institution but a body of believers united in faith and mission. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview in highlighting the spiritual nature and mission of the church.\n\nThe minor deduction in the grade is due to the inclusion of some additional elaboration beyond what was specifically asked in the reference answer. While the student's response is thorough and accurate, it could be slightly more concise by focusing solely on the given question and concern. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of the church in the New Testament."
