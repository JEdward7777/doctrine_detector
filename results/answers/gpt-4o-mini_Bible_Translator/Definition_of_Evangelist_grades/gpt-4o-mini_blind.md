## [Answer](../Definition_of_Evangelist.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The term 'evangelist' comes from the Greek word "euangelistes," which is derived from "euangelion," meaning "good news" or "gospel." Literally, an evangelist is someone who brings good news or proclaims the gospel. In a Christian context, this term traditionally refers to the authors of the four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—who spread the message of Jesus Christ. Additionally, it can refer more broadly to anyone who preaches or shares the Christian message.
