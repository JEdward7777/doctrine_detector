The Bible describes the characteristics and nature of God in various ways throughout both the Old and New Testaments. Here are some key attributes and characteristics of God as understood in Christian theology:

1. **Omnipotence**: God is all-powerful, able to do all things that are consistent with His nature. This is emphasized in verses like Jeremiah 32:17, which states, “Ah, Lord God! It is You who have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for You.”

2. **Omniscience**: God is all-knowing, aware of all things past, present, and future. Psalm 147:5 says, “Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; His understanding is beyond measure.”

3. **Omnipresence**: God is present everywhere at all times. Psalm 139:7-8 expresses this, stating, “Where shall I go from Your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from Your presence? If I ascend to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there.”

4. **Immutability**: God does not change. Malachi 3:6 declares, “For I the Lord do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed.”

5. **Holiness**: God is utterly holy, separated from sin and morally pure. Isaiah 6:3 captures this, saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!”

6. **Love**: The essence of God’s nature is love. 1 John 4:8 states, “Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.”

7. **Justice**: God is just and righteous. Deuteronomy 32:4 emphasizes His nature as just, declaring, “The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is He.”

8. **Mercy and Grace**: God is merciful and gracious, forgiving sin and offering salvation. Ephesians 2:8-9 conveys this truth with, “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God.”

9. **Faithfulness**: God is faithful and keeps His promises. Lamentations 3:22-23 exclaims, “The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.”

10. **Sovereignty**: God is sovereign over all creation, actively ruling and sustaining it. Psalm 103:19 affirms this, saying, “The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all.”

These attributes reflect the complexity and richness of God's nature as portrayed throughout Scripture. Together, they form a comprehensive understanding of who God is in Christian theology.
