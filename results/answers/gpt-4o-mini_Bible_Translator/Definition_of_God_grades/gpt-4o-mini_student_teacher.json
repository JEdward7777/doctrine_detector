  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of various attributes and characteristics of God as described in the Bible. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes the trinitarian nature of God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) which the student did not explicitly mention. Understanding and acknowledging the trinitarian nature of God is crucial in Christian theology, therefore, the student's answer could have been improved by including this aspect."
