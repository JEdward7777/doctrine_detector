  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that effectively contrasts the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil' within the context of God's character and moral standards. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the moral implications of these concepts in daily decision-making, while also incorporating relevant biblical references to support the explanation. The only area for improvement would be to directly address the reference answer from the teacher and maybe include a bit more of a direct comparison with it."
