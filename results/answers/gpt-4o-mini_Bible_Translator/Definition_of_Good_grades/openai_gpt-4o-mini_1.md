## [Answer](../Definition_of_Good.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the definition of 'good' is deeply rooted in the character and nature of God. The term 'good' often aligns with righteousness, holiness, and alignment with God's will. For instance, in Genesis 1, after creating each part of the world, God declares His creation "good" (Genesis 1:31 states that everything He made was "very good"). This suggests that 'good' reflects God's order, purpose, and perfection.

In contrast, the concept of 'evil' in the Bible is typically associated with sin, disobedience to God, and anything that disrupts the created order. Evil is seen as the absence or distortion of good. For example, in Isaiah 5:20, it warns against calling evil good and good evil, highlighting a moral inversion that leads to chaos and separation from God. The Bible often presents evil as a force that opposes God's goodness, leading humanity away from His intended purpose.

Moreover, evil is personified in various ways, such as through Satan, who embodies rebellion against God's authority (John 10:10), and through sinful actions that originate in the human heart (Mark 7:21-23). Therefore, the struggle between good and evil is a central theme in the biblical narrative, culminating in the victory of Christ over sin and death, which offers redemption and restoration to those who believe.

In summary, 'good' corresponds with God's nature and His intended order for creation, whereas 'evil' represents rebellion against that order, leading to brokenness and separation from God. This contrast underscores the moral framework within which biblical theology operates.
