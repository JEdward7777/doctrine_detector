## [Answer](../Definition_of_Gospel.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The term 'gospel' is derived from the Old English word 'godspel,' which means 'good news' or 'glad tidings.' This, in turn, is a translation of the Greek word 'euangelion' (εὐαγγέλιον), which also means 'good news' or 'good message.'

In the context of the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the term 'gospel' is primarily understood as the good news of Jesus Christ—his life, death, resurrection, and the salvation offered to humanity through faith in Him. The gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John specifically narrate the life and teachings of Jesus, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and Savior. 

Furthermore, the gospel encompasses the message of God's kingdom, the call to repentance, and the promise of eternal life through belief in Jesus Christ (John 3:16). It serves as a foundation for Christian doctrine, highlighting God's love and grace and the invitation to have a relationship with Him through faith. 

In a broader sense, the term 'gospel' can also refer to the entirety of the Christian message and all that flows from it, including the implications for living a life of discipleship. Thus, the gospel is both a message of salvation and the basis for the Christian life.
