It effectively addresses the concern regarding understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place by exploring the structure of worship, representation of God's presence, sacred items, priestly role, and symbolism of holiness associated with the holy place. The insights shared are supported by relevant biblical references and demonstrate a solid understanding of how the holy place symbolizes the relationship between God and His people. Great job!"
