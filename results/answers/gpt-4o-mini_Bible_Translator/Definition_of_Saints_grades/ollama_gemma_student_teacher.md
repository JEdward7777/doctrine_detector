## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of the New Testament, the term 'saints' generally refers to those who have been set apart for God and are considered holy or consecrated. It is derived from the Greek word "hagios," which means 'holy' or 'sacred.'

The usage of 'saints' in the New Testament primarily denotes members of the Christian communityâ€”those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and are called to live according to His teachings. For instance, Paul often addresses his letters to "the saints" in the various congregations he writes to (e.g., Romans 1:7, 1 Corinthians 1:2, Ephesians 1:1), highlighting their identity as followers of Christ.

Moreover, the term emphasizes both a present reality and a future hope; while believers are considered saints because of their faith in Christ, they are also called to live out their identity in holiness and righteousness, reflecting the character of God. This notion of living as saints is further supported by passages that encourage believers to pursue holiness (e.g., 1 Peter 1:15-16).

In summary, 'saints' in the New Testament refers to Christians who are called to be holy and are recognized as such by virtue of their relationship with Christ, both now and in anticipation of their ultimate sanctification.
