  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a comprehensive and well-explained answer on sanctification according to the Bible. The student has accurately outlined the key aspects of sanctification, incorporating relevant biblical references. One area for improvement could be to emphasize the role of grace in sanctification, as it is through God's grace that believers are empowered to grow in holiness. Additionally, the student could explore the concept of positional sanctification further to deepen the theological understanding of sanctification. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound response."
