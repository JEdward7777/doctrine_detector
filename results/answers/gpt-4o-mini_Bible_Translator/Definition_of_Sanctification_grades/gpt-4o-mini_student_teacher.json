  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer an 80. \n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of sanctification according to the Bible, including its various aspects such as separation for God, purification, spiritual growth, positional and progressive sanctification, and ultimate sanctification, the answer could have been more concise and focused. The biblical definition of sanctification boils down to the act of setting apart or making holy, as mentioned in the reference answer. The student's elaboration is informative and accurate, but it could have been improved by emphasizing the core biblical definition more prominently."
