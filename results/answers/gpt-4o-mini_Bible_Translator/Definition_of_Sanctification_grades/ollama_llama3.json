However, it lacks depth and clarity in explaining the biblical definition of sanctification. The provided answer only scratches the surface by mentioning a process of being made holy, but fails to elaborate on the various aspects of sanctification mentioned in the Bible, such as separation for God, purification and holiness, spiritual growth, positional and progressive sanctification, and ultimate sanctification. To better address the concern of understanding the biblical definition of sanctification, future responses should provide more comprehensive explanations and examples from Scripture."
