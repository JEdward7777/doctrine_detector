## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, to sanctify or to be sanctified generally means to be set apart for a holy purpose or for God's use. The concept of sanctification encompasses several key ideas:

1. **Separation for God**: To sanctify something is to dedicate it for God's purposes. In the Old Testament, the priests, certain objects, and even days (like the Sabbath) were set apart as holy to the Lord (Exodus 19:6; Exodus 20:8-11).

2. **Purification and Holiness**: Sanctification implies a process of purification and becoming holy. This involves moral and spiritual cleansing from sin and bringing one's life into alignment with God's will (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

3. **Spiritual Growth**: Sanctification is also about growth in spiritual maturity and the development of Christlike character through the work of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). The New Testament teaches that believers are being continually transformed into the image of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18).

4. **Positionally and Progressively**: In Christian theology, sanctification can be understood in two ways:
   - **Positional Sanctification**: This happens at the moment of salvation when a believer is declared holy and set apart by God (1 Corinthians 1:2). This is often referred to as the believer's standing before God.
   - **Progressive Sanctification**: This describes the ongoing process of growing in holiness throughout a believer's life, which involves both divine assistance and human cooperation (Philippians 2:12-13).

5. **Ultimate Sanctification**: The New Testament also speaks of a future aspect of sanctification, where believers will be fully sanctified at the return of Christ, inheriting a glorified state free from sin (1 Thessalonians 5:23).

Overall, sanctification is a key aspect of the Christian faith that highlights the transformation that occurs as one grows closer to Christ and lives out Godâ€™s will.

Comment: The response provides some insight into the concept of sanctification, acknowledging that it involves setting something apart or making it holy. However, it lacks depth and clarity in explaining the biblical definition of sanctification. The provided answer only scratches the surface by mentioning a process of being made holy, but fails to elaborate on the various aspects of sanctification mentioned in the Bible, such as separation for God, purification and holiness, spiritual growth, positional and progressive sanctification, and ultimate sanctification. To better address the concern of understanding the biblical definition of sanctification, future responses should provide more comprehensive explanations and examples from Scripture.
