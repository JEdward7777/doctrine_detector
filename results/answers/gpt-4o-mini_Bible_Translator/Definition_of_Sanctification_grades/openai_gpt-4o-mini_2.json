  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the biblical concept of sanctification, covering various aspects such as separation for God, purification, spiritual growth, positional and progressive sanctification, and the ultimate sanctification. It effectively expands on the simple definition provided in the answer and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be adding more scriptural references to support the points made, but overall, this is an excellent response."
