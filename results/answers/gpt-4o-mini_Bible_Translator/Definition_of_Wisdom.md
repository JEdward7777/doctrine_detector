## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the biblical context, wisdom is a multifaceted concept deeply rooted in the fear of the Lord and the application of knowledge in a way that aligns with God's will. Here are some key aspects of wisdom as defined in Scripture:

1. **Fear of the Lord**: Proverbs 1:7 states, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction." This indicates that true wisdom starts with a reverent relationship with God, recognizing His authority, power, and holiness.

2. **Understanding and Discernment**: Wisdom involves understanding the nature of God and His creation, as well as discerning right from wrong. Proverbs 2:6 tells us, "For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding." It suggests that wisdom is a gift from God, imparting clarity and insight into life’s complexities.

3. **Practical Application**: Wisdom is not just theoretical knowledge but is practical in nature. It instructs how to live righteously and make good choices. James 3:13 asks, "Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom." This highlights that wisdom manifests in actions and ethical behavior.

4. **Counsel and Guidance**: In Proverbs 11:14, it’s written, "Where there is no counsel, the people fall; but in the multitude of counselors, there is safety." Here, wisdom is associated with seeking advice and guidance, suggesting that wise individuals value the input of others and the community.

5. **Enduring Character**: Biblically, wisdom is also tied to character and conduct. Wise individuals are often portrayed as having traits such as humility, patience, and integrity. Proverbs 3:13-18 describes the blessings that come from finding wisdom and emphasizes its preciousness.

6. **Eternal Perspective**: Wisdom involves recognizing the temporality of earthly life compared to the eternal nature of spiritual life. Colossians 3:2 advises believers to "Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth." This reflects a wise perspective that values eternal truths over temporal concerns.

In summary, biblical wisdom is rooted in a relationship with God, characterized by understanding, practical application in daily life, and an emphasis on moral integrity and seeking counsel. It is essential for making decisions that reflect God’s purposes and align with His character.
