  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the biblical concept of wisdom, highlighting its multifaceted nature and various aspects as defined in Scripture. The author demonstrates a good understanding of the concept by citing relevant passages from Proverbs and other books of the Bible. The response also effectively connects the biblical concept of wisdom to everyday life, emphasizing its importance for making decisions that align with God's will.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in terms of clarity and concision. While the author presents a well-organized and coherent argument, some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for easier reading. Additionally, the response could benefit from more explicit connections to the concern provided. For example, the author could explicitly state how understanding the biblical concept of wisdom is crucial for making decisions that align with God's will.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively explores the biblical concept of wisdom and its relevance to everyday life."
