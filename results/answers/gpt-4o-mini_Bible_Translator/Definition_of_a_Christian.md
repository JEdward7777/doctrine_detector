## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Christian" is derived from the Greek word "Christianos," which means "follower of Christ." Biblically, a Christian is a person who has accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and has committed to following His teachings and example.

Several key aspects define a Christian in the Bible:

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: A central tenet is belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity. This is emphasized in passages like John 3:16, which states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

2. **Repentance from Sin**: True faith involves repentance—a turning away from sin and a commitment to live according to God’s will. In Acts 2:38, Peter calls on the people to "repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins."

3. **Living According to Christ's Teachings**: Christians are called to embody the teachings of Jesus and the principles of love, service, and obedience found in the New Testament. For example, in John 14:15, Jesus states, "If you love me, keep my commands."

4. **Involvement in the Community of Believers**: Christians are typically part of a community known as the Church, which is called to fellowship, worship, and support one another. Hebrews 10:24-25 encourages believers to meet together and spur one another on toward love and good deeds.

5. **Transformation of Life**: Being a Christian also implies a transformed life marked by the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23), which includes love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

In summary, a Christian is someone who believes in Christ, repents of sin, follows His teachings, participates in the church community, and experiences a transformative relationship with God through the Holy Spirit.
