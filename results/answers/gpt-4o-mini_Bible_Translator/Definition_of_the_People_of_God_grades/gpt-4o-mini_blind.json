The explanation of the covenantal relationship, identity, obedience to the law, worship practices, mission to the nations, and hope of restoration is thorough and aligned with Christian doctrine. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the significance of faith as a central aspect of being part of the people of God, as faith is a key component in one's relationship with God throughout the Old Testament."
