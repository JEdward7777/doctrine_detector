  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of providing clear definitions for each term, including biblical examples to illustrate their meanings. It also correctly identifies the nuances between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" in a Christian context, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between urging action, offering support, and correcting misbehavior.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture, providing examples from Philippians 4:1, Hebrews 10:24-25, and Galatians 6:1. The summary at the end also helps to tie everything together nicely, emphasizing that each term has its own unique purpose and significance.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response could be more detailed in its explanations. For example, it might be helpful to explore further how these terms are used throughout Scripture, or to provide more specific examples of when each term is most appropriate. Additionally, while the response does a good job of providing biblical examples, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the definitions and scriptural passages.\n\nOverall, though, this is a strong response that effectively clarifies the meanings and uses of \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" in a Christian context."
