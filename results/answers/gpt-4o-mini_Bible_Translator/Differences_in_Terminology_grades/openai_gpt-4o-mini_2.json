  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the differences between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" in a Christian context, aligning with a scriptural perspective. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the biblical basis for each form of encouragement. The only minor improvement could be to provide more specific scriptural references for the definitions given in the original answer. Overall, well-done in incorporating Christian principles and teachings."
