  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of why the twelve apostles were chosen as Jesus' closest disciples from a theological perspective. It effectively covers various aspects such as divine selection, representation of Israel, intimate training, empowerment for ministry, diversity of backgrounds, and fulfillment of prophecy. The integration of relevant biblical references enhances the answer's credibility. However, to improve, the response could have delved deeper into the specific roles and characteristics of each apostle within Jesus' inner circle to further enrich the discussion."
