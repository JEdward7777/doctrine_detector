They effectively highlighted key reasons such as divine selection, representation of Israel, intimate training and relationship, empowerment for ministry, diversity of backgrounds, and fulfillment of prophecy. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on directly addressing the concern of the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, rather than delving into additional details. The reference answer is more concise and directly addresses the core reason for the selection of the apostles."
