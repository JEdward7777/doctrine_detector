## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The choice of the twelve apostles by Jesus as His closest disciples is significant for several reasons, both theological and practical.

1. **Divine Selection**: According to the Gospels, Jesus chose the twelve apostles after spending time in prayer, implying that their selection was divinely ordained (Luke 6:12-13). This highlights the importance of the apostles in God's plan for salvation and the establishment of the early Church.

2. **Representation of Israel**: The number twelve is often associated with the twelve tribes of Israel. By selecting twelve apostles, Jesus symbolically aimed to signify a new Israel or a renewed covenant community. This connection would resonate with Jewish followers and indicate that the Kingdom of God was being established through Jesus' ministry.

3. **Intimate Training and Relationship**: The apostles were chosen to be in close relationship with Jesus, allowing them to receive direct teaching, witness His miracles, and learn from His example. This intimate association prepared them for their future roles as leaders in the early Church (Mark 3:14).

4. **Empowerment for Ministry**: Jesus not only called the apostles to be His followers but also empowered them for ministry. He sent them out to preach, heal, and cast out demons (Matthew 10:1), giving them authority to carry on His work after His resurrection and ascension. 

5. **Diversity of Backgrounds**: The apostles came from various backgrounds, including fishermen, a tax collector, and others, illustrating the inclusivity of Jesus' message. This diverse group was meant to reach a broader audience and demonstrate that the Gospel is for all people, regardless of their past.

6. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**: The selection of the apostles also fulfilled Old Testament prophecies about God's plan for His people and the coming of a Messiah who would establish a new covenant (Isaiah 43:1-7).

In summary, Jesus chose the twelve apostles to fulfill divine purpose, symbolize the new Israel, train and empower them for ministry, exemplify diversity in leadership, and fulfill scriptural prophecy. Their selection underscores the foundational role they would have in the growth and spread of Christianity.

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that delves into various theological aspects of why the twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus. They effectively highlighted key reasons such as divine selection, representation of Israel, intimate training and relationship, empowerment for ministry, diversity of backgrounds, and fulfillment of prophecy. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on directly addressing the concern of the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, rather than delving into additional details. The reference answer is more concise and directly addresses the core reason for the selection of the apostles.
