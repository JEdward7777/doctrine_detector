  "grade_comment": "I'm happy to grade this response for you!\n\n**Grade: 85**\n\nThis response receives high marks for its comprehensive coverage of the significance of the twelve apostles in the New Testament. The writer provides a clear explanation of why Jesus chose the twelve, citing theological and practical reasons, including divine selection, representation of Israel, intimate training and relationship, empowerment for ministry, diversity of backgrounds, and fulfillment of prophecy.\n\nThe response also shows a good understanding of the role and significance of the apostles in establishing the early Church and spreading Christianity. The writer effectively connects the apostles' selection to Jesus' plan for salvation and the establishment of the Kingdom of God.\n\nOne area for improvement is that the response could be more concise and focused on the main points. Some of the supporting details, while interesting, slightly dilute the central message. Additionally, a few sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the apostles' significance in the New Testament and effectively communicates their importance to the growth and spread of Christianity."
