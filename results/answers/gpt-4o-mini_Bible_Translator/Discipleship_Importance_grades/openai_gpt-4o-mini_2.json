The detailed explanation of divine selection, representation of Israel, intimate training, empowerment for ministry, diversity of backgrounds, and fulfillment of prophecy effectively demonstrates a deep understanding of the apostles' role in establishing the early Church. The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a comprehensive overview of the apostles' significance beyond just spreading Jesus' teachings. Great job!"
