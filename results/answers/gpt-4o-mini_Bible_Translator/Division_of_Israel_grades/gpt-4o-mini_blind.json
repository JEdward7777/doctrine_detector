  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the major event that occurred in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign, which was the division of the united monarchy into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The response demonstrates an understanding of the political and religious implications of this division. However, to further enhance the grade, the answer could have delved deeper into the spiritual and moral reasons behind the split, particularly emphasizing the disobedience to God's laws and the consequences outlined in scripture."
