## [Answer](../Division_of_Israel.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
After King Solomon's reign, a significant event in Israel's history was the division of the united monarchy. Following Solomon's death around 931 BC, the kingdom was split into two separate kingdoms: the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. This division occurred due to political tensions and dissatisfaction among the tribes of Israel, particularly concerning heavy taxation and forced labor policies instituted by Solomon. The northern kingdom of Israel became ruled by Jeroboam, while Rehoboam, Solomon's son, became king of Judah. This division led to differing religious practices and eventual conflict between the two kingdoms, significantly affecting Israel's history and its relationship with surrounding nations.
