It recognizes the key historical event and the political tensions that led to the division. The response could be improved by including more details on the spiritual significance of the division and how it impacted Israel's relationship with God and its religious practices. A deeper analysis from a Christian worldview on how this division impacted the spiritual journey and obedience of the Israelites would have enhanced the response."
