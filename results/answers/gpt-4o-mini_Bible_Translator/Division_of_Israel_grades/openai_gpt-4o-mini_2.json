It addresses the concern by acknowledging the historical significance of the division and its impact on Israel's history and relationship with surrounding nations. However, it could have further emphasized the spiritual significance of this division in terms of how it relates to God's plans and the consequences of straying from His commandments, which would have enhanced the Christian worldview perspective."
