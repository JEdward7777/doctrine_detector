## [Answer](../Dominion_in_Creation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that humanity has a special role in creation, particularly regarding stewardship and dominion over the earth. This concept is primarily derived from Genesis 1:26-28, where God creates mankind in His image and gives them the responsibility to rule over the earth:

1. **Creation in God's Image**: Genesis 1:26 states, "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." Here, being made in the image of God indicates a unique position and responsibility.

2. **Dominion and Stewardship**: In the verses that follow, especially Genesis 1:28, God blesses humanity and commands them to be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth, and to have dominion over all living things. This dominion implies a role of stewardship rather than exploitation; humans are to govern creation responsibly, mirroring God's authority and care.

3. **Responsibility and Care**: Throughout the Bible, especially in passages like Psalm 24:1 ("The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it"), it is emphasized that while humanity has dominion, the earth ultimately belongs to God. Thus, humanity's role includes caring for and protecting the environment and all living creatures, acting as caretakers of God's creation.

4. **Environmental Ethics**: Other biblical passages, such as Leviticus 25, introduce principles of rest and sustainability, indicating that the land should not be exploited but cared for. This further reflects a call to stewardship that looks out for the well-being of creation.

5. **New Testament Perspective**: In the New Testament, while the focus shifts primarily to spiritual concerns and the Kingdom of God, the idea of living in harmony with creation remains important. Jesusâ€™ teachings about love, care, and responsibility extend to how humanity interacts with the environment and one another.

In summary, the Bible presents humanity's role in having dominion over the earth as one of stewardship, responsible management, and care, reflecting God's character and ensuring the flourishing of all creation. This responsibility involves ethical considerations surrounding environmental care, emphasizing that humans should act as caretakers rather than exploiters of the earth.
