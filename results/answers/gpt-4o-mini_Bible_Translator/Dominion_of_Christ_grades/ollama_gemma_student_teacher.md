## [Answer](../Dominion_of_Christ.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Jesus Christ's dominion is described in several ways throughout the Bible, emphasizing His authority, power, and kingship over all creation. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Authority Over All Creation**: In Matthew 28:18, Jesus declares, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me," indicating that His dominion encompasses not only the spiritual realm but also the physical world.

2. **Eternal Reign**: In Revelation 11:15, it is proclaimed, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever." This suggests that Jesus' dominion is everlasting and encompasses the ultimate sovereignty of God.

3. **King of Kings and Lord of Lords**: Revelation 19:16 refers to Jesus as "King of kings and Lord of lords," highlighting His supreme authority over all earthly rulers and powers. This title indicates that His dominion transcends any human authority.

4. **Spiritual Kingdom**: In John 18:36, Jesus states, "My kingdom is not of this world," indicating that His reign includes a spiritual dimension that transforms lives and hearts, as well as a future physical kingdom.

5. **Messianic Prophecies**: In Isaiah 9:6-7, a prophecy about the coming Messiah describes Him as one who will establish a kingdom of peace and justice, emphasizing His role as the ruler who will govern with righteousness.

6. **Fulfillment of God's Plan**: In Ephesians 1:20-22, Paul writes that God raised Christ from the dead and "seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion," underscoring Jesus' supreme position in God's plan.

7. **Submission of All Creation**: Philippians 2:9-11 states that God has highly exalted Jesus and given Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, indicating that ultimately, all creation will recognize His authority.

These verses illustrate that Jesus Christ's dominion is comprehensive, including both His current spiritual reign and His future physical reign as King, characterized by peace, justice, and righteousness.
