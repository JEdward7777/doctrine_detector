## [Answer](../Duration_of_the_Last_Days.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible does not specify a precise duration for "the last days." The term is used in various contexts throughout Scripture, often indicating a period of time leading up to the return of Christ and the fulfillment of God's final plans. For instance, in Acts 2:17, Peter quotes the prophet Joel, stating that in the last days, God will pour out His Spirit. Similarly, Hebrews 1:2 refers to God speaking to us "in these last days."

The New Testament also contains other references to "the last days," notably in 1 Timothy 4:1 and 2 Timothy 3:1, where Paul describes the characteristics and challenges of this period. However, the exact timing and duration remain unspecified. Jesus Himself, in Matthew 24:36, emphasizes that no one knows the day or hour of His return, not even the angels in heaven, but only the Father.

In summary, while the Bible discusses the nature and significance of the last days, it does not provide a defined timeframe for how long they will last. This lack of specificity encourages believers to remain vigilant and faithful, living in readiness for Christ's return.
