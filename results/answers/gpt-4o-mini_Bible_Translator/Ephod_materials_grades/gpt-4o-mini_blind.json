  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod, as described in the Old Testament. The student effectively identifies the specific materials - gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and fine linen - and explains their roles in the ephod's construction. The final statement on the significance of the ephod in relation to the high priest's role is also well stated. Great job!"
