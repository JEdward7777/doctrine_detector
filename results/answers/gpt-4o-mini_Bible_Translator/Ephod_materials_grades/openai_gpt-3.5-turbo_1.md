The high priest's ephod, as described in the Old Testament, particularly in Exodus 28, was made from several specific materials. It was constructed from fine linen and included the following elements:

1. **Gold:** The ephod was adorned with gold, which was used to create the shoulder pieces and other decorative elements.
2. **Blue, Purple, and Scarlet Yarn:** These colors were used to weave the ephod, adding to its richness and significance.
3. **Fine Linen:** The base of the ephod was made from finely twisted linen, providing both quality and a visual representation of purity.

The ephod was a significant part of the high priest's garments, symbolizing his role in mediating between God and the people of Israel.

Comment: The response provides a detailed description of the materials used in the high priest's ephod, aligning well with the concern that knowing these specifics emphasizes the design and symbolism of the ephod in worship. The inclusion of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, along with fine linen, demonstrates an understanding of the ephod's symbolic significance and its role in the priestly duties. However, it could have been improved by referencing the biblical passage for further validation.
