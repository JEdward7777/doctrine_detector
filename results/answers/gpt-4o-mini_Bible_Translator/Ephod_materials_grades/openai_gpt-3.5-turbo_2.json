It successfully addresses the concern by emphasizing how the specific materials contribute to the design and symbolism of the ephod in the context of worship. Additionally, it highlights the significance of the ephod in the high priest's role as a mediator between God and the people of Israel. Great job in connecting the materials to the broader concept of worship and symbolism in the Christian faith."
