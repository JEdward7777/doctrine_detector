The high priest's ephod, as described in the Old Testament, particularly in Exodus 28, was made from several specific materials. It was constructed from fine linen and included the following elements:

1. **Gold:** The ephod was adorned with gold, which was used to create the shoulder pieces and other decorative elements.
2. **Blue, Purple, and Scarlet Yarn:** These colors were used to weave the ephod, adding to its richness and significance.
3. **Fine Linen:** The base of the ephod was made from finely twisted linen, providing both quality and a visual representation of purity.
