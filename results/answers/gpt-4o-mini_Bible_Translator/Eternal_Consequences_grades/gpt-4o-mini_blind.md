## [Answer](../Eternal_Consequences.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, the term "perishing" often refers to those who are in a state of separation from God due to sin and unbelief. The Bible frequently contrasts eternal life with perishing, indicating that those who reject God's grace and salvation through Jesus Christ face dire consequences.

Key eternal consequences for those described as perishing include:

1. **Separation from God**: One of the primary consequences is eternal separation from God, who is the source of life, goodness, and love. This separation is often described as spiritual death (Revelation 20:14, Matthew 25:41).

2. **Eternal Punishment**: Many scriptures suggest that those who perish experience eternal punishment or condemnation. For example, in Matthew 25:46, Jesus speaks of "these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life." This indicates a conscious existence apart from God, characterized by suffering.

3. **Loss of Eternal Life**: The New Testament emphasizes that eternal life is a gift from God, granted through faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:16, Romans 6:23). Those who perish do not receive this gift and, therefore, lack the hope and promise of everlasting life with God.

4. **Under God's Wrath**: John 3:36 states, "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them." This indicates that those who perish live under the consequence of God’s wrath due to their rejection of Christ.

In summary, the eternal consequences for those who are perishing according to Christian theology involve separation from God, potential eternal punishment, loss of eternal life, and living under God's wrath. The overarching theme in Christian teaching is the call to repent and accept God's offer of salvation through Jesus Christ to avoid these consequences.
