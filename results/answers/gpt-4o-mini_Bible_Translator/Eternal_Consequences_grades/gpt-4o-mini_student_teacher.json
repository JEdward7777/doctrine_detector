  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a solid understanding of the eternal consequences for those who are described as 'perishing' by providing detailed explanations supported by relevant Bible verses. They effectively conveyed the seriousness of eternal separation from God and highlighted key aspects such as separation from God, eternal punishment, loss of eternal life, and living under God's wrath. The student's response aligns well with the Christian worldview and effectively communicates the gravity of the issue at hand."
