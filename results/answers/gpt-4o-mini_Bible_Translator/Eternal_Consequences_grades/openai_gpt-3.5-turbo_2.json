  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the eternal consequences for those who are perishing based on Christian theology. It effectively addresses the concern of understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God by outlining key points such as separation from God, eternal punishment, loss of eternal life, and living under God's wrath. The explanation is clear, well-supported by relevant biblical references, and aligns well with Christian beliefs on the topic."
