It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting key aspects such as separation from God, eternal punishment in hell, loss of eternal life, and living under God's wrath. The incorporation of relevant scripture references strengthens the argument and demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on this important theological concept."
