The points are well-supported with relevant scripture references and doctrinal explanations. The only minor suggestion for improvement could be to further elaborate on the uniqueness of the Son of God as the second person of the Trinity in the context of eternal relationship with the Father. Overall, this answer demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian doctrine regarding the Son of God."
