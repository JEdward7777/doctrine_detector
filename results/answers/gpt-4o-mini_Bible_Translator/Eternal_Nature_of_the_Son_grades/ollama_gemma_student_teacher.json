  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 90/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that effectively addresses the concern of emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God. The student clearly articulates the key differences between the Son of God and human sons in terms of their existence, nature, salvation, relationship with the Father, authority, and sovereignty. The inclusion of reference to Jesus' role in creation adds further depth to the analysis."
