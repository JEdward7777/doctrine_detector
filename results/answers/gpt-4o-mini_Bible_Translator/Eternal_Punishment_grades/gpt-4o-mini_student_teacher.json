  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively explores how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice within Christian theology. The response addresses key points related to sin, free will, divine justice, the holiness of God, scriptural basis, and the rejection of grace. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern raised about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. Additionally, while the student's answer is thorough, it could have incorporated more direct references to the specific concern raised in the question. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic but could have further aligned the response with the provided concern for a higher grade."
