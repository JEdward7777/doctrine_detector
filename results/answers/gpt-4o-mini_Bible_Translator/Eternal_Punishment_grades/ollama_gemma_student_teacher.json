  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of eternal punishment in hell from a Christian perspective. It addresses the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. The student provides several well-reasoned and scripturally supported arguments to support the claim that the concept of eternal punishment is consistent with God's justice as presented in Christian theology. The response is well-written and demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological issues involved."
