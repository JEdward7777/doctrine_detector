It effectively highlighted how eternal punishment aligns with God's justice in response to rebellion and rejection of salvation through Jesus Christ. The concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences was adequately addressed, showcasing a well-rounded understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
