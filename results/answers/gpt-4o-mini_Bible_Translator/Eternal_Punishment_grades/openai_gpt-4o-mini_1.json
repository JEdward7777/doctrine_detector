The points raised regarding the nature of sin, free will, divine justice, holiness of God, scriptural basis, and rejection of grace effectively address the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences from a Christian worldview. The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theological underpinnings supporting the concept of eternal punishment in hell."
