  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of the encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch in the early church context. The student effectively highlights key implications such as the expansion of the Gospel, inclusion and equality, personal conversion and baptism, the role of the Holy Spirit, and evangelism and discipleship. The doctrinal correctness is well-maintained, and the explanations are clear and supported with relevant scriptural references. Great job overall!"
