## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Matthew 19:12, Jesus refers to eunuchs in a broader context of His teachings on marriage, divorce, and celibacy. The verse states: “For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”

In this passage, Jesus addresses three different categories of eunuchs:

1. **Eunuchs who were born that way**: This may refer to individuals who are physically unable to marry or those who may have a disposition that makes them uninterested in sexual relationships.

2. **Eunuchs made by others**: This likely refers to those who have been castrated or otherwise incapacitated for the purposes of serving in certain roles, often within royal households.

3. **Eunuchs who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven**: Here, Jesus introduces the concept of voluntary celibacy—choosing to remain unmarried and refrain from sexual relationships in order to devote oneself more fully to God's service.

The relationship between this teaching and the concept of celibacy lies in the idea of intentionality in choosing a life of restraint for spiritual purposes. In this context, celibacy is viewed as a legitimate and commendable choice for those who feel called to serve God in that capacity, allowing them to focus entirely on their spiritual life without the distractions that often accompany marital and familial responsibilities.

It's important to note that Jesus' words acknowledge that not everyone is called to celibacy, which reflects a broader theological understanding that both marriage and celibacy can be valid vocations in the Christian life. Ultimately, the key message is that one's commitment to God can manifest in different forms, whether through marriage or through a life of celibacy for the sake of his kingdom.
