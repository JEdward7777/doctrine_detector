  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the different categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 19:12 and effectively linked them to the concept of celibacy. The response demonstrated a clear understanding of the scriptural passage and its implications for celibacy within a Christian worldview. However, to improve the grade, the student could have incorporated more direct references to the teacher's answer for alignment and succinctness. Overall, a strong effort in addressing the concern with a Christian perspective."
