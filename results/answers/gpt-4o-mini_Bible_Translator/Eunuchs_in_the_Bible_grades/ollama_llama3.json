The explanation also acknowledges that not everyone is called to celibacy, reflecting a broader theological understanding of both marriage and celibacy as valid vocations in the Christian life.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are minor, such as the lack of explicit citation or reference to specific biblical passages (although Matthew 19:12 is correctly cited). Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for greater clarity. Overall, however, the response provides a clear and concise understanding of Jesus' teaching on eunuchs and celibacy, effectively addressing the concern about understanding the biblical perspective on this topic."
