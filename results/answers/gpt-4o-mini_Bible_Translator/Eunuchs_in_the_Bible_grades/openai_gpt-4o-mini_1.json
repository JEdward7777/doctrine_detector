  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful analysis of Matthew 19:12, discussing the different categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus and linking it to the concept of celibacy for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The explanation demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and the reasons for choosing a life without marriage. The integration of theological reflections and the broader Christian view on marriage and celibacy enriches the response. Great job overall!"
