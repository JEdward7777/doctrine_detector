  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the biblical perspective on celibacy as presented in Matthew 19:12, addressing the different reasons for living a celibate life in line with the concern. It correctly identifies the three categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus and delves into the nuanced understanding of celibacy in Christian teachings. The inclusion of the concept of intentionality and the acknowledgment that celibacy is not for everyone demonstrates a sound grasp of the theological implications. Overall, this response effectively connects the biblical passage with the broader theme of celibacy in Christianity."
