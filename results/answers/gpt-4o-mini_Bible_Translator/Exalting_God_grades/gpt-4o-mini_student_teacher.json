  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: \nThe student has provided a comprehensive and detailed response on how to exalt God in daily life by incorporating various aspects such as worship, living out faith, gratitude, service to others, making God-centered decisions, studying Scripture, sharing the Gospel, cultivating a Christ-like character, and maintaining a consistent prayer life. While the student's answer goes beyond the reference answer provided by the teacher and provides valuable insights, it could be improved by emphasizing the central idea of highly praising and honoring God through worship, prayer, and obedience to His will. This greater focus on the core concept would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
