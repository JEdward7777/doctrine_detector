## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Certainly! One of the most well-known parables told by Jesus is the Parable of the Good Samaritan, found in Luke 10:25-37.

### The Parable:
In this parable, Jesus tells the story of a man who was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho and was attacked by robbers, who stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and left him half-dead. A priest and a Levite both passed by the man but did not help him. Finally, a Samaritan, who was traditionally viewed as an outsider and enemy to the Jews, stopped and took pity on the wounded man. He bandaged his wounds, placed him on his own donkey, and took him to an inn where he took care of him. The next day, he gave the innkeeper money and asked him to take care of the man, promising to repay any additional expenses upon his return.

### Significance:
1. **Love for Neighbor**: The parable emphasizes the importance of loving one’s neighbor, regardless of social or ethnic boundaries. The Samaritan’s actions demonstrate that true compassion goes beyond societal prejudices.

2. **Challenge to Religious Norms**: By choosing a Samaritan as the hero of the story, Jesus challenged the prevailing attitudes of the Jewish people, who would typically view Samaritans with disdain. This aspect underscores that righteousness is not measured by social status or religious title, but by the actions of the heart.

3. **Practical Compassion**: The Samaritan didn’t just feel compassion; he took practical steps to help the wounded man. This teaches that genuine faith is expressed through actions that serve others, particularly those in need.

4. **The Nature of True Discipleship**: At the end of the parable, Jesus asks the question, “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?” This drives home the point that true discipleship involves active love and mercy.

5. **Redemptive Love**: The parable reflects God’s own love for humanity, illustrating that He cares for the broken and marginalized. Just as the Good Samaritan acted out of love and mercy, so does God through Jesus extend grace and salvation to all.

Overall, the Parable of the Good Samaritan serves to inform Christians on the nature of love, urging them to act with compassion and kindness towards all, transcending the barriers that society may impose.
