  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive response citing specific examples from the Bible that illustrate instances of demon possession. They also elaborated on these examples, demonstrating an understanding of the spiritual struggle portrayed in these narratives and the authority of Jesus over evil spirits. Additionally, they connected these examples to the broader themes of spiritual warfare, faith, and the transformative power of Jesus' healing and deliverance, aligning well with the concern of understanding the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith. However, the student missed mentioning the examples from Mark 1:32, Matthew 4:24, and Matthew 8:33 as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer, leading to a slight deduction in the grade."
