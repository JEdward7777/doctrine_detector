The examples given are relevant, well-explained, and reflect the authority of Jesus over demonic forces. Additionally, the response effectively connects these Biblical accounts to the importance of faith and the transformative power of Jesus in contemporary faith. Great job in addressing the concern with a Christian worldview perspective.\n"
