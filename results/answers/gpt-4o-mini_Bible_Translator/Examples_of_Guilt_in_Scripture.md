## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of guilt is woven throughout the Bible, often reflecting the moral and spiritual consequences of sin. Here are some notable examples that illustrate this theme:

1. **Adam and Eve (Genesis 3)**: The story of the fall in the Garden of Eden demonstrates the origin of guilt. After disobeying God by eating the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve became aware of their nakedness and felt shame (Genesis 3:7). When God confronts them, they express guilt through their attempts to hide from God and shift blame to one another.

2. **Cain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-16)**: Cain's guilt manifests after he murders his brother Abel out of jealousy. God questions Cain about Abel's whereabouts, and Cain responds evasively. The guilt of his actions leads God to pronounce a curse on Cain, marking him as a wanderer.

3. **David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11-12)**: King David's adultery with Bathsheba and his orchestration of her husband Uriah's death illustrate guilt profoundly. After being confronted by the prophet Nathan, David expresses his guilt in Psalm 51, a heartfelt confession where he pleads for mercy and acknowledges his sin against God.

4. **Peter's Denial of Christ (Matthew 26:69-75)**: After denying knowing Jesus three times, Peter is filled with guilt and remorse. His weeping after realizing Jesus' foretelling of his denial shows a deep sense of regret and conviction for his actions.

5. **The Woman Caught in Adultery (John 8:1-11)**: The Pharisees bring a woman caught in adultery before Jesus, ready to condemn her according to the law. Instead, Jesus challenges those without sin to cast the first stone. The guilt of the accusers leads them to leave one by one, illustrating the theme of guilt and forgiveness in the presence of sin.

6. **Judas Iscariot (Matthew 27:3-5)**: After betraying Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, Judas feels overwhelming guilt when he sees that his actions lead to Jesus' condemnation. He returns the money and hangs himself, demonstrating the devastating effect of unresolved guilt.

These examples highlight various aspects of guilt, including recognition of wrongdoing, consequences of sin, the possibility of repentance, and the significance of divine forgiveness. Each narrative underscores the personal and relational implications of guilt in the context of one's relationship with God and others.
