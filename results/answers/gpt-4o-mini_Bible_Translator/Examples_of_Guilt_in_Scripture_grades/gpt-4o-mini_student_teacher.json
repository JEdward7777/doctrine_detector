  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful response with relevant examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt. The examples chosen effectively illustrate the theme of guilt in relation to justice, innocence, and divine judgment, as specified in the concern. The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of how guilt operates in the context of biblical narratives. However, the reference answer provides an additional example that directly aligns with the concern given, which the student's response lacks. Overall, a well-structured and comprehensive answer."
