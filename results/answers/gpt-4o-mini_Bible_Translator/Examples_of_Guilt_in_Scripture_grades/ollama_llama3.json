  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides six biblical examples that demonstrate the concept of guilt, including its recognition, consequences, repentance, and forgiveness. The examples are well-chosen and provide a good representation of how guilt operates in the context of sin and redemption. The writer also does a good job of highlighting the personal and relational implications of guilt in one's relationship with God and others.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about justice and innocence, which is mentioned in the given answer. While the examples do touch on themes related to justice and innocence (e.g., Pilate declaring Jesus innocent), they are not explicitly discussed in relation to these concepts. Therefore, I deduct a few points for not fully addressing this concern.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written, provides good biblical examples, and demonstrates an understanding of the concept of guilt in the context of sin and redemption. With some more explicit attention to the concern about justice and innocence, the response could be even stronger."
