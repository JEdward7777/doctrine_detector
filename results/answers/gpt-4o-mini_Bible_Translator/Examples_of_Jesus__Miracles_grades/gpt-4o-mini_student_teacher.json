The explanation was thorough and demonstrated a strong grasp of Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' miracles. One minor improvement could be to directly tie the significance of each miracle back to the belief in Jesus as the Son of God in a more explicit manner throughout the answer. Overall, a comprehensive and well-written response."
