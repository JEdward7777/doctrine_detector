  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns with Christian doctrine. The response effectively articulates how true faith in Jesus manifests in a person's life through transformation, obedience, service, worship, evangelism, perseverance, community involvement, love, and assurance in salvation. The student effectively references relevant Bible verses to support each point, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers to live out their faith more explicitly. Overall, an excellent response with a strong doctrinal foundation."
