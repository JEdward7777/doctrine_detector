## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible places a strong emphasis on faithfulness in marriage and explicitly condemns adultery as a violation of the marital covenant. Several passages highlight the importance of fidelity and the serious nature of infidelity:

1. **Exodus 20:14** - One of the Ten Commandments states, "You shall not commit adultery." This command underscores the expectation of loyalty and faithfulness within the marriage relationship.

2. **Matthew 5:27-28** - In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught that not only is the act of adultery sinful, but even lustful thoughts towards another person can be seen as a form of adultery in the heart. This expands the definition of adultery beyond physical acts to include our thoughts and intentions.

3. **Hebrews 13:4** - This passage states, "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral." It emphasizes both the sanctity of marriage and the seriousness of violating that commitment.

4. **1 Corinthians 6:9-10** - The Apostle Paul warns that those who engage in adultery (among other sins) will not inherit the kingdom of God, highlighting the spiritual consequences of such actions.

5. **Malachi 2:14-16** - Here, God expresses His displeasure with unfaithfulness in marriage and emphasizes that He hates divorce, suggesting that faithfulness is a fundamental aspect of His design for marriage.

6. **Ephesians 5:31** - This passage cites Genesis, stating that a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife, indicating the deep bond and commitment inherent in marriage.

Overall, the Bible teaches that marriage is a sacred covenant designed by God, and faithfulness within that covenant is crucial. Adultery is viewed as a serious offense that can bring significant consequences, both relationally and spiritually. Faithfulness is not just an expectation but a reflection of God's faithfulness to His people.
