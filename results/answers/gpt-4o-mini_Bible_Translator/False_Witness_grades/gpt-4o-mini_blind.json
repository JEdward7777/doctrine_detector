  "grade_comment": "Grade: 94\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of what the Bible says about giving false testimony and why it is significant in a Christian context. The student effectively references key passages from both the Old and New Testaments, and offers insightful explanations on the moral, relational, and theological implications of bearing false witness. The answer is well-structured, doctrinally sound, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
