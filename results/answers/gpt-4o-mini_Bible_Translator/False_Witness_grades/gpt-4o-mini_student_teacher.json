  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that effectively highlights the significance of giving false testimony in a Christian context. The response integrates relevant biblical passages and offers thoughtful insights into the moral, relational, and theological implications of truthfulness. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern about how recognizing the seriousness of false testimony encourages truthfulness in words and actions."
