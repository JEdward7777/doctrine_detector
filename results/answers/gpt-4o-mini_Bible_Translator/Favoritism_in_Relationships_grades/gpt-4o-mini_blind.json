  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of favoritism from a Christian perspective and its implications on relationships. The answer effectively connects the concept of favoritism with biblical teachings on equality and impartiality. The student offers clear examples and explanations of how favoritism can erode trust, damage community, perpetuate inequality, and contradict Christian principles. The inclusion of relevant Scriptures enhances the response. However, for a higher grade, the student could delve deeper into the theological implications of favoritism and provide more specific examples or practical steps to combat favoritism in different relational contexts."
