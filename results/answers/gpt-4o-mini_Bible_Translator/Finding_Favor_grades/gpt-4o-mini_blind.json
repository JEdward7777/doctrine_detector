The student effectively integrates key scriptural examples, such as Noah, Mary, Joseph, and Esther, to support their explanation. The reference to Proverbs 3:3-4 in discussing the conditions for favor is particularly insightful. The clarity and depth of the response demonstrate a solid understanding of the concept within a Christian worldview. Great job!"
