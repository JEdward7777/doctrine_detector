The insights drawn from biblical examples and New Testament teachings are well-supported and relevant. The response could be strengthened with more direct references to specific Bible verses to further enhance the scriptural basis of the argument. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of prayer and dependency on God in fulfilling these roles could enrich the Christian worldview perspective."
