The response effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the specific nuances and implications of each term, while also mentioning the broader context of God's sovereignty and human free will within different Christian traditions. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the subject matter and effectively clarifies the relationship between these similar theological concepts from a Christian perspective. Well done!"
