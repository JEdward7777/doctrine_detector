The response integrates relevant Bible verses and theological insights effectively. The suggestions for finding freedom from sin are biblically grounded and highlight the importance of confession, repentance, reliance on God's grace, community, and the work of the Holy Spirit. The student's answer aligns well with the Christian worldview and encourages believers to address sin for a deeper relationship with God. Great job!"
