## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
From a Christian perspective, fulfilling promises or vows made before God is considered very important. The Bible emphasizes the seriousness of making vows and the expectation that they should be honored. For example, in Ecclesiastes 5:4-5, it states, “When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.”

Additionally, Scripture teaches that God views our promises seriously. In Matthew 5:33-37, Jesus reinforces the importance of honesty and integrity in what we say, urging believers to fulfill their commitments. Moreover, James 5:12 encourages believers to let their 'yes' be 'yes' and their 'no' be 'no,' highlighting the calling for integrity in speech and behavior.

Overall, fulfilling promises made before God is seen as an expression of faithfulness and integrity, reflecting one's character and relationship with God. It is not only a matter of keeping one's word but also about living in accordance with the values and principles taught in Scripture. Failing to fulfill a vow could be viewed as a breach of trust, both in the human and divine sense.
