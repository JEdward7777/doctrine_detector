The inclusion of different aspects such as specific events, confirmation of divine authority, typological fulfillment, conditional vs. unconditional prophecies, and cumulative fulfillment demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. The student effectively integrates relevant scriptural references to support their points. This answer aligns well with Christian doctrine regarding prophecy fulfillment. Great job!"
