  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the figurative uses of the word 'soul' in the Bible, connecting it to various aspects of human identity and experience. They effectively explored the implications of the figurative language surrounding 'soul' and how it shapes our understanding of ourselves from a biblical perspective. The response demonstrated a strong grasp of the topic and effectively integrated relevant biblical references to support their points. However, to align more closely with the concern expressed about acknowledging figurative language leading to a deeper understanding of human experience from a biblical perspective, the student could have focused more on the emotional and experiential aspects of the soul in relation to human identity. Overall, this was a well-written and thoughtful response."
