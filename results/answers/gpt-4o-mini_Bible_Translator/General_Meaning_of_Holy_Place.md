## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The term 'holy place' can certainly be understood in a broader context beyond just the tabernacle or temple in several ways:

1. **Sacredness of Creation**: In the biblical narrative, the entire creation is seen as a reflection of God’s holiness (Genesis 1:31). Places where people encounter God's presence, such as mountains (e.g., Mount Sinai), gardens (e.g., Eden), or even natural settings, can be considered 'holy places'.

2. **Believers as Temples**: The New Testament expands the concept of holiness to include believers themselves. In 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, Paul teaches that the body of a believer is a temple of the Holy Spirit. This implies that wherever a believer goes, they carry the presence of God, thus making any place they occupy a 'holy place'.

3. **Community of Faith**: Churches and gatherings of believers can be understood as 'holy places'. Matthew 18:20 states, “For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.” This signifies that communal worship and fellowship can be a context in which the presence of God is experienced.

4. **Personal Encounter with God**: Individuals may create 'holy places' in their own lives through personal prayer, meditation, and worship. These could be simple spaces in homes, such as prayer corners or reading areas, where one feels a deep connection with God.

5. **Covenant and Presence**: Throughout the Bible, 'holy places' are where God manifests His presence as part of the covenant relationship with His people. This can extend to events in everyday life where one experiences divine guidance, support, or revelation.

6. **Historical Sites**: Places where significant biblical events occurred, such as locations from Jesus' ministry, can also be seen as 'holy' due to their connection to God's work throughout history.

7. **Spiritual Disciplines**: Engaging in spiritual disciplines in any context, such as fasting, prayer, or worship, can transform that space or time into a 'holy place' as it becomes a setting for encountering God's holiness.

In summary, while 'holy place' has specific historical and theological meanings within the context of the tabernacle and temple, it can also be broadened to encompass a variety of physical, communal, and personal spaces where God’s presence and holiness are acknowledged and experienced in the lives of believers.
