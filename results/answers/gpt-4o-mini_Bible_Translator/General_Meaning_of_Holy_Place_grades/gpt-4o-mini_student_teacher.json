  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of 'holy place' in a broader context beyond the tabernacle or temple. They effectively incorporated various biblical references and examples to support their points. However, the answer could have been improved by more explicitly connecting each point to the concern of identifying places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
