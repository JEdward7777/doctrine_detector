  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response on ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily lives, integrating various Christian theological principles and references. The student effectively addressed the concern of emphasizing the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness. However, the teacher's reference answer focused more on sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments. While the student covered a broader range of ways to glorify God, the core emphasis of sharing personal testimonies seemed to be missing. This slight deviation from the reference answer warrants a slightly lower grade but overall, the student demonstrated a deep understanding of Christian principles and provided meaningful insights."
