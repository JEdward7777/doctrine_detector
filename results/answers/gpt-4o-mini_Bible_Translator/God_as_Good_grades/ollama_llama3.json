  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response accurately reflects the biblical statement about God's goodness, emphasizing that true goodness originates from God alone. It also highlights the significance of Jesus' statement in Mark 10:18, Matthew 19:17, and Luke 18:19, explaining how it underscores the perfect nature of God and invites reflection on the nature of goodness.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern about recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs, demonstrating a clear understanding that human efforts to be good or righteous are inherently flawed compared to God's standard. The discussion of Jesus' identity and his relationship with the Father also adds depth to the analysis.\n\nOne area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the implications of Jesus' statement for Christian ethics and morality, exploring how this understanding of God's goodness should shape our daily lives and decisions. However, overall, this response provides a thoughtful and biblical exploration of Jesus' teaching on God's goodness."
