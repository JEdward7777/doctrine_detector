## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
When Jesus states, "There is only one who is good, and that is God," found in Mark 10:18 (and also in Matthew 19:17 and Luke 18:19), he is addressing a rich young ruler who has called him "Good Teacher." By responding in this manner, Jesus emphasizes the supreme goodness of God and distinguishes the divine nature of God from that of any human being.

This statement serves several purposes:

1. **Affirmation of God's Unique Goodness**: Jesus underscores that true goodness originates from God alone. In a theological context, this highlights the perfect nature of God, who embodies moral perfection.

2. **Inviting Reflection**: Jesus invites the young ruler to reflect on the nature of goodness and his understanding of what it means to be "good." It challenges the man (and the audience) to consider whether they truly understand the implications of calling someone "good" in the ultimate sense.

3. **Revealing Christ’s Identity**: In a subtler way, this teaching hints at the divinity of Christ. Jesus, by his life and ministry, reveals God's character, and this statement positions him in relation to God's goodness—suggesting that he shares in that divine goodness given his unique relationship with the Father.

4. **Encouraging Humility**: It reminds us that human efforts to be good or righteous are inherently flawed compared to God’s standard. This underscores the Christian belief in the need for divine grace rather than self-reliance in achieving goodness or righteousness.

In essence, Jesus is directing attention to God as the ultimate source of goodness, encouraging an understanding that aligns with the biblical perspective of human morality being measured by God’s character.
