  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student gave a thorough and detailed answer citing relevant Bible verses that highlight God's compassion. They effectively connected how God's compassion influences our understanding of divine love and mercy. However, they could have directly referenced the teacher's answer that succinctly stated the Bible's view on God's nature in relation to compassion, and the student's explanation could have been slightly more concise."
