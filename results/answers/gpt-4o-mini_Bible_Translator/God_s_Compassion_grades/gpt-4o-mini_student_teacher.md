The Bible portrays God's nature as inherently compassionate and merciful. Several passages illustrate this attribute:

1. **Exodus 34:6-7**: When God reveals Himself to Moses, He describes His nature as "abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin." This emphasizes Godâ€™s desire to show compassion and forgiveness.

2. **Psalm 103:8-13**: This psalm beautifully expresses God's compassion: "The LORD is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love... As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him."

3. **Isaiah 30:18**: This verse highlights God's longing to be gracious: "Therefore the Lord waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you."

4. **Lamentations 3:22-23**: This passage highlights God's compassion in a time of suffering: "The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness."

5. **Matthew 9:36**: In the New Testament, Jesus embodies God's compassion, as seen when He looks at the crowds and has compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

6. **1 Peter 5:7**: This verse encourages believers to cast their anxieties on God because He cares for them, underscoring the nature of God as a compassionate presence in times of distress.

Overall, the Bible consistently affirms that compassion is a central aspect of God's character, revealing His love and care for humanity.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student gave a thorough and detailed answer citing relevant Bible verses that highlight God's compassion. They effectively connected how God's compassion influences our understanding of divine love and mercy. However, they could have directly referenced the teacher's answer that succinctly stated the Bible's view on God's nature in relation to compassion, and the student's explanation could have been slightly more concise.
