The Bible portrays God's nature as inherently compassionate and merciful. Several passages illustrate this attribute:

1. **Exodus 34:6-7**: When God reveals Himself to Moses, He describes His nature as "abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin." This emphasizes Godâ€™s desire to show compassion and forgiveness.

2. **Psalm 103:8-13**: This psalm beautifully expresses God's compassion: "The LORD is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love... As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him."

3. **Isaiah 30:18**: This verse highlights God's longing to be gracious: "Therefore the Lord waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you."

4. **Lamentations 3:22-23**: This passage highlights God's compassion in a time of suffering: "The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness."

5. **Matthew 9:36**: In the New Testament, Jesus embodies God's compassion, as seen when He looks at the crowds and has compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

6. **1 Peter 5:7**: This verse encourages believers to cast their anxieties on God because He cares for them, underscoring the nature of God as a compassionate presence in times of distress.

Overall, the Bible consistently affirms that compassion is a central aspect of God's character, revealing His love and care for humanity.
