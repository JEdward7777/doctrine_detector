## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
When the Bible describes God as "jealous," it's important to understand the context and meaning of jealousy as it pertains to God's nature. The term "jealous" in Scripture often refers to God's passionate desire for His people and His relationship with them. 

In a biblical context, particularly in verses like Exodus 20:5 and Deuteronomy 5:9, Godâ€™s jealousy is depicted in relation to idolatry. God desires exclusive devotion from His people and is protective of the covenant relationship He has established with them. His jealousy is not the selfish, resentful jealousy often experienced between humans, but rather a righteous zeal for His honor and a desire for the well-being of His people.

This concept emphasizes that God is deeply invested in the faithfulness of His people. It illustrates His commitment to them and His desire to maintain a close, loving relationship. When people turn to idols or other allegiances, God's jealousy signifies His longing for their return to Him and the consequences of straying from that relationship.

Overall, God's jealousy reflects His holiness, His love, and His commitment, contrasting with human jealousy that often stems from insecurity or fear of loss. In this way, the Biblical portrayal of God's jealousy can be understood as a demonstration of His profound love and desire for a covenant relationship with humanity.
