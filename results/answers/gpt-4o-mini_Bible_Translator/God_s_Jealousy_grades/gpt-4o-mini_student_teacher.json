  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 90. The student provides a well-explained understanding of God's jealousy in relation to idolatry and the covenant relationship with His people. They accurately describe God's jealousy as a reflection of His holiness, love, and commitment to humanity. The only improvement could be more direct alignment with the reference answer in terms of emphasizing God's longing for purity and reverence from His people. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid grasp of the concept and provides insightful interpretations."
