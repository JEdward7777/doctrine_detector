  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of God's jealousy within a biblical context, emphasizing the importance of understanding His character and His desire for spiritual fidelity. The student effectively integrates scriptural references and theological insights to support their explanation. The only area for improvement could be further elaboration on how God's jealousy aligns with His love and holiness, but overall, the response reflects a solid understanding of the concept in a Christian worldview."
