## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, justification is the act by which God declares a sinner to be righteous on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ. It is a central tenet of Christian faith, particularly emphasized in Pauline theology. Here’s a breakdown of how God justifies sinners and what justification entails:

1. **The Basis of Justification**:
   - Justification is grounded in the sacrificial work of Jesus Christ. According to Romans 3:22-24, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
   - The death and resurrection of Jesus are seen as the atoning sacrifice that satisfies God’s justice and enables Him to forgive sins without compromising His holiness.

2. **Faith as the Means**:
   - Justification is received through faith. Romans 5:1 states, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." This means that it is not by works or adherence to the Law that one is justified, but through trusting in Christ and His finished work.

3. **Imputed Righteousness**:
   - In justification, the righteousness of Christ is imputed, or attributed, to the believer. This means that God considers the believer to be righteous because of their union with Christ, rather than because of their own merit (2 Corinthians 5:21).

4. **Legal Declaration**:
   - Justification is a legal term indicating that God declares the sinner to be righteous. It is a definitive act and does not imply that they are morally perfect. Instead, it signifies a change in status from guilty to not guilty before God.

5. **Immediate and Final**:
   - Justification occurs at the moment of faith and is a completed action. It contrasts with sanctification, which is the ongoing process of being made holy.

6. **Results of Justification**:
   - Justification leads to peace with God, reconciliation, and a new relationship with Him. Believers are no longer under condemnation but have the hope of eternal life (Romans 8:1).

7. **Role of the Holy Spirit**:
   - After justification, the Holy Spirit begins the work of sanctification in the believer’s life, helping them to grow in holiness and live in accordance with God’s will.

In summary, justification entails a gracious act of God declaring sinners righteous based on their faith in Jesus Christ and His atoning work, resulting in a transformative relationship with God and the assurance of eternal life.
