  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a well-written and comprehensive explanation of the doctrine of justification from a Christian perspective. The answer covers the biblical basis, the role of faith, imputed righteousness, the legal aspect of justification, the immediate and final nature of justification, as well as the results and the role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life post-justification. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological concept of justification and presents it in a clear and organized manner. Great job!"
