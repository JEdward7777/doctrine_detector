They highlighted key points such as the covenant relationship, distinction of God, revelation of character, worship and holiness, theological implications, and eschatological significance. The answer effectively connects the significance of God's name 'Yahweh' with deeper understanding and reverence in worship, aligning well with the specified concern. The student could have further emphasized the foundational meaning of 'Yahweh' as 'he is' or 'I am' to reinforce the eternal existence and unchanging nature of God."
