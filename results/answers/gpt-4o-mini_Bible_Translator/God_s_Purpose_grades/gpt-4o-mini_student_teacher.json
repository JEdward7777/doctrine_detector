  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's response a grade of 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive answer that covers various aspects of discerning God's plan, including prayer, biblical study, reflective silence, community and counsel, recognizing gifts and passions, circumstances, and peace and conviction, they did go into more detail than necessary. The student's response could have been more concise and focused in addressing the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling.\n\nHowever, the student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the practices involved in discerning God's plan, and they integrated relevant Bible verses to support their points. They showed a depth of knowledge and a well-rounded approach to the question."
