These practices align well with a Christian worldview and provide a solid foundation for seeking God's guidance. However, the response could have addressed the concern of believers feeling lost or confused more directly by emphasizing the importance of trusting in God's sovereignty and remaining steadfast in faith even during times of spiritual uncertainty. Overall, a strong and comprehensive answer with room for slight improvement in addressing specific concerns."
