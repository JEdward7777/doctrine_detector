It emphasizes the importance of prayer, studying the Bible, seeking wise counsel, paying attention to circumstances, recognizing personal gifts, and following a sense of peace in decision-making. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses strengthens the response. However, to further address the concern of believers feeling lost or confused, it could have offered additional encouragement and reassurance from a Christian perspective on how God can bring clarity and purpose to individuals seeking His will."
