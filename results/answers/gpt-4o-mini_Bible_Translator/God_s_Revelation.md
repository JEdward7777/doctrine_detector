## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
God introduces Himself through various names and titles throughout the Bible, each reflecting different aspects of His character and His relationship with humanity. Here are a few significant names used in Scripture:

1. **Yahweh (Jehovah)**: Often translated as "LORD" in English Bibles, this name signifies God's eternal existence and faithfulness. It is first revealed to Moses in Exodus 3:14, where God says, "I AM WHO I AM," indicating His self-existence and sovereignty.

2. **Elohim**: This is a plural form of God used in the very first verse of the Bible, Genesis 1:1, "In the beginning, God (Elohim) created the heavens and the earth." It highlights God's power as the Creator and His majesty.

3. **El Shaddai**: Translated as "God Almighty," this name emphasizes God's ultimate power over all. It appears in Genesis 17:1 when God makes a covenant with Abraham.

4. **Adonai**: Meaning "Lord" or "Master," this name is often used in the context of God's authority and lordship over Israel and the world.

5. **Yahweh Jireh**: Translated as "The Lord Will Provide," this name reflects God's provision and care, as seen in Genesis 22:14, where Abraham names the place after God provides a ram in place of Isaac.

6. **Yahweh Rapha**: Meaning "The Lord Who Heals," this name signifies God's ability to heal, as found in Exodus 15:26.

7. **Yahweh Shalom**: Translated as "The Lord Is Peace," this name, found in Judges 6:24, reflects God's ability to provide peace amidst turmoil.

8. **Yahweh Nissi**: Meaning "The Lord Is My Banner," found in Exodus 17:15, this name symbolizes God's guidance and protection in battle.

9. **Father**: In the New Testament, Jesus often refers to God as "Father," emphasizing a personal and familial relationship with Him, which invites believers into a deeper understanding of intimacy with God (e.g., Matthew 6:9, John 14:6-7).

These names and titles all communicate different facets of God's nature, attributes, and His relationship with His people, reinforcing key theological truths in the Christian faith.
