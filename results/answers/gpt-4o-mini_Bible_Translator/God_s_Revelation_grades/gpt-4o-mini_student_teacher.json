  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-researched answer discussing various names and titles of God in the Bible, which indeed reflect different aspects of His character and relationship with humanity. However, the student's response did not directly address the importance of God introducing Himself using His name 'Yahweh' in understanding His character and relationship with His followers, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. While the student's answer adds valuable insights into the significance of different names and titles of God, it lacks focus on the specific concern provided."
