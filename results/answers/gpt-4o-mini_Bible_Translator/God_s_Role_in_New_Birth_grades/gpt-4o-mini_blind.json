  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation of God's role in the process of a person being born again. The student covers key aspects such as initiation of salvation, conviction of sin, regeneration, faith and response, and sustaining grace, with appropriate biblical references. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian theology on this topic. Great job!"
