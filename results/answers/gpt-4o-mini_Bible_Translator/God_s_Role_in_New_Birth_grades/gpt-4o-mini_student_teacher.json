  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer regarding God's role in the process of a person being born again. They correctly highlighted key biblical references and theological concepts related to salvation and emphasized the necessity of God's sovereign work in initiating and accomplishing new birth. However, there is a slight deviation in the emphasis compared to the reference answer, as the student's response expands on various aspects of God's role beyond just divine initiative. Overall, a strong and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
