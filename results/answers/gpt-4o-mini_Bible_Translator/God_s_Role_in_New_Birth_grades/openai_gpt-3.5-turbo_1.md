## [Answer](../God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, the concept of being "born again" refers to a spiritual transformation that occurs when an individual accepts Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. This term is primarily drawn from Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus in John 3:3-7, where He explains that one must be "born again" to see the Kingdom of God.

God's role in this process can be understood in several key ways:

1. **Initiation of Salvation**: Christian doctrine emphasizes that God is the initiator of salvation. In Ephesians 2:8-9, it is stated that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of human effort, which underscores that God takes the first step in reaching out to humanity.

2. **Conviction of Sin**: The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in the process of being born again by convicting individuals of their sinfulness and need for redemption (John 16:8-11). This conviction helps individuals realize their need for salvation and spurs them to respond to God's call.

3. **Regeneration**: The process of being born again involves regeneration, a theological term that denotes being spiritually made alive through the Holy Spirit. According to Titus 3:5, God saves us "through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit." This indicates that the work of the Holy Spirit is essential in transforming a person's heart and mind.

4. **Faith and Response**: While God's role is foundational, individuals must still exercise faith and make a conscious decision to accept that gift of salvation. John 1:12 states, "Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God." This highlights the necessity of personal faith in the process of being born again.

5. **Sustaining Grace**: After an individual is born again, God's continuing role involves sanctification, which is the process of becoming more like Christ over time. Philippians 1:6 assures believers that God will carry on the good work He began in them until the day of Christ Jesus.

In summary, God's role in the process of a person being born again encompasses initiation, conviction, regeneration, the gift of faith, and ongoing transformation, all of which work together in the miracle of spiritual rebirth and the journey of faith.
