While it does not explicitly address the concern about recognizing God's punishment as a \"pouring out of God's wrath,\" it touches on this idea indirectly through descriptions of God's judgment and wrath in various passages.\n\nThe response could be strengthened by more directly addressing the concern and exploring the implications of God's punishment for those who do not believe. Nevertheless, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the complex themes surrounding the \"Day of Yahweh\" in the biblical narrative."
