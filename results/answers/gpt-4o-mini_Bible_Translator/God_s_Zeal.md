## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "zeal of the Lord" reflects God’s passionate commitment and fervent desire to act on behalf of His people. It signifies an intense, energetic devotion to fulfilling His promises and plans. This phrase is often associated with God's determination to protect, bless, and redeem His people, showcasing both His love and His desire for a relationship with them.

One of the key biblical passages that includes this phrase is Isaiah 9:7, where it states, "Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this." Here, it signifies that God’s fervent desire will actively bring about the establishment of His kingdom and the fulfillment of His covenant promises.

God's zeal can also be seen in His discipline and correction of His people—actions that stem from a deep love and commitment to their ultimate well-being. This underscores the dual aspects of God's zeal: it is both a protective passion that upholds justice and a relentless pursuit of reconciliation with His people, highlighting His unwavering commitment to their spiritual and relational restoration.

In summary, the "zeal of the Lord" powerfully encapsulates God's proactive engagement in the world, emphasizing His passionate love and unwavering commitment to seeing His purposes fulfilled for the good of His people.
