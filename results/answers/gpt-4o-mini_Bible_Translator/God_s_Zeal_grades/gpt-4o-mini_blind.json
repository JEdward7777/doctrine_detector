  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the term \"zeal of the Lord\" in reflecting God's actions towards His people. The student effectively connects the concept of zeal with God's passionate commitment, fervent desire, and active involvement in fulfilling His promises. Scriptural references are included to support the explanation, and the dual aspects of God's zeal in both protection and discipline are well articulated. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound answer."
