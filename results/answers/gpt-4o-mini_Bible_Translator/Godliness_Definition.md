## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible defines "godliness" as a quality that reflects a devoted, pious life aligned with God's will and characterized by reverence, respect, and obedience to Him. It involves a deep relationship with God that manifests in one's thoughts, behaviors, and attitudes.

Key passages that address godliness include:

1. **1 Timothy 4:7-8**: "Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come." This highlights the importance of actively pursuing a godly life through spiritual discipline and focus.

2. **2 Peter 1:3-7**: This passage describes godliness as one of the virtues that believers should develop in their faith. It indicates that through knowing God and His glory, believers are called to add godliness to their faith, showing that it is a response to God's work in their lives.

3. **Titus 2:11-12**: Here, Paul writes, "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age." This underscores that godliness involves a rejection of ungodliness and a choice to live uprightly in accordance with God's standards.

4. **1 Timothy 6:11-12**: Paul advises Timothy to pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness, indicating that godliness encompasses various aspects of a Christian's character and is part of the life of faith.

In summary, godliness in the biblical context is rooted in a relationship with God, demonstrated through a life committed to His teachings, characterized by moral uprightness, dedication to spiritual growth, and a desire to reflect Godâ€™s nature in daily life. It's seen both as a goal to strive for and a quality that results from a true faith in Jesus Christ.
