  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a thorough explanation of godliness, referencing key passages and detailing its significance in daily Christian living, it slightly deviates from the reference answer in terms of focus and simplicity. The reference answer succinctly defines godliness as acting in a way that pleases God, obeying Him, and living righteously, which could be seen as a more direct and concise definition. However, the student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding and engagement with the concept of godliness, drawing from a variety of biblical passages to support their explanation. Overall, the student's answer is comprehensive and well-supported, but could benefit from a bit more alignment with the simplicity of the reference answer."
