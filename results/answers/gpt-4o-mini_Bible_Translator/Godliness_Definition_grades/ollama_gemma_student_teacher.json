  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical definition of \"godliness\" and effectively articulates its key characteristics. They provide relevant scriptural references to support their claims and clearly explain how godliness involves both outward actions and inward character development. The response also acknowledges the dynamic nature of godliness as something that develops over time through a true faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nWhile the answer aligns well with the provided reference answer, it could benefit from further elaboration on how the concept of godliness translates into concrete actions and daily life. Additionally, including a broader range of scripture references would strengthen the overall argument."
