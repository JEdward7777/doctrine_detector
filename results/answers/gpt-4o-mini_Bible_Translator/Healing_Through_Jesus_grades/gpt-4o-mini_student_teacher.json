  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing various aspects of how Jesus approached the healing of demon-possessed individuals, including His authority, compassion, personal interactions, and teaching moments. The answer aligns well with the concern by recognizing the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. However, the student's response could have more explicitly emphasized the central practice of commanding demons to come out, as highlighted in the reference answer."
