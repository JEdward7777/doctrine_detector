  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and detailed explanation of the practice of anointing related to healing in the New Testament, referencing specific verses and highlighting the connection between physical and spiritual healing. The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the role of anointing in Christian practice. However, they could have further emphasized the spiritual significance of anointing as a symbol of requesting God's intervention, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
