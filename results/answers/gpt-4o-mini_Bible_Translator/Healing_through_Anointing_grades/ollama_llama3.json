  "grade_comment": "I'd grade this response a 95.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice. The writer provides clear biblical examples from James, Mark, Luke, and explores the symbolism of oil in relation to the Holy Spirit. The response also effectively highlights how anointing was not just a physical treatment but a profound ritual that recognized and invited God's healing presence.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more concise and focused on the main point. At times, it feels like the writer is providing additional information that while interesting, doesn't directly address the concern of recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing. However, overall, this is a strong response that effectively answers the concern and provides relevant biblical support.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical context and significance of anointing in Christian practice. To take it to the next level, consider condensing your points and focusing more directly on the main question."
