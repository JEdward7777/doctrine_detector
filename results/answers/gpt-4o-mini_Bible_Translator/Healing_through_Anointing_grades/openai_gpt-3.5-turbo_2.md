## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the practice of anointing is closely related to healing, both physically and spiritually. Anointing with oil is mentioned in several passages, often in the context of prayer and healing.

1. **James 5:14-15**: This passage provides a clear instance of anointing in relation to healing. It instructs the elders of the church to anoint the sick with oil in the name of the Lord. The verse states, “Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up.” Here, anointing is portrayed as a part of a communal response to illness, combined with prayer, indicating a link between physical healing and spiritual intercession.

2. **Mark 6:13**: In this passage, the twelve disciples, when sent out by Jesus, anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. This shows that anointing was a practice performed by the early followers of Jesus as they sought to carry on His ministry of healing.

3. **Luke 7:46**: Although here the focus is on the act of anointing in a ceremonial sense, Jesus uses it to indicate significance in a relationship context. When He speaks of the woman who anointed His feet, He refers to the act as one of love and devotion, highlighting how anointing serves as both a physical act and a spiritual expression.

4. **Symbolism of Oil**: In biblical tradition, oil often symbolizes the Holy Spirit, and anointing signifies empowerment and healing. This established a theological framework where anointing with oil is associated with consecration and the healing presence of God.

Overall, in the New Testament, the practice of anointing functions not only as a physical treatment for illness but also as a profound ritual that recognizes and invites God's healing presence through faith, prayer, and community support. It reflects the holistic nature of healing—addressing body, mind, and spirit.
