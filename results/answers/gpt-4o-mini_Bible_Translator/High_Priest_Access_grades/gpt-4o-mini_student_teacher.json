  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that not only highlighted the role of the high priest in approaching the Ark of the Covenant but also included information on the Levites, the general people, and the purification process. The answer demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical guidelines and regulations surrounding the Ark. The only slight deviation from the reference answer was the additional details about the Levites and purification, which, while accurate and expanded the context, were not directly mentioned in the original response provided by the teacher. Overall, an excellent response that shows a deep understanding of the topic."
