## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Exodus and later in Leviticus, guidelines are given regarding who could approach the Ark of the Covenant and under what circumstances. The Ark of the Covenant was considered the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites, and as such, strict rules were established to maintain holiness and reverence.

1. **The High Priest**: Only the High Priest was permitted to approach the Ark, and this was to be done once a year on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. On this day, the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies, where the Ark was located, to make atonement for the sins of the people (Leviticus 16:2-34). He would sprinkle the blood of sacrificed animals on the mercy seat, the lid of the Ark.

2. **The Levites**: The Levites had specific roles related to the care and transportation of the Ark. They could handle the Ark when it was being transported, but even they were not allowed to touch it directly. The Ark was carried by poles inserted through rings on its sides (Exodus 25:12-15), and only those designated by God could carry it. Uzzah, for instance, was struck dead for touching the Ark to stabilize it during transport (2 Samuel 6:6-7), showing the seriousness of this prohibition.

3. **The People**: Generally, the ordinary Israelite was not permitted to approach the Ark. Access was highly restricted to preserve its sanctity and the holiness of God's presence.

4. **Purification**: Before any priest could approach the Ark, they had to undergo a purification process, which included ritual washings and offerings. This was to ensure that they were clean in body and spirit (Leviticus 16:3).

In summary, the approach to the Ark of the Covenant was highly regulated, focusing on the roles of the High Priest and the Levites, coupled with specific times (like the Day of Atonement) and strict guidelines regarding purification and reverence. These regulations reflect the holiness of God and the importance of approaching Him with respect and the right heart.
