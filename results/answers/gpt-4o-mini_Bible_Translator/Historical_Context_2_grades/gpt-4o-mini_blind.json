  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of why the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt. The student effectively highlights the biblical context, God's command, the symbolic meaning of unleavened bread, and the significance of remembrance. The explanation is well-supported with references to relevant biblical verses. The response could be further enhanced by delving deeper into the symbolism of leaven in Jewish tradition and its connections to sin and purity. Overall, a solid and detailed answer."
