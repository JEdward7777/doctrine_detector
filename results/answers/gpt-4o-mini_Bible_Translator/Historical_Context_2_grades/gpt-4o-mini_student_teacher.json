  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of why the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt, drawing on biblical references and highlighting the symbolic significance of this practice. However, there is a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer in terms of emphasizing the urgency of fleeing Egypt as part of their deliverance from slavery. The student's response captures the historical events and religious significance but could have emphasized God's specific instruction for a quicker departure as a key factor, aligning more closely with a Christian worldview."
