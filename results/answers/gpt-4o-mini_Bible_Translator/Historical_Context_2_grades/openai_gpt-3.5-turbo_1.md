# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a direct response to God's command and the urgency of their situation. In the context of the Exodus, which is recounted in the book of Exodus in the Old Testament, the Israelites were instructed to prepare for their departure from slavery in Egypt. 

God commanded them to eat unleavened bread as part of the Passover celebration, which commemorated the final plague on Egypt when the firstborn were killed. The instructions included:

1. **Unleavened Bread**: They were to eat bread without yeast because they would not have time to let the dough rise. The urgency of their departure meant they needed to leave quickly. Exodus 12:34 states, "So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders."

2. **Symbolic Meaning**: Unleavened bread also carries symbolic significance. In Jewish tradition, leaven often symbolizes sin or corruption, and eating unleavened bread can represent purity and the haste with which the Israelites had to leave Egypt. In Exodus 12:17, it says, "And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt."

3. **Remembrance**: This act is also part of a larger ritual intended to help the Israelites remember their deliverance from bondage and the faithfulness of God. The Feast of Unleavened Bread, observed annually, serves as a reminder of their quick exodus and God's deliverance.

Thus, the consumption of unleavened bread was both practical and deeply symbolic, reflecting the nature of their escape and establishing a lasting tradition in Israelite worship and remembrance.
