  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a thorough and well-detailed response that effectively highlights key biblical events and passages from Isaiah and Amos that illustrate the concept of 'remnant.' The student provides solid explanations and connections to the theme of God's preservation of a faithful group throughout times of judgment. The integration of scriptural references and the explanation of their significance demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological concept of 'remnant' in a biblical context. Well done!"
