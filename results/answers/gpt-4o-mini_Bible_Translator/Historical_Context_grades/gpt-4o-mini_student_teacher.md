## [Answer](../Historical_Context.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of the "remnant" is a significant theme in the prophetic books of Isaiah and Amos, symbolizing a faithful group of people that God preserves even amid judgment and destruction. Here are some key biblical events and passages that illustrate this concept:

1. **Isaiah's Declaration of the Remnant**:
   - In Isaiah 10:20-22, after the judgment on Israel through the Assyrian invasion, it is stated that a remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God. Despite the devastation, God promises that a small group will remain faithful and return to Him.
   - Isaiah 11:11-16 speaks of God's promise to recover a remnant of His people from various nations, underscoring His commitment to preserve a faithful group who will restore Israel.

2. **The Faithful in Judah**:
   - During the time of King Hezekiah, many in Judah remained faithful to Yahweh despite the moral decline and idolatry surrounding them. This is exemplified in Isaiah 36-39, where Hezekiah seeks God earnestly. In response to the Assyrian threat, God preserves Jerusalem and a faithful remnant within it.

3. **The Call of the Remnant**:
   - In Isaiah 37:31-32, God promises that those who remain in Judah will take root downward and bear fruit upward. This highlights the idea that through the difficult circumstances, God nurtures His remnant for future growth and restoration.

4. **Amos and the Remnant**:
   - In Amos 5:15, Amos calls for the people to "hate evil and love good," signaling that a remnant must live righteously to escape impending judgment. God's grace allows for a preservation of the righteous even amid widespread corruption.
   - Amos 9:8-10 also declares that God will visit judgment upon the sinful kingdom, yet He will not completely destroy the house of Jacob, indicating that there will be a remnant who survives the judgment.

5. **The Exile and Return**:
   - After the Babylonian exile, the return of a remnant of the Jewish people to Jerusalem (as recorded in books like Ezra and Nehemiah) fulfills the prophetic promises of restoration. This event illustrates the continuity of God's covenant faithfulness and the preservation of a faithful remnant to rebuild and restore true worship.

These events and passages from Isaiah and Amos reflect the overarching theme of God's commitment to His people, highlighting that, even in times of judgment, He preserves a faithful remnant to carry His purposes forward. This concept reinforces the hope of restoration and the importance of remaining faithful amidst adversity.
