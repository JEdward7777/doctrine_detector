  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the remnant in the prophetic books of Isaiah and Amos, highlighting key events and passages that illustrate God's preservation of a faithful group even amid judgment. The historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises is clearly addressed and supported with biblical references. The only room for improvement would be to further elaborate on how the remnant's preservation ties into the broader context of God's covenant and plan for His people."
