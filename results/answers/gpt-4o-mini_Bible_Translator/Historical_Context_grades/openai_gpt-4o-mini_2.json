The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises, showcasing how the remnant symbolizes persistence in God's covenant throughout Israel's history. The only slight improvement could be providing more specific biblical references to support the claim of the remnant returning to Canaan post-exile from Isaiah, and referencing the specific mention of God's preservation of the remnant despite judgment in Amos."
