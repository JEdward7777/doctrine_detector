The division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies after his death in 4 BCE significantly impacted the Jewish people in several ways, both politically and socially:

1. **Political Fragmentation**: Herod's kingdom was divided among his three sons—Archelaus, Antipas, and Philip—and the territories were governed as tetrarchies rather than a singular kingdom. This fragmentation led to a lack of central authority and increased instability in Jewish governance, making it more challenging for the Jewish people to unite under a coherent political structure.

2. **Regional Governance and Jurisdiction**: Each tetrarch had significant autonomy and ruled over different regions (Judea and Samaria were controlled by Archelaus; Galilee and Perea by Antipas; and Iturea and Trachonitis by Philip). This brought about diverse local policies and practices, often leading to varying degrees of oppression or support for different local customs, religious practices, and taxation levels. As a result, the experience of Jews could differ markedly depending on where they lived.

3. **Religious Tensions**: The tetrarchs often faced challenges in balancing their rule with the religious leadership of the Jewish community. The division meant that local leaders could impose different religious regulations or engage with Roman authorities in ways that might not align with the broader Jewish community’s interests. For example, Antipas is noted for his conflicts with John the Baptist and his eventual role in the execution of Jesus, illustrating how local rulers could directly affect the religious landscape.

4. **Increased Roman Influence**: The tetrarchal system reinforced the presence of Roman authority in Judea, as the divisions were made under the oversight of the Roman Empire. This laid the groundwork for continued Roman control, culminating in political repression and contributing to the eventual Jewish revolt against Rome in 66 CE. The presence of local rulers who were seen as collaborating with Rome often deepened resentment among the Jewish populace.

5. **Social Division**: The division of Herod's kingdom compounded existing divisions among Jews. Different tetrarchies had varying economic conditions, cultures, and interactions with neighboring regions. The resulting regional distinctiveness could foster rivalries or jealousy, distracting from larger communal identity among the Jewish people.

6. **Opportunities for Revolt and Resistance**: The fragmentation of rule also provided opportunities for local leaders or groups to resist Roman authority, leading to sporadic revolts or movements among different regions. This was particularly evident in the decades following Herod’s death, as various groups sought to assert their independence or reform Judaism in response to perceived external threats.

Overall, the division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies created a complex environment for the Jewish people that was marked by both challenges and local variations in governance, religious life, and social dynamics.
