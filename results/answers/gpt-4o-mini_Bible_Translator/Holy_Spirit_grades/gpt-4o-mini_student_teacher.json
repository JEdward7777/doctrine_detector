  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit in contexts unfamiliar with the Trinity. They incorporated relevant biblical references, explained the roles of the Holy Spirit, emphasized God's presence through the Spirit, used relatable analogies, and encouraged open dialogue. However, the student's response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity from the outset, aligning with the reference answer's emphasis on sound teaching. Overall, a strong effort demonstrating a solid understanding of introducing the Holy Spirit in a clear and contextual manner."
