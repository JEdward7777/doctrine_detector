## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "hosts" in scripture is primarily used in reference to a multitude or an army, and it most commonly appears in the context of celestial beings, particularly angels. The phrase "Lord of hosts" (or "Yahweh of hosts") is a significant title for God found throughout the Old Testament, especially in the writings of the prophets. It denotes His sovereignty over both the heavenly armies (angels) and the earthly armies (nations).

1. **Celestial context**: In passages such as Psalm 103:21 and Isaiah 6:3, "hosts" refers to the heavenly beings who serve God. These references underscore God's authority over the spiritual realm, indicating that He commands these angelic forces.

2. **Military context**: The term can also denote earthly armies or a great multitude, used metaphorically to express God's power and support in battles. For instance, in 1 Samuel 17:45, David mentions fighting in the name of the Lord of hosts against Goliath, indicative of God's backing in physical conflict.

3. **Literary and theological significance**: The notion of "hosts" emphasizes God's omnipotence and control over all creation, reinforcing His ultimate authority. It encapsulates His capability to govern not only the cosmos but also the destinies of nations.

In summary, the term "hosts" in scripture encompasses both the angelic beings of the celestial realm and the armies of Israel or other nations, signifying God's supremacy in both spiritual and earthly matters.
