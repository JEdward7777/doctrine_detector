  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 85.\n\nThe student provided a thorough explanation of the term \"hosts\" in scripture, covering both the celestial and military contexts and highlighting its significance in emphasizing God's authority and power. The student effectively connected the term to spiritual warfare and divine authority, demonstrating an understanding of how this knowledge impacts a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. \n\nHowever, the student could have strengthened their answer by directly addressing the various aspects mentioned in the teacher's reference answer, such as including examples of celestial bodies like stars and planets in their explanation. Additionally, while the student provided a good analysis, a deeper exploration of the spiritual implications of God's authority over the hosts would have further enriched their response."
