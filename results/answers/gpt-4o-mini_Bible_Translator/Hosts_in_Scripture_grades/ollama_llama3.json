  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately captures the primary meaning of the term \"hosts\" in scripture, including its reference to angelic beings and armies of nations. The breakdown into celestial and military contexts is also helpful for understanding the nuances of the term. Additionally, the discussion on the literary and theological significance of the concept highlights God's sovereignty and omnipotence.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:\n\n* While the response touches on the idea that \"hosts\" can refer to celestial bodies, this aspect is not fully developed or explicitly stated.\n* The connection between the term \"hosts\" and spiritual warfare/divine authority, as specified in the concern, is not explicitly made. A more direct link between these concepts would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical concept of \"hosts,\" but could be further refined to better address the concern about spiritual warfare and divine authority."
