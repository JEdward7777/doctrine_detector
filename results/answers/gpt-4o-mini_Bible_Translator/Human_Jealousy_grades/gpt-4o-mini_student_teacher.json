They offered practical steps to address feelings of jealousy in relationships in a constructive manner. While the student's answer was comprehensive and aligned with Christian principles, it could have been more succinct and directly related to the concern provided. Additionally, the response could have focused more on the importance of recognizing jealousy as a warning sign in relationships, as emphasized in the reference answer."
