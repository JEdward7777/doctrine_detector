  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of reflecting on personal relationships and the impact of jealousy on them, providing a clear and well-structured framework for navigating jealous feelings in relationships. The incorporation of biblical references and principles adds depth and theological coherence to the response. The steps outlined (acknowledge feelings, reflect on source, communicate openly, practice gratitude, seek assurance, focus on personal growth, encourage others, pray for strength) are practical and helpful for individuals seeking to address jealousy in their relationships.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in its direct connection to the provided answer. While there is some overlap between the two, the response does not explicitly build upon or respond directly to the answer. To achieve a perfect score, the response would need to more clearly demonstrate how it expands upon or develops the ideas presented in the original answer.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates strong understanding and application of Christian principles to the concern of jealousy in personal relationships, making it an excellent example for reflection and practical implementation."
