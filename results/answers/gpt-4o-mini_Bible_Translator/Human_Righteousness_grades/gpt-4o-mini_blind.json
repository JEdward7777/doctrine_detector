  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation of how a person can be declared righteous according to the Christian faith. It correctly emphasizes the central role of faith in Jesus Christ, the concept of grace, justification, and the significance of Christ's sacrifice. One minor area for improvement could be providing a more explicit connection to the concept of imputed righteousness, where Christ's righteousness is credited to believers. Overall, an excellent explanation aligning well with Christian theology."
