## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, a person is declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. This concept is primarily derived from several key passages in the New Testament, particularly the writings of the Apostle Paul.

1. **Faith in Christ**: Central to Christian belief is the understanding that righteousness is not achieved through personal merit or adherence to the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. Romans 3:22 states, "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."

2. **Grace**: The doctrine of grace underscores that righteousness is a gift from God. Ephesians 2:8-9 emphasizes that salvation and righteousness come through grace and not by works, saying, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."

3. **Justification**: The process of being declared righteous is known as justification. Romans 5:1 teaches, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

4. **The Role of Christ's Sacrifice**: Christians believe that Jesus' death and resurrection provide the basis for this justification. 2 Corinthians 5:21 states, "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."

In summary, according to the Christian faith, a person is declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ, facilitated by God's grace, and grounded in the redemptive work of Christ on the cross. This understanding emphasizes the gift of salvation rather than human effort.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The LLM response provides a clear and concise explanation of how a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ, referencing several key biblical passages to support its claims. The response effectively emphasizes the role of God's grace and the redemptive work of Christ on the cross in facilitating justification.

The only area for improvement is that the LLM response does not explicitly state the importance of human effortlessness in achieving righteousness, which is a crucial aspect of the Christian doctrine of salvation. While the response does mention "God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesus' righteousness to them," it could be further developed to more clearly convey the idea that human efforts are not sufficient for achieving righteousness.

The concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is well-addressed by the LLM response, which provides a clear explanation of how faith in Jesus Christ leads to justification. Overall, the response effectively answers the concern and demonstrates a good understanding of Christian theology on this topic.
