  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a well-written and comprehensive response that provides practical and Biblically-based ways to ensure alignment between beliefs and actions in order to avoid hypocrisy. The incorporation of relevant Bible verses and Christian principles adds depth and authenticity to the answer. One minor suggestion for improvement could be to emphasize the role of the Holy Spirit in enabling believers to live out their faith authentically. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
