## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The name "Jesus" is derived from the Hebrew name "Yeshua," which means "Yahweh is salvation" or "the Lord saves." This is significant in terms of His purpose because it encapsulates the central mission of Jesus Christ as understood in Christian theology: He came to save humanity from sin and its consequences.

In the New Testament, specifically in Matthew 1:21, an angel instructs Joseph to name Mary’s son Jesus "because he will save his people from their sins." This highlights the redemptive purpose of His life and ministry. Through His death and resurrection, Christians believe Jesus provided a way for reconciliation between humanity and God, fulfilling the prophetic expectations of a Messiah who would bring salvation.

Thus, the name "Jesus" signifies not only His identity but also His divine purpose as the Savior and Redeemer, emphasizing God’s initiative to restore and redeem His creation.
