  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the roles of the Sadducees and Pharisees in the crucifixion of Jesus, highlighting their motivations and character traits. The response effectively connects their actions to the broader conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders of the time. However, the student could strengthen their answer by emphasizing more explicitly the moral and spiritual implications of the leaders' actions in light of a Christian worldview, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
