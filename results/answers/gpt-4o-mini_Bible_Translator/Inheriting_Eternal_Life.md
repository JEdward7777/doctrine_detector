According to the Bible, inheriting eternal life primarily involves faith in Jesus Christ and following His teachings. Here are some key scriptures that outline this concept:

1. **Faith in Jesus**: In John 3:16, it states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This emphasizes the necessity of faith in Jesus for eternal life.

2. **Repentance**: In Acts 2:38, Peter tells the crowds to "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." Repentance, or a sincere turning away from sin, is a crucial step.

3. **Obedience to God's Commandments**: In Matthew 19:16-17, a young man asks Jesus what he must do to gain eternal life. Jesus replies, "If you want to enter life, keep the commandments." Obedience to God's commandments is highlighted as important.

4. **Love**: In Matthew 22:37-40, Jesus teaches that the greatest commandments are to love God and love one’s neighbor. Living a life of love is essential to the Christian faith.

5. **Grace**: Ephesians 2:8-9 explains that salvation and eternal life are gifts of grace: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast." This underscores that eternal life cannot be earned but is graciously given by God.

In summary, according to the Bible, to inherit eternal life, one is called to have faith in Jesus Christ, genuinely repent of sin, live in obedience to God's commandments, and embrace the love that God commands, recognizing that this gift is ultimately by God's grace.
