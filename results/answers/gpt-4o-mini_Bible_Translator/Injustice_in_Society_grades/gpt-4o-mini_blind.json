  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of various injustices prevalent in the world today and offers a well-rounded set of responses consistent with Christian teachings. The inclusion of scriptural references and the emphasis on prayer, advocacy, education, service, community building, modeling justice, and speaking out align well with a Christian worldview. The only slight room for improvement could be including a stronger emphasis on the importance of spiritual warfare and reliance on God's strength in the face of such injustices. Overall, an excellent and well-articulated response."
