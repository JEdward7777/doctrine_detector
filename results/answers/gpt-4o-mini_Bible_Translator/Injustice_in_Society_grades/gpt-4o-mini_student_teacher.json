  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of examples of injustice in our world today and has suggested various ways in which Christians can respond to these injustices based on biblical principles. The answer aligns well with the concern provided, emphasizing the need for Christian activism against injustice and promotion of fairness. The suggested actions are relevant and grounded in Christian values. However, the response could have been strengthened by more explicitly tying the examples of injustice back to the broader Christian worldview and the specific reference answer provided by the teacher."
