  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer that delves into both Old and New Testament references regarding the concept of 'innocent blood.' The theological implications were clearly explained and tied back to the value of human life as depicted in the Bible. The student effectively addressed the concern by engaging with deeper discussions on justice, righteousness, and moral implications. Great job in incorporating relevant biblical passages to support the discussion."
