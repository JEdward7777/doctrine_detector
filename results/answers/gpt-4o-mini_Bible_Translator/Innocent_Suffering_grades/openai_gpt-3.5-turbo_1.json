  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of 'innocent blood' and effectively explores its theological implications as presented in both the Old and New Testaments. The analysis of relevant biblical passages and their connection to the sanctity of life is thorough and well-supported. The response also effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding this concept can lead to discussions on justice, righteousness, and moral implications in society."
