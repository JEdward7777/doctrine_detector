The integration of the sacrificial system and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus adds a valuable layer of understanding to the discussion. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the moral implications of societal treatment of individuals in light of the sanctity of life. Overall, this is a well-articulated and insightful analysis."
