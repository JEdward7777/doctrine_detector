The emphasis on themes of justice, resurrection, and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom aligns well with Christian teachings. However, there was no direct addressing of the specified concern regarding the urgency of faith in understanding judgment. Integrating a clear connection between judgment, faith, and the individual's relationship with God could have further strengthened the response."
