## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of worship, 'divine glory' can be understood as the visible manifestation of God's holiness, majesty, and power. It embodies the idea of God’s greatness and the reverence that believers owe to Him. Here are several key aspects to consider:

1. **Recognition of God's Nature**: Divine glory reflects the attributes of God—His sovereignty, righteousness, love, and holiness. When worshippers acknowledge God's glory, they are recognizing and affirming these attributes, leading to a deeper understanding of who God is.

2. **Manifestation in Creation**: The beauty and order of creation reflect God's glory. Scriptures like Psalm 19:1 state that "the heavens declare the glory of God." This understanding encourages worshippers to appreciate the world around them as a testament to God’s creative power.

3. **Presence in Worship**: In worship settings, divine glory often evokes an awareness of God’s presence. This can be experienced through communal worship, prayer, Scripture reading, and the sacraments, where believers may feel a profound connection to God that highlights His glory.

4. **Transformational Experience**: Encountering the glory of God can lead to transformation in the lives of worshippers. For instance, in Isaiah 6:1-5, the prophet encounters God's glory and is profoundly affected, recognizing his own sinfulness and need for purification. Worship can lead to repentance and spiritual renewal as individuals respond to God's glory.

5. **Eschatological Hope**: The concept of divine glory also ties into eschatology, as Christians look forward to a time when God's glory will be fully revealed in the new creation (Revelation 21:23). This hope shapes worship as believers anticipate the fullness of God’s presence.

6. **A Call to Proclaim**: Worship is not only about experiencing divine glory but also proclaiming it. Believers are called to declare God’s glory among the nations, as seen in Psalm 96:3. This emphasizes that worship is an act of sharing and manifesting God’s glory beyond the church walls.

In summary, understanding divine glory in the context of worship influences how believers approach God—recognizing His greatness, experiencing transformation, celebrating creation, and proclaiming His power to the world. It shapes the heart of worship, making it both a personal and communal experience that honors God's nature.
