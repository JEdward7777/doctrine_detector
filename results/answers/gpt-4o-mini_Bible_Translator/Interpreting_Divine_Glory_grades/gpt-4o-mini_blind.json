  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of how 'divine glory' can be understood in the context of worship from a Christian worldview. The response effectively integrates biblical references and theological concepts to support the understanding of divine glory, emphasizing key aspects such as God's nature, manifestation in creation, presence in worship, transformational experiences, eschatological hope, and the call to proclaim. The language is clear and concise, and the content is doctrinally sound, aligning well with Christian beliefs about the nature of God and the purpose of worship."
