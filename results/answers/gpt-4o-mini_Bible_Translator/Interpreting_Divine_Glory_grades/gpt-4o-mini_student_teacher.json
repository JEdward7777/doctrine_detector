  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 80.\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive exploration of 'divine glory' in the context of worship, connecting it to recognizing God's nature, creation, presence in worship, transformational experiences, eschatological hope, and the call to proclaim God's glory. The response shows a strong understanding of how divine glory influences worship practices and how it should shape believers' reverence and awe towards God. However, the student's focus on various aspects could have been strengthened by directly tying each point back to the central theme of recognizing God's glory as crucial in worship. Additionally, while the student's answer is thorough and well-reasoned, it could benefit from more direct references to biblical passages or theological doctrine to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
