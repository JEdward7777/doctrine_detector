# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The name 'Israel' has significant biblical origins, primarily rooted in the narrative of Genesis. It was given to the patriarch Jacob after he wrestled with a divine being at Peniel. In Genesis 32:28, God changes Jacob's name to Israel, which is commonly interpreted to mean "he who struggles with God" or "God contends." This reflects Jacob's literal wrestling match and symbolically signifies the struggles and relationship between God and His people.

In a broader biblical context, 'Israel' not only refers to Jacob himself but eventually comes to represent the entire nation of the descendants of Jacob (the Israelites). Throughout the Bible, Israel encompasses both the physical lineage of the Jewish people and, in a spiritual sense, can signify the people of God as a whole, including the church in the New Testament era. 

Thus, the name 'Israel' encapsulates themes of struggle, identity, and covenant relationship with God, exhibiting the complexity of human interaction with the divine.
