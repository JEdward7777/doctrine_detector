The answer only scratches the surface by saying that Jesus is the source of resurrection, without exploring the theological implications and significance of this statement in the context of John 11.\n\nThe concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection is addressed somewhat, but the response could have delved deeper into the biblical text to provide a more nuanced understanding. Specifically, the answer does not adequately address the issue of Jesus' authority over life and death, nor does it explore the connection between faith and access to eternal life.\n\nTo improve this response, the writer should have provided more theological analysis and interpretation of Jesus' statement, as well as explored its connections to other biblical passages and themes."
