  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful analysis of Jesus' declaration as \"the Resurrection and the Life\" within a Christian worldview. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, emphasizing the theological significance of His statement. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological implications and importance of faith in Jesus for believers. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more scriptural references to support the analysis further."
