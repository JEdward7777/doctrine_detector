## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, Jesus often used the term "amen" to emphasize the truth and authority of His teachings. The word "amen" is a Hebrew term that means "truly" or "surely," and it serves as an affirmation of the statements that follow. 

One notable way Jesus used "amen" is in the phrase "Truly, truly, I say to you," which appears frequently in the Gospel of John (e.g., John 3:3; John 5:24). This repetition of "truly" (the English translation of "amen") indicates a strong emphasis on the importance and truthfulness of His words. By using "amen" at the beginning of His statements, He affirmed that what He was about to say was of utmost significance and worthy of serious consideration.

Additionally, in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:18, 5:20), Jesus employs "amen" to underscore the inviolability of God's law and the righteousness that He expects from His followers. His use of "amen" highlights the certitude and divine backing behind His teachings.

Overall, through the use of "amen," Jesus communicated not just affirmation but also the authority of His message, inviting His listeners to genuinely reflect on and respond to His teachings.
