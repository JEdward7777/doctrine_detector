  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student provides a strong understanding of how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings, explaining its meaning and significance in affirming the truth and authority of His words. The examples cited from the Gospel of John and the Sermon on the Mount effectively demonstrate Jesus' use of \"amen\" to underscore the importance and seriousness of His teachings. Overall, the student's response aligns well with the reference answer, offering thoughtful insights into the use of \"amen\" by Jesus.\n\nHowever, the student could have further emphasized the recognition of Jesus' authority in Scripture, as per the specified concern. Including specific references to how the authority of Jesus as the Son of God influences the impact and weight of His teachings could have strengthened the answer in terms of a Christian worldview perspective."
