The discussion on how the repetition of \"truly\" in \"Truly, truly, I say to you\" emphasizes the importance and truthfulness of His words is particularly insightful. The response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, providing a thorough examination of how \"amen\" underscores the certitude and divine backing behind His messages. Great job in incorporating a Christian worldview perspective into the analysis."
