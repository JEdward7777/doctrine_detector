It effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture by highlighting how \"amen\" signifies the significance and certainty of His message. The connection between Jesus' use of \"amen\" and affirming the truth of His teachings is well articulated, showcasing a strong understanding from a Christian worldview. Well done!"
