The references to Hebrews and the comparison between Jesus' sacrifice and the sacrificial system of the Old Covenant are well articulated. The connection between Jesus' role as High Priest and the implications for human priests' sacrifices is clearly explained with doctrinal correctness. Great job overall!"
