  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of Jesus' role as our High Priest. The explanation of Jesus' sinlessness, his empathy with humanity, and the once-and-for-all nature of his sacrifice is clear and effectively tied to the significance for human priests and their sacrifices. The student effectively draws from Hebrews and other New Testament passages to support their points. The only minor improvement could be a more concise presentation, but overall, this is an excellent response."
