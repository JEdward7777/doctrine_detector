## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, Jesus is often referred to as our High Priest, particularly in the book of Hebrews. This designation signifies that Jesus fulfills the role and function of a priest in a way that surpasses the Levitical priesthood established in the Old Testament. 

Hebrews 4:14-16 emphasizes Jesus as a High Priest who understands human weaknesses because He was tempted in every way, yet without sin. This qualification allows Him to empathize with humanity and serve as an advocate before God. Additionally, Hebrews 7:26-27 highlights that Jesus does not need to offer sacrifices for His own sins, as human priests do, because He is sinless. Instead, His sacrificial death on the cross is presented as the once-and-for-all sacrifice for the sins of humanity.

The implications of Jesus' role as High Priest are profound for the sacrifices made by human priests. In the Old Covenant, priests offered animal sacrifices repeatedly for the atonement of sins, which were temporary and needed to be renewed. However, the New Testament teaches that Jesus' sacrifice was perfect and sufficient to atone for all sin (Hebrews 9:11-14). With His death and resurrection, the need for further sacrificial systems has been fulfilled, and believers are invited to approach God directly through Christ (Ephesians 2:18, Hebrews 10:19-22).

In summary, Jesus is referred to as our High Priest, which means that He has established a new covenant in which His once-for-all sacrifice renders the continuous sacrificial offerings of human priests unnecessary. This theology signifies a shift from the Old Covenant's sacrificial system to a new understanding of atonement and communion with God through Jesus Christ.
