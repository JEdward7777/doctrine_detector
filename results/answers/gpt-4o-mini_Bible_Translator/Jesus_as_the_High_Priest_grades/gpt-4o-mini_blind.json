The student effectively highlights key points such as Jesus being after the order of Melchizedek, his perfection as a high priest, his role as the mediator of a new covenant, his self-sacrifice, and his ongoing intercessory work. The explanation is doctrinally sound and demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural references and theological significance of Jesus' high priesthood. Great job!"
