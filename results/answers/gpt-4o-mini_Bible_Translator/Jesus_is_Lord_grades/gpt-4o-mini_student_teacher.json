  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively addresses the concern of differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The response offers clear explanations, practical communication strategies, and theological insights to emphasize the unique significance of declaring Jesus as Lord in contrast to political leaders. The student's suggestions demonstrate a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on this matter. The only area for improvement would be to align the response more closely with the reference answer by focusing on conciseness while maintaining the depth of explanation."
