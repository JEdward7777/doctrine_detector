  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 92.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The response provides several practical suggestions for communicating \"Jesus is Lord\" in a way that emphasizes its unique significance, including:\n\n* Clarifying the meaning of Jesus' lordship\n* Highlighting the contextual differentiation between Jesus' lordship and earthly authority\n* Providing historical context to underscore the radical nature of declaring Jesus as Lord\n* Using titles and emphasizing theological concepts to reinforce Jesus' role as Lord\n\nThe response also acknowledges the importance of considering cultural context in communicating this phrase. The only area for improvement is that the response could have been even more explicit in its differentiation between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles, but overall it does a excellent job of addressing this concern.\n\nComment: This response is strong because it not only identifies the need for clarification but also provides concrete suggestions for how to communicate \"Jesus is Lord\" in a way that honors its unique significance. The use of specific examples and theological concepts adds depth and nuance to the discussion, making it a compelling and effective approach."
