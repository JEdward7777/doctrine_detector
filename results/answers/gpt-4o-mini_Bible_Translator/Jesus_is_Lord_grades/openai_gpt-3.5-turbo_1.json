It offers practical steps and explanations rooted in Christian theology, historical context, and theological emphasis, enriching the understanding of the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also referred to as \"lord.\" The only minor improvement could be to further elaborate on how earthly rulers derive their authority compared to Jesus, but overall, this response effectively addresses the concern with clarity and depth."
