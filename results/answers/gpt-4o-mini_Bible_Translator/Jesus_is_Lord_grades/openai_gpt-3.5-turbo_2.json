It offers practical strategies for communicating this important theological concept in a context where earthly leaders are also referred to as \"lord\". The suggested points are clear, well-organized, and aligned with a Christian worldview, enhancing the understanding of Jesus' unique authority and supremacy. Great job in addressing the concern with depth and relevance."
