It appropriately highlights the key theological differences between Christianity and Islam regarding Jesus and provides a respectful way to address the discrepancy. However, a more direct and explicit clarification that Muslims do not believe in the concept of Jesus being the Son of God due to the belief in Tawhid could further strengthen the explanation. Overall, the response effectively navigates the delicate balance between the two faith perspectives."
