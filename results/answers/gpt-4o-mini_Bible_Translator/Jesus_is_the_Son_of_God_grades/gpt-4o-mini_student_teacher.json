  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful approach to translating the phrase \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context. They have made efforts to acknowledge both Christian and Islamic perspectives while emphasizing respect and understanding. However, the suggested approach could be improved by maintaining the original terminology more closely, as per the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student's answer provides a good balance between minimizing offense and maintaining theological accuracy."
