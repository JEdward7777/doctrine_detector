However, the suggested approach falls short of maintaining Biblical accuracy by not clearly stating that Jesus is indeed considered the Son of God in Christianity, which is a fundamental Christian belief. The response could have been stronger by emphasizing the importance of the divinity of Jesus in Christianity while still explaining the differences in Islamic belief."
