  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of biblical passages that address how Christians should judge each other, emphasizing principles such as love, humility, and restoration. While it does not directly address the specific concern about learning to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner, the provided scriptural instructions do offer practical guidance on how to do so.\n\nThe response effectively highlights key passages that caution against hypocrisy, emphasize gentle restoration, encourage righteous judgment, and promote constructive criticism. Additionally, the summary emphasizes the importance of love and seeking restoration rather than condemnation. However, it could be improved by more directly addressing the concern about approaching relationships in a Christ-like manner and providing concrete examples of how these biblical principles can be applied in practice.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of relevant biblical passages and provides useful guidance on how to navigate complex issues within Christian communities. With some further development to explicitly address the concern, it could receive a higher grade."
