The Bible provides several passages that speak to the topic of how Christians should judge each other, emphasizing principles of love, humility, and restoration. Here are some key scriptural instructions:

1. **Examine Yourself First**: 
   - In Matthew 7:1-5, Jesus teaches about judging others, where He cautions against hypocrisy. He advises individuals to first take the log out of their own eye before trying to remove the speck from their brother’s eye. This implies that self-examination and humility are crucial before offering correction.

2. **Restore with a Spirit of Gentleness**: 
   - Galatians 6:1 instructs Christians to restore someone caught in a trespass gently, being careful not to be tempted themselves. This emphasizes the importance of approaching correction with a caring attitude and an awareness of one’s own vulnerabilities.

3. **Judge Righteously**: 
   - John 7:24 urges believers to judge with right judgment rather than by appearances. This suggests that discernment should be based on truth and the character of God, rather than superficial or biased views.

4. **Don't Judge in a Condemning Manner**: 
   - Romans 14 deals with disputable matters and emphasizes that Christians should not pass judgment on one another regarding these issues. It states that each person is accountable to God and should be careful not to cause others to stumble.

5. **Constructive Criticism**: 
   - Ephesians 4:15 encourages speaking the truth in love. This highlights the importance of sharing concerns with the intention of helping and building up the community rather than tearing each other down.

6. **Community Accountability**: 
   - Matthew 18:15-17 provides a process for dealing with sin in the church. It instructs believers to approach someone who sins privately first, and if they do not listen, to bring one or two others along, and then, if necessary, to bring the matter before the church. This outlines a step-by-step approach to addressing sin within the community.

7. **Love Above All**: 
   - 1 Peter 4:8 underscores that love covers a multitude of sins. The underlying principle is that love should guide all interactions and judgments among believers, promoting forgiveness and grace.

In summary, the Biblical approach to judging each other emphasizes self-awareness, humility, gentleness, love, and the importance of seeking restoration rather than condemnation.
