  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive understanding of the biblical perspective on the Day of Judgment, emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus Christ and the evaluation of one's actions. The explanation of key passages and concepts is well articulated. However, the student could further strengthen the answer by delving deeper into the concept of repentance and acknowledging the role of God's justice in the final judgment. Additionally, integrating more Old Testament references to judgment could provide a broader biblical foundation for the explanation. Overall, a solid and well-informed response."
