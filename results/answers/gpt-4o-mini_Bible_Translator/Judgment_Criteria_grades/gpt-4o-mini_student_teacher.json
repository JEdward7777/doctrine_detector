  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that aligns closely with the biblical perspective on judgment. They have incorporated relevant scripture verses and key Christian theological principles. The emphasis on faith in Jesus Christ, works, separation of righteous and unrighteous, the Book of Life, and the role of grace and mercy are all highlighted effectively. The main discrepancy from the reference answer is the emphasis on faith alongside actions, whereas the reference answer focuses solely on actions. Overall, this is a strong response showcasing a good understanding of the biblical perspective on judgment."
