  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of Jesus' teachings on pointing out the faults of others in relation to our own faults, supported by relevant biblical references. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of self-examination, humility, and the need for personal growth before addressing the faults of others. The inclusion of Paul's teaching in Galatians further enriches the answer and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective. Very well done!"
