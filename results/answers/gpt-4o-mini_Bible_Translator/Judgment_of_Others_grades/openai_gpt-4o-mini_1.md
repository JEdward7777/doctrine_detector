## [Answer](../Judgment_of_Others.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Jesus teaches us about the importance of self-examination before we point out the faults of others in passages such as Matthew 7:1-5. In this section of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus cautions against judging others while being blind to our own shortcomings. He uses the metaphor of noticing a speck in someone else's eye while ignoring the plank in our own eye. 

The key takeaway from this teaching is that we should first address our own sinfulness and shortcomings before we attempt to correct or judge others. This emphasizes humility and self-reflection, urging us not to be hypocritical. Instead of being quick to criticize, Jesus encourages us to seek personal growth and repentance first, which, in turn, may enable us to help others with compassion and understanding.

Moreover, in Galatians 6:1, Paul teaches that if someone is caught in a sin, those who are spiritual should restore them gently, but he also warns to "keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted." This reinforces the idea that we must be mindful of our own faults and limitations in our interactions with others.

In summary, Jesus instructs us to prioritize addressing our own faults before confronting others, fostering an attitude of humility and genuine care in our relationships.
