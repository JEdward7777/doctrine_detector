## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
When translating the term "Kingdom of God" for cultures with no concept of kingdoms, it's important to consider both the original meaning and the cultural context. The phrase "Kingdom of God" encompasses themes of God's sovereignty, rule, and the transformative impact of His reign on individual lives and communities.

A few approaches can be taken:

1. **Conceptual Translation**: Instead of a direct phrase, one might rephrase it to reflect God's authority and His reign in a way that resonates with the local culture. For instance, terms like "God's Sovereignty" or "God's Rule" may be more understandable and carry similar implications.

2. **Metaphorical Language**: If the culture has other forms of governance or leadership, such as tribal councils or communal guidance, using those frameworks can help convey the concept. For example, "God as our Chief" or "God as our Leader" might work better.

3. **Theological Explanation**: In addition to rephrasing, it may be helpful to provide an explanation or footnote that describes what "Kingdom of God" means in a biblical context, emphasizing aspects like God's love, justice, and the community of believers.

Overall, the key is to communicate the essence of the term while ensuring that it is culturally relevant and theologically accurate. Engaging local believers in the translation process can also provide valuable insights into the most effective terminology.
