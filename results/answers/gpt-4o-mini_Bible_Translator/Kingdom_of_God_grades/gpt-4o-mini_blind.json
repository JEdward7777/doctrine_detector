  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This answer provides a thoughtful and balanced approach to addressing the question. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of maintaining the theological integrity of the term \"Kingdom of God\" while adapting it for cultures without a concept of kingdoms. The suggestions given for conceptual translation, metaphorical language, and theological explanation are sound and aligned with a Christian worldview. Engaging local believers in the translation process is also a wise suggestion. The response could be strengthened by providing specific biblical references to support the theological implications of the term \"Kingdom of God\" and by emphasizing the biblical basis for the various approaches mentioned. Overall, a well-reasoned and insightful answer."
