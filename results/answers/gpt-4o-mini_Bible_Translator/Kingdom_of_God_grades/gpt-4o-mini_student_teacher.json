  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful approaches to translating \"Kingdom of God\" for cultures without a concept of kingdoms, taking into consideration the original meaning and cultural context. However, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes retaining the term for its spiritual and eschatological significance, which the student's response did not fully align with. Additionally, the concern about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term through rephrasing was not directly addressed in the student's answer. The student's suggestions were sound, but could be enhanced by emphasizing the importance of retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' itself."
