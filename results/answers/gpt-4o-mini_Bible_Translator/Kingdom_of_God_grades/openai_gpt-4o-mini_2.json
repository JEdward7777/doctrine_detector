  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides thoughtful and culturally sensitive approaches to translating the term \"Kingdom of God\" while maintaining the original depth and biblical context. The suggestions presented show an understanding of the importance of preserving the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. The concern regarding rephrasing losing the depth of the term is adequately addressed by advocating for retention with explanatory notes. Overall, this response demonstrates a balanced consideration of both the cultural and theological aspects involved in translation."
