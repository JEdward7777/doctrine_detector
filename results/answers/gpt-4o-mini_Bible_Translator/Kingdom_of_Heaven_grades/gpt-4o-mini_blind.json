  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-articulated and thorough explanation of why retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the book of Matthew is important. They have effectively highlighted the biblical context, theological implications, distinctive identity, ecclesiological significance, and cultural resonance of the term. However, to enhance this response further, they could have linked the concept of \"kingdom of heaven\" to Jesus' teachings on the kingdom throughout Matthew's Gospel. Additionally, emphasizing the significance of heaven as the dwelling place of God and the ultimate goal for believers in the eschatological sense would have added depth to the theological implications discussed."
