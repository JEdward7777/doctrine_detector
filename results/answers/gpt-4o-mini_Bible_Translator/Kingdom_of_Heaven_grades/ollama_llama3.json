The concerns are well- addressed, as the response delves into the distinctive language and nuances of Matthew's Gospel, demonstrating an understanding of the intended message of the biblical author.\n\nThe response also touches on the cultural resonance of \"heaven\" for the original audience, which adds depth to its analysis.
