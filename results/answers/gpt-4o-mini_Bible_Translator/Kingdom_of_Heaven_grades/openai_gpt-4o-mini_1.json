It effectively addresses the concern by explaining how understanding the unique terminology used in the Gospels aids in grasping the intended messages of the biblical authors. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively connects the use of \"heaven\" to the theological implications of God's reign in Matthew's Gospel."
