  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 100. \n\nThe answer correctly identifies Hebrew as the language in which the vast majority of the Old Testament was written. It also acknowledges the presence of Aramaic in certain portions of the Old Testament, specifically in the books of Daniel and Ezra. Overall, the response is accurate and demonstrates a clear understanding of the languages used in the Old Testament. Great job!"
