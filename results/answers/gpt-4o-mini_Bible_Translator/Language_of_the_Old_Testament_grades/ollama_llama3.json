  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides accurate information about the language in which the Old Testament was written, specifically highlighting Hebrew as the primary language. It also mentions Aramaic as being used in certain books, which is correct. However, the response could be improved by providing more context and explanation about why understanding the original languages of the Bible is important for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context.\n\nThe concern emphasizes the importance of this knowledge for proper biblical interpretation, and while the response touches on it, it does not fully flesh out the significance of knowing the original languages. Nevertheless, the response does provide a solid foundation upon which further exploration can be built. Therefore, I would give it an 80.\n\nComment: The response shows good understanding of the language in which the Old Testament was written, but could benefit from more explanation on why this knowledge is essential for biblical study and interpretation."
