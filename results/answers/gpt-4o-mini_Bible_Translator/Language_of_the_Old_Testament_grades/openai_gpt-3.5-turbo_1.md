Comment: The response accurately identifies that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is crucial for studying the Scriptures and grasping their original context. The mention of Aramaic in specific books adds depth to the explanation but is not essential to addressing the concern at hand. Overall, a very strong response with minor room for improvement.
