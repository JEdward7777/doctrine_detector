## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, particularly in the letters of Paul and the Acts of the Apostles, we see that early believers typically met in various settings, often characterizing their gatherings with particular practices and purposes. 

1. **Home Gatherings**: Many early Christians met in homes, as there were no church buildings in the early years of the church. Key figures, such as Lydia in Philippi (Acts 16:15) and Philemon, hosted church gatherings in their homes.

2. **Teaching and Fellowship**: Believers gathered for teaching, prayer, breaking of bread (communion), and fellowship. Acts 2:42 describes the early church as devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, the breaking of bread, and prayer.

3. **Public Worship**: In larger cities, Christians might also meet in public places, such as synagogues or the temple (as seen in Acts 3:1 and Acts 13:5), especially during the early years when they were often worshipping alongside Jews.

4. **Worship and Prayer**: Meetings were typically characterized by collective worship, singing, praying, and sharing testimonies (Colossians 3:16).

5. **Caring for One Another**: The gatherings were also meant to encourage and care for one another, which included sharing resources, ministry to the poor, and addressing spiritual needs (Acts 2:44-45).

Believers' gatherings were fundamentally centered around Christ, aiming to grow in faith and community while advancing the Gospel.
