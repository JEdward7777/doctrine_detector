It also highlights the symbolic significance of the bread and wine as representing Jesus' body and blood. The inclusion of theological concepts such as redemption, community, and the new covenant established through Christ demonstrates a deeper understanding of the sacrament's significance. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the historical context of the Passover meal and its connection to the Lord's Supper tradition."
