## [Answer](../Lord_s_Supper_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist, commemorates the Last Supper that Jesus shared with His disciples before His crucifixion. During this meal, Jesus instituted the practice by breaking bread and sharing wine, signifying His body and blood, which would be given for the forgiveness of sins. This event holds deep theological significance as it represents Jesus’ sacrificial death, His covenant with believers, and the ongoing remembrance of His sacrifice until His return. It emphasizes themes of redemption, community, and the new covenant established through Christ.

**Grade:** 85/100

**Comment:** 
The student's answer correctly identifies the primary event commemorated by the Lord's Supper as the Last Supper shared by Jesus and his disciples. It also highlights the symbolic significance of the bread and wine as representing Jesus' body and blood. The inclusion of theological concepts such as redemption, community, and the new covenant established through Christ demonstrates a deeper understanding of the sacrament's significance. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the historical context of the Passover meal and its connection to the Lord's Supper tradition.
