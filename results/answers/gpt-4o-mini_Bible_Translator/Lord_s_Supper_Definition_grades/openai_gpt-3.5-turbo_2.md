## [Answer](../Lord_s_Supper_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist, commemorates the Last Supper that Jesus shared with His disciples before His crucifixion. During this meal, Jesus instituted the practice by breaking bread and sharing wine, signifying His body and blood, which would be given for the forgiveness of sins. This event holds deep theological significance as it represents Jesus’ sacrificial death, His covenant with believers, and the ongoing remembrance of His sacrifice until His return. It emphasizes themes of redemption, community, and the new covenant established through Christ.
