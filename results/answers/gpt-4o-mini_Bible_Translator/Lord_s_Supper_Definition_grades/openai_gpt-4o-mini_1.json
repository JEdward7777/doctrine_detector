It appropriately acknowledges the Last Supper as the event where Jesus instituted the practice, highlights the theological significance, and emphasizes themes of redemption and the new covenant. However, it could have elaborated more on the ongoing remembrance aspect and how it connects believers to Christ's sacrifice until His return."
