  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer that aligns with a Christian worldview by highlighting key biblical passages and principles regarding forgiveness. They effectively connected forgiveness to reflecting God's nature, following Christ's teachings, promoting reconciliation, liberating the forgiver, demonstrating true love, and serving as a witness to the world. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on the central theme of forgiveness as reflecting God's unconditional love, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer."
