It also offers practical principles for couples to follow in nurturing a strong, Christ-centered marriage. The content aligns well with promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God\u2019s design for relationships. The only small suggestion for improvement would be to possibly provide more specific examples or real-life applications to further illustrate the concepts discussed."
