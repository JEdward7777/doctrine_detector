  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer listing multiple passages from the New Testament where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. However, the concern mentioned being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings specifically focused on Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The student could have improved their answer by focusing solely on these three books as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
