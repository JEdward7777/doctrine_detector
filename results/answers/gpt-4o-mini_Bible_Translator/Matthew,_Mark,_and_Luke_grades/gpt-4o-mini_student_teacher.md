## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The names of the twelve disciples are listed in several places in the New Testament. The primary passages are:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage provides a list of the twelve apostles.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - This passage also lists the twelve apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - Here, the names of the apostles are included.
4. **Acts 1:13** - This verse mentions the apostles, following the ascension of Jesus.

These listings provide the names of the twelve disciples chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers. The lists may vary slightly in order or in the names mentioned, but they all identify the same key figures in the ministry of Jesus.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive answer listing multiple passages from the New Testament where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. However, the concern mentioned being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings specifically focused on Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The student could have improved their answer by focusing solely on these three books as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated.
