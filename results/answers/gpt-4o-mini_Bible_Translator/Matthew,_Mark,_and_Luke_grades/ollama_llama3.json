  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the three books (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) where the names of the twelve disciples are listed, which aligns with the given answer. This demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical accounts and their teachings, particularly in relation to the lists of apostles found within them.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not provide specific references or details about the passages mentioned (e.g., Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:13-16). While it acknowledges that the names are listed in these books, it does not delve deeper into the scriptural evidence. A more comprehensive response would have provided additional context and details from each passage.\n\nOverall, this response shows a good foundation of biblical knowledge, but could benefit from further exploration and explanation of the specific passages mentioned."
