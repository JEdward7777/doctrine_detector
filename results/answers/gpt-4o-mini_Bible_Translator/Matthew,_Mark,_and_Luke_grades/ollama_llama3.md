Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings.

## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The names of the twelve disciples are listed in several places in the New Testament. The primary passages are:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage provides a list of the twelve apostles.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - This passage also lists the twelve apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - Here, the names of the apostles are included.
4. **Acts 1:13** - This verse mentions the apostles, following the ascension of Jesus.

These listings provide the names of the twelve disciples chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers. The lists may vary slightly in order or in the names mentioned, but they all identify the same key figures in the ministry of Jesus.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately identifies the three books (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) where the names of the twelve disciples are listed, which aligns with the given answer. This demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical accounts and their teachings, particularly in relation to the lists of apostles found within them.

However, I would deduct points because the response does not provide specific references or details about the passages mentioned (e.g., Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:13-16). While it acknowledges that the names are listed in these books, it does not delve deeper into the scriptural evidence. A more comprehensive response would have provided additional context and details from each passage.

Overall, this response shows a good foundation of biblical knowledge, but could benefit from further exploration and explanation of the specific passages mentioned.
