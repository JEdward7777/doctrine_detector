## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The names of the twelve disciples are listed in several places in the New Testament. The primary passages are:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage provides a list of the twelve apostles.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - This passage also lists the twelve apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - Here, the names of the apostles are included.
4. **Acts 1:13** - This verse mentions the apostles, following the ascension of Jesus.

These listings provide the names of the twelve disciples chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers. The lists may vary slightly in order or in the names mentioned, but they all identify the same key figures in the ministry of Jesus.

Comment: The response accurately identifies the primary passages in the New Testament where the names of the twelve disciples are listed and acknowledges that the lists may vary slightly. It demonstrates a good understanding of the sources within the Gospel accounts. The only improvement could be to provide a bit more detail or insight into the significance of the twelve disciples within the context of Jesus' ministry, which would enhance the depth of the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
