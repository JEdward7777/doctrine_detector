The names of the twelve disciples are listed in several places in the New Testament. The primary passages are:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage provides a list of the twelve apostles.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - This passage also lists the twelve apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - Here, the names of the apostles are included.
4. **Acts 1:13** - This verse mentions the apostles, following the ascension of Jesus.
