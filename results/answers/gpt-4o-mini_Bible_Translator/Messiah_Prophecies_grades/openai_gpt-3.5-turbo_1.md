The Old Testament contains numerous prophecies concerning the Messiah, which Christians believe Jesus Christ fulfilled in various ways. Here are some significant prophecies along with explanations of how they are viewed as fulfilled by Jesus:

1. **Born of a Virgin**:
   - **Prophecy**: Isaiah 7:14 states that a virgin will conceive and bear a son, and he will be called Emmanuel, which means "God with us."

2. **Born in Bethlehem**:
   - **Prophecy**: Micah 5:2 predicts that the Messiah will be born in Bethlehem.
   - **Fulfillment**: The Gospel of Matthew 2:1 confirms that Jesus was born in Bethlehem.

3. **A Descendant of Abraham**:
   - **Prophecy**: Genesis 12:3 promises that through Abraham's offspring, all nations will be blessed.
   - **Fulfillment**: The New Testament emphasizes that Jesus is a descendant of Abraham (Matthew 1:1).

4. **From the Line of David**:
   - **Prophecy**: Jeremiah 23:5 speaks of a righteous branch from David's line who will reign as king.
   - **Fulfillment**: Jesus is identified as a descendant of David in the genealogies provided in the Gospels (Matthew 1:1-16).

5. **Betrayed for Thirty Pieces of Silver**:
   - **Prophecy**: Zechariah 11:12-13 foretells that the Messiah would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver.
   - **Fulfillment**: In Matthew 26:14-15, Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus for this exact amount.

6. **Crucifixion**:
   - **Prophecy**: Psalm 22 describes suffering and the manner of death, including details that Christians see as foreshadowing crucifixion.
   - **Fulfillment**: The accounts of Jesus' crucifixion in the Gospels show multiple associations with this psalm, including the casting of lots for his clothing (John 19:23-24).

7. **Resurrection**:
   - **Prophecy**: Psalm 16:10 speaks of God not abandoning His Holy One to the grave, suggesting resurrection.
   - **Fulfillment**: Christians believe that Jesusâ€™ resurrection on the third day (Luke 24:6-7) fulfills this prophecy.

8. **Ascend to the Right Hand of God**:
   - **Prophecy**: Psalm 110:1 states that the Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand."
   - **Fulfillment**: Acts 2:33 refers to Jesus being exalted and seated at the right hand of God after His ascension.

9. **The Messiah brings Good News**:
   - **Prophecy**: Isaiah 61:1 speaks of one anointed to bring good news to the poor and healing to the brokenhearted.
   - **Fulfillment**: Jesus quotes this passage in Luke 4:18-21, indicating that he is the fulfillment of this mission.

These examples illustrate how Christians interpret the prophecies of the Old Testament as being directly fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, affirming their belief in Him as the Messiah.
