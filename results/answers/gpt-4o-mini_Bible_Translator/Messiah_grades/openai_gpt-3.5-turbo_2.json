The inclusion of other religious savior figures, such as the Mahdi in Islam, is informative for understanding different perspectives. However, the response could further emphasize the distinctiveness of Jesus as the divine Messiah in Christianity compared to other beliefs, ensuring a strong focus on Biblical teachings to clearly differentiate His role."
