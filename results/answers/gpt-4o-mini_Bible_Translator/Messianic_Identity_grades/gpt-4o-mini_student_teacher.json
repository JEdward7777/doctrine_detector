  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of the title 'King of the Jews' in relation to Jesus' identity as the Messiah. They provide detailed explanations supported by scripture references and historical context. While their response is comprehensive and insightful, there is a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer in terms of emphasizing Jesus' eternal reign. Overall, the student's answer effectively ties in the messianic expectations, prophetic fulfillment, Roman context, universal reign, and spiritual kingdom aspects, showcasing a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on Jesus' identity."
