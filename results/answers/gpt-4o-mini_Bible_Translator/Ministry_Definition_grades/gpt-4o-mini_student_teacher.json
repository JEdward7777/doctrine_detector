  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that aligns with a Christian worldview on ministering to others according to the Bible. They covered various aspects such as service, sharing the Gospel, compassion, encouragement, prayer, spiritual gifts, and acts of justice and mercy. However, the student's response is more detailed and broader than the teacher's reference answer, which may sometimes stray a bit from the specific concern of understanding the biblical definition of ministry. It may be seen as slightly overreaching in its scope. Nevertheless, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and effectively incorporated relevant Bible verses."
