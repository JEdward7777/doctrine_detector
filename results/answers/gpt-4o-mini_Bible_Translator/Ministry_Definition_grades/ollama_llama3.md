## [Answer](../Ministry_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
To 'minister' to others according to the Bible encompasses a variety of actions and attitudes that reflect service, care, and the sharing of God’s love and truth. The concept of ministry is rooted in the life and example of Jesus Christ, who came not to be served, but to serve (Mark 10:45).

Here are some key aspects of what it means to minister to others:

1. **Service**: At its core, to minister is to serve others. Jesus modeled this through acts of kindness, compassion, healing, and teaching. In John 13:12-15, Jesus washed His disciples' feet, demonstrating that true leadership involves humility and servanthood.

2. **Sharing the Gospel**: Ministry also involves proclaiming the message of Jesus Christ. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) calls Christians to go out into the world, make disciples, and share the good news of salvation.

3. **Compassion and Care**: Ministering often includes meeting the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of others. This can be seen in passages such as Matthew 25:35-40, where Jesus identifies with the needy, stating that serving “the least of these” is akin to serving Him.

4. **Encouragement and Edification**: In the New Testament, believers are encouraged to build one another up (1 Thessalonians 5:11). This can involve providing comfort, encouragement, and spiritual guidance to help others grow in their faith.

5. **Prayer and Intercession**: Ministering can also include praying for others and interceding on their behalf (James 5:16). Prayer is a vital aspect of Christian ministry, demonstrating care and reliance on God.

6. **Spiritual Gifts**: The Bible speaks of various spiritual gifts given to believers (1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12). Ministering can involve using these gifts for the common good and building up the body of Christ.

7. **Acts of Justice and Mercy**: Ministry can extend to social justice and advocating for the marginalized. Scriptures like Micah 6:8 remind believers to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God.

Overall, to minister in the biblical sense is to embody Christ’s love through selfless service, teaching, and acts of kindness, reflecting the heart of God towards others. As believers minister, they participate in fulfilling God’s mission on earth and express the love of Christ in tangible ways.

The writer effectively connects the concept of ministry to the life and example of Jesus Christ, and provides several key aspects of ministry that are rooted in Scripture.
