They effectively connected myrrh to Jesus' suffering, death, and royalty, as well as its representation of his humanity and the cultural context of the gift. The student's response aligned well with the Christian worldview and deepened the understanding of Jesus' purpose and mission, making it a strong and insightful analysis."
