  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns closely with the reference answer. They effectively highlighted key passages from the New Testament and emphasized the importance of love, humility, and encouragement in exhortation. The only area for improvement would be to perhaps simplify the explanation and focus more on the central theme of exhorting in love, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a solid understanding of how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament."
