The inclusion of scriptural references, such as the parable of the Prodigal Son and the Lord's Prayer, strengthens the argument and demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian beliefs. The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring the moral and relational attributes of God, showcasing how forgiveness reflects God's grace, mercy, justice, and desire for reconciliation. Great job in integrating these concepts within a Christian worldview."
