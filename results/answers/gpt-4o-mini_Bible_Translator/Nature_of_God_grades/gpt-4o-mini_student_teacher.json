  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of the implications of God being a Spirit on worship, exploring theological truths and practical applications. They effectively articulate the immaterial nature of God and the need for genuine spiritual engagement in worship. The student also connects the concept of God as Spirit to the call for authentic worship in spirit and truth. The only area for improvement could be to incorporate more direct references to scripture to strengthen the biblical foundation of their argument. Overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding of the essence of God and its impact on worship."
