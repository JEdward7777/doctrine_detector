  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of the theological implications of understanding God as Spirit in relation to worship. It effectively addresses the concern by delving into the nature of God, the immateriality of God, worship in spirit and truth, and the practical implications on personal worship practices. The integration of relevant Biblical references and the implications for believers are well-articulated, demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
