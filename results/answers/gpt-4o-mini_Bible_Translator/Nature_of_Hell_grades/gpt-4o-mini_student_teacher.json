  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer on the nature and experience of hell according to the Bible. They referenced relevant scriptures and theological concepts to support their points. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on a few key aspects to enhance clarity. Additionally, while they covered various dimensions of hell, the student could have emphasized more the severity and purpose of hell as it relates to the Christian view of judgment and salvation."
