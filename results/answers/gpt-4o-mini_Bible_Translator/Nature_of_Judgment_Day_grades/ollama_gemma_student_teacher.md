## [Answer](../Nature_of_Judgment_Day.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, "Judgment Day" refers to the future event when God will judge all humanity for their actions, faith, and decision-making during their lives on Earth. This concept is deeply rooted in various passages of the Bible.

1. **The Final Judgment**: This is often associated with the "Great White Throne Judgment" described in Revelation 20:11-15. Here, it is stated that the dead will be judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books, and anyone whose name is not found in the Book of Life will be cast into the lake of fire.

2. **Separation of the Righteous and the Wicked**: In Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus describes the Son of Man coming in glory to separate the sheep (the righteous) from the goats (the wicked). The righteous are welcomed into eternal life while the wicked are sent away to eternal punishment.

3. **The Accountability of Everyone**: Romans 14:10-12 indicates that we will all stand before God's judgment seat, reinforcing the idea that every individual will be accountable for their life and choices.

4. **The Role of Faith**: According to John 3:16-18, belief in Jesus Christ is pivotal, with eternal life granted to those who believe in Him, and condemnation pending for those who do not believe.

In summary, Judgment Day represents a time of ultimate accountability and divine justice where God's righteousness will be fully realized, revealing His mercy towards the faithful and His justice towards those who reject Him.
