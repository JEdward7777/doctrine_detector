  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate description of the appearance and taste of manna as described in the Bible. They correctly referenced relevant passages and highlighted the key characteristics. However, they included additional details that were not directly mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. While this demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, it is important to stick strictly to the given answer to fully align with the Christian-specific worldview."
