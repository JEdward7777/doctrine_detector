## [Answer](../Nature_of_Manna.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, manna is described as a miraculous food provided by God to the Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt. The appearance and taste of manna are described in several passages, primarily in the book of Exodus and Numbers.

1. **Appearance**: In Exodus 16:14, manna is described as being "like white coriander seed" and "the appearance of it was like that of bdellium" (a resin type). This indicates that it had a small, round, and white appearance.

2. **Taste**: Exodus 16:31 states that the taste of manna was like "wafers made with honey." This suggests that it had a sweet flavor, likened to a delicate, honey-flavored wafer.

In summary, manna is portrayed as a small, white food with a taste reminiscent of sweet wafers, nourishing the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness.
