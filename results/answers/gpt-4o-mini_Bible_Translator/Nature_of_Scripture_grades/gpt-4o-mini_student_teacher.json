  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough and thoughtful answer that accurately distinguishes between the terms \"scripture\" and \"the word of God\" within the biblical context. Their explanation is well-supported with relevant biblical references and demonstrates a good understanding of how these terms are related but convey different nuances. Additionally, the student appropriately acknowledges the broader application of the phrase \"the word of God\" beyond written scripture to encompass God's communication through Christ.\n\nWhile the student's answer expands on the relationship between scripture and the word of God beyond the given reference answer, their explanation aligns with Christian teachings and offers a valuable perspective on the subject matter."
