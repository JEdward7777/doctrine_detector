  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical context, using specific verses to support their points. They correctly identify that \"scripture\" refers specifically to written texts (Old Testament and New Testament), while \"the word of God\" can refer to both written scripture and God's spoken word. The writer also acknowledges the importance of Jesus as the ultimate revelation of God.\n\nHowever, the response could be more comprehensive in addressing the concern about clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word. While they do touch on this issue, they could have explored it further and provided more specific examples or insights to support their claims.\n\nOverall, the response is well-organized and effectively uses biblical references to support its points. With some additional development of the ideas related to clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word, the response could be even stronger."
