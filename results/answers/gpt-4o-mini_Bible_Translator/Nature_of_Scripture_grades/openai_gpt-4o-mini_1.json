  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word within a Christian worldview. It effectively clarifies that scripture specifically refers to the written texts recognized as authoritative and inspired by God, while the word of God encompasses a broader application including God's revelation through Christ and the Holy Spirit. The Biblical references provided support the explanation well. The only area that could further improve the response is to explicitly highlight the divine inspiration and authority of scripture as God's spoken word to humanity."
