## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, both our sinful nature and external influences play significant roles in temptation.

1. **Sinful Nature**: The doctrine of original sin suggests that all humans inherit a sinful nature from Adam and Eve. This inherent sinful condition predisposes individuals to desire sin and rebel against God's commands. The Apostle Paul, in Romans 7:18, expresses the struggle with the sinful nature, stating, "For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh." The sinful nature is often seen as a source of temptation, leading individuals to act contrary to God's will.

2. **External Influences**: In addition to our internal predispositions, external factors also contribute to temptation. These can include societal pressures, negative influences from peers, and the allure of sinful environments. Additionally, Scripture speaks of spiritual warfare, indicating that Satan and his forces can play a role in tempting individuals (Ephesians 6:12). James 1:14-15 highlights this dynamic, stating, "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin..."

In summary, the interplay between our sinful nature and external influences shapes our experience of temptation. The sinful nature provides the internal inclination toward sin, while external influences can exacerbate or exploit these inclinations. Believers are called to resist temptation through reliance on God's grace, the power of the Holy Spirit, and adherence to Scriptural truths.
