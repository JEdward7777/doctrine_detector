  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the concept of wickedness according to the Bible, citing relevant verses and explaining the implications of wicked actions. The student effectively captures the essence of wickedness, its consequences, the call to repentance, and the contrast between righteousness and wickedness. However, to improve the grade, the answer could incorporate more scriptural references and delve deeper into the theological implications of wickedness and God's response to it. Additionally, further exploration of the transformative power of God's grace and forgiveness in the context of repentance could enhance the completeness of the response."
