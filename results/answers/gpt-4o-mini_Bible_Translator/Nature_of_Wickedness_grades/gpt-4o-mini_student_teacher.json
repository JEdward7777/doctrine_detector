  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of how the Bible portrays wickedness in individuals, with references to relevant verses and concepts. The answer effectively highlights the definition of wickedness, its nature, consequences, call to repentance, and the contrast between the righteous and the wicked. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on how biblical perspectives on wickedness can influence moral behavior and spiritual growth, as outlined in the concern. Additionally, the answer could have more directly connected the implications of wickedness to moral behavior and spiritual growth for a deeper analysis."
