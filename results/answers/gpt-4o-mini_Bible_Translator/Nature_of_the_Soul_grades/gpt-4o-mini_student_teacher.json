  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the differentiation between the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible. They have effectively outlined the definitions, biblical examples, common usage, and theological implications of these terms. However, the student's answer does not fully align with the reference answer given by the teacher, which states that the Bible may present 'soul' and 'spirit' as interchangeable terms. It would have been beneficial for the student to acknowledge this perspective and perhaps address it in their response for a more comprehensive understanding."
