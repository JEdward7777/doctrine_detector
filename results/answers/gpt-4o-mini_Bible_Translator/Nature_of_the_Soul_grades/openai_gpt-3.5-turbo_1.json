  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and thorough explanation of the distinctions between 'soul' and 'spirit' in a biblical context, referencing relevant scripture passages and theological implications. It acknowledges the importance of understanding these definitions for interpreting scripture accurately regarding human nature and relationship with God. The only potential improvement could be discussing more explicitly the importance of recognizing these distinctions rather than presenting them as potentially interchangeable, aligning more closely with the concern raised."
