  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and well-explained differentiation between the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible, emphasizing their distinct theological and philosophical implications. The analysis of biblical examples and common usage effectively supports the argument. The clarity and depth of explanation demonstrate a solid understanding of the topic. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly address the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the biblical definitions for accurate interpretation of Scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God."
