  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85/100.\n\nThe student has correctly identified and explained the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. They have mentioned abstaining from wine and strong drink, avoiding haircuts, and avoiding ritual defilement, and have provided a brief explanation for each restriction. The explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the significance of these restrictions in the context of the Nazirite vow.\n\nHowever, to improve the grade, the student could have elaborated more on the cultural and religious significance of each restriction within the context of the Nazirite vow. Providing additional depth and insight into each restriction would have enhanced the overall response."
