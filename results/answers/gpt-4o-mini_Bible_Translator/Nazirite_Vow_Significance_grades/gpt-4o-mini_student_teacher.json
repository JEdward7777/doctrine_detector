  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer outlining the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. They have accurately identified and explained the restrictions related to abstaining from wine and strong drink, avoiding haircuts, and avoiding ritual defilement. The student also highlighted the symbolic significance of these restrictions in reflecting dedication to God. However, the student's answer includes additional details beyond what was specified in the teacher's reference answer. To improve their grade, they could focus more on directly addressing the specific concerns mentioned in the reference answer."
