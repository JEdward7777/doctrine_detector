## [Answer](../Nazirite_Vow_Significance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Nazirite vow, as described in Numbers 6:1-4, involves several key restrictions that an individual agrees to follow for a specific period. The main restrictions are:

1. **Abstaining from Wine and Strong Drink**: The Nazirite must avoid consuming wine, strong drink, or any products derived from the grapevine, including grape juice, grapes, and raisins.

2. **Avoiding Haircuts**: The individual must not cut their hair for the duration of the vow. The hair is considered a sign of the vow's sanctity and devotion.

3. **Avoiding Ritual Defilement**: The Nazirite must not come into contact with dead bodies or graves, even if they are close relatives. This is to maintain their ritual purity throughout the duration of the vow.

These restrictions are meant to symbolize a dedication to God and a separation from ordinary life, reflecting a commitment to holiness and service during the vow.
