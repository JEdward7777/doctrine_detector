  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful explanation of the instructions and examples regarding the use of Psalms in the New Testament, showcasing the relevance and importance of Psalms in Christian worship. However, the student's answer could have been more focused on the specific instruction given in the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasized singing Psalms to God as a way of worship. The student's response covered a broader range of aspects related to Psalms in the New Testament but lacked direct alignment with the specific instruction mentioned in the reference answer."
