## [Answer](../New_Testament_Instruction.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, Christians receive several instructions and examples regarding the use of Psalms, highlighting their importance in worship and spiritual life. Here are a few key points:

1. **Encouragement to Sing Psalms**: In Ephesians 5:19, Paul instructs believers to "speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit." This encourages the communal and individual use of Psalms as a way to express worship and build up the church.

2. **Reflection of Christ**: Jesus Himself quoted from the Psalms frequently, illustrating their fulfillment and relevance (for instance, in Matthew 22:44, He refers to Psalm 110). This shows how the Psalms speak to the life and mission of Christ and encourages believers to seek understanding of how the Old Testament, including Psalms, points to Him.

3. **Prayer and Lament**: The Psalms serve as a model for prayer and lament. James 5:13 encourages believers to “sing songs of praise,” which could include psalms. The Psalms’ expressions of distress and pleas for help are also reflected in the Christian life, as seen in Hebrews 5:7, which notes how Jesus offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries.

4. **Instruction and Teaching**: Colossians 3:16 encourages Christians to let the message of Christ dwell among them richly, teaching and admonishing one another "with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit." This indicates that the Psalms are a crucial part of Christian teaching and edification.

5. **Fulfillment in Christ**: The New Testament reveals how many Psalms find their ultimate fulfillment in the life, death, resurrection, and reign of Christ. This is particularly evident in passages like Hebrews, which often quotes Psalms to reinforce Christ’s superiority and the new covenant.

In summary, the New Testament encourages Christians to incorporate the Psalms into their worship, teaching, and personal devotion, while recognizing their fulfillment in Christ.
