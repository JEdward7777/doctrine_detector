  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a thorough and scripturally supported explanation of the concept of believers being considered priests in the New Testament. The student effectively references key passages and doctrines such as the priesthood of all believers, the role of Jesus as the High Priest, and the responsibility for believers to serve and minister to others. The answer could be improved by delving deeper into the significance of the priesthood in the Old Testament and how it relates to the priesthood of believers in the New Testament. Overall, a solid explanation with room for further depth."
