## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of believers being considered priests is rooted in the priesthood of all believers, a doctrine that emphasizes that all Christians have direct access to God and are called to serve Him and others without needing a traditional priestly mediator. This idea is significantly derived from several key passages:

1. **1 Peter 2:9** - This verse states, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." Here, Peter declares that all believers are part of a "royal priesthood," indicating their new identity in Christ and their calling to represent God and share His message.

2. **Revelation 1:6** and **Revelation 5:10** - These verses describe believers as being made "a kingdom and priests to our God," reinforcing the idea that all followers of Christ are given a priestly status.

3. **The priesthood of Jesus** - The New Testament emphasizes that Jesus is the ultimate High Priest (see Hebrews 4:14-16), who fulfills and surpasses the Old Testament priesthood. He opened the way for all believers to access God directly (Hebrews 10:19-22). 

4. **Ministry to others** - As priests, believers are called to serve one another and to engage in acts of worship and ministry (Romans 12:1). Every believer is responsible for offering their lives as living sacrifices to God, which is seen as a form of priestly duty.

5. **Spiritual gifts and service** - In the body of Christ, each believer is given spiritual gifts to serve others (1 Corinthians 12). This reflects the priestly calling to mediate God's grace and truth to the world.

In summary, being considered a priest means that every believer in Jesus is empowered to serve God directly, to worship, intercede, and minister to others. It signifies a new identity and responsibility, where all Christians can participate in the work of the Gospel and have a role in the spiritual community, reflecting Godâ€™s love and purposes in the world.
