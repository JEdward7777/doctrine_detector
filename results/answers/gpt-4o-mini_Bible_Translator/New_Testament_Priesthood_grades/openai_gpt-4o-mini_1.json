It effectively references key biblical passages and theological principles to support the understanding that every believer in Jesus is considered a priest with direct access to God and the ability to intercede for themselves and others. The response also emphasizes the role of believers in serving God and ministering to others, reflecting a deep understanding of the priesthood of all believers. Great job!"
