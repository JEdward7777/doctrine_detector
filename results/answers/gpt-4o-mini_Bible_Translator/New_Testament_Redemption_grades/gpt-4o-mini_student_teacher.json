  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of how the concept of purification evolves from the Old Testament to the New Testament. They have effectively highlighted the shift from external ritual practices to internal transformation through faith in Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit. However, the concern specifically emphasizes recognizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, which the student's answer does address but could have been emphasized more prominently throughout their response. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
