The explanation aligns well with the concern of recognizing Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of eternal purification. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly connect the detailed analysis presented with the specific concern provided, to ensure a more direct addressing of the Christian worldview perspective regarding the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice."
