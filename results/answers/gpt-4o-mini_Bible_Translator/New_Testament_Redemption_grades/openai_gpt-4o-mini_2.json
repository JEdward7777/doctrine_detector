It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus's ultimate sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin. The analysis and integration of relevant biblical passages demonstrate a solid understanding of purification within a Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the uniqueness and sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice in comparison to the Old Testament sacrificial system."
