  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned and insightful answer that effectively connects John the Baptist's lifestyle and behaviors with the Nazirite vow, showing a good understanding of the biblical continuity between the Old Testament practices and New Testament figures. Additionally, the student acknowledged the lack of explicit identification of John as a Nazirite in the New Testament, maintaining a balanced perspective. The answer could have been strengthened by directly citing the angel's announcement to Zechariah as the primary evidence suggesting John may have been a Nazirite, as indicated in the reference answer."
