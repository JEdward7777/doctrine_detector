The incorporation of Old Testament principles to understand the continuity between the Old and New Testaments is handled appropriately. However, it acknowledges varying interpretations among scholars, which is a valid concern when discussing nuanced theological topics. Overall, the response demonstrates a thoughtful analysis within a Christian worldview."
