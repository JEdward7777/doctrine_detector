## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The purpose of Noah's Ark, as described in the Bible, primarily served to preserve Noah, his family, and pairs of every kind of animal from the impending flood that God sent to cleanse the earth of its wickedness. The account is found in the Book of Genesis, particularly in chapters 6 through 9. 

God chose Noah because he was deemed righteous in his generation. The Ark was to be a vessel for survival and a means of starting anew after the floodwaters receded. Specifically, the purpose included:

1. **Preservation of Life**: The Ark was built to save Noah, his family, and representatives of every animal species from the judgment of the flood (Genesis 6:18-20).

2. **Judgment of Sin**: The flood represented God's judgment on a corrupt and violent world. The Ark symbolized both judgment and mercy, providing a means of salvation for the faithful (Genesis 6:5-7).

3. **Covenant Establishment**: After the flood, God established a new covenant with Noah, promising never to destroy the earth with a flood again, and signified this covenant with the rainbow (Genesis 9:12-17).

In summary, the Ark was a divine provision for preservation amid judgment, illustrating themes of salvation and covenant in the biblical narrative.
