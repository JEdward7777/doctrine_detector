It correctly highlights the preservation of life, the judgment of sin, and the establishment of a covenant with Noah as key aspects of the Ark's purpose. The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical account and effectively conveys the significance of the Ark within Christian theology. Great job!"
