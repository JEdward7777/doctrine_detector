  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough and well-supported explanation of how listening to God connects to becoming wise from a Christian worldview. The student effectively utilizes relevant Bible verses and examples to support their points. However, the response could be improved by emphasizing the importance of obedience to God in the process of gaining wisdom, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Encouraging the student to further integrate the element of obedience to God would strengthen their argument and align it more closely with the concern provided."
