  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of actions categorized as folly in the Bible with appropriate references. They demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of folly in alignment with God's will. The answer could have been strengthened by directly linking each example to the overarching idea that folly goes against God's will, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a strong understanding of the biblical perspective on folly."
