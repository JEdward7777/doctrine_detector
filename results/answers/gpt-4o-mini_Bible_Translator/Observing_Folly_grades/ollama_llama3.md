## [Answer](../Observing_Folly.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible outlines several actions and behaviors that are categorized as folly or foolishness. Here are some examples:

1. **Rejecting Wisdom**: Proverbs frequently speaks about the foolishness of rejecting wisdom and instruction. For instance, Proverbs 1:7 states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction."

2. **Pride and Arrogance**: Proverbs 16:18 warns that "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." A proud heart is often associated with folly.

3. **Hasty Speech**: Proverbs 29:20 highlights the folly of speaking without thought: "Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him."

4. **Indulgence in Sin**: Ecclesiastes 10:2-3 contrasts wise behavior with foolishness, stating, "A wise man's heart inclines him to the right, but a fool's heart to the left. Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool."

5. **Lack of Self-Control**: Proverbs 25:28 compares a person without self-control to a city broken into and left without walls, indicating a lack of protection and wisdom.

6. **Pursuing Temporal Pleasures**: In 1 Corinthians 3:19, Paul states, "For the wisdom of this world is folly with God." Pursuing worldly wisdom and pleasures instead of seeking God's wisdom is considered foolish.

7. **Ignoring God’s Commands**: In Psalm 14:1, it states, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'" Denying God's existence or ignoring His commandments is a central characteristic of folly in the Bible.

8. **Wasting Resources**: The parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) illustrates folly in the reckless spending of one's inheritance on frivolous living.

9. **Being Unteachable**: Proverbs 12:15 notes, "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice," indicating that a fool is often unteachable and self-reliant.

10. **Lack of Planning**: Proverbs 21:5 advises, "The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty." This demonstrates that impulsive actions without planning are considered foolish.

These examples reflect a broader biblical understanding of wisdom and folly, with an emphasis on living in accordance with God's principles and teachings.
