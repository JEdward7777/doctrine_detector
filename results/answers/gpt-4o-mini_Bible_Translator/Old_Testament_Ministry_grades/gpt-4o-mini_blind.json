  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive overview of the significant roles and responsibilities of the priests in the Old Testament. The student effectively covers key aspects such as the sacrificial system, ritual purity, the role of the high priest, maintenance of the temple, teaching and guidance, blessing the people, handling offerings and tithes, and duties based on courses. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the priestly ministry in the context of the Old Testament and accurately captures the essential duties performed by the priests. However, to enhance the response, the student could have included references to the priesthood lineage and the ordination process, as outlined in Exodus and Leviticus, to further enrich the explanation of how the priests carried out their ministry in the temple."
