The priests in the Old Testament played a pivotal role in the worship and religious practices of ancient Israel, primarily within the context of the tabernacle and later the temple. Their ministry was grounded in specific duties and regulations as outlined in the Law, particularly in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Here are some key aspects of how they carried out their ministry:

1. **Sacrificial System**: The priests were responsible for offering sacrifices on behalf of the people. This included burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings. Each type of sacrifice had specific guidelines about how it was to be conducted (Leviticus 1-7).

2. **Ritual Purity**: Priests had to maintain a high level of ritual purity. They followed specific dietary laws and avoided contact with anything deemed unclean (Leviticus 11; Leviticus 21:1-24). Before performing their duties, they often had to wash themselves and their garments.

3. **The Role of the High Priest**: The high priest held a special position among the priests, serving as the chief mediator between God and the people. He was the only one allowed to enter the Most Holy Place, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) to offer sacrifices for the sins of the people (Leviticus 16).

4. **Maintenance of the Temple/Tabernacle**: Priests were tasked with the care and maintenance of the tabernacle and later the temple. They ensured that the sacred items, such as the altar, lampstand, and showbread, were properly cared for (Exodus 27-30; 1 Chronicles 9:28).

5. **Teaching and Guidance**: The priests also played a key role in teaching the Law to the people. They were responsible for instructing Israel on God’s commands and how to live according to His will (Deuteronomy 33:10; Malachi 2:7).

6. **Blessing the People**: The priests would bless the people in the name of the Lord, utilizing specific blessings such as the Aaronic blessing found in Numbers 6:24-26.

7. **Handling of Offerings and Tithes**: The priests received offerings and tithes from the people as their livelihood, which were integral to their sustenance (Numbers 18:8-20).

8. **Duties Based on Courses**: In the temple period, the priests served in rotating courses or divisions (1 Chronicles 24), ensuring that there were always priests available to fulfill their responsibilities.

Through these practices, the priests facilitated the community’s relationship with God, ensuring that worship was done according to divine instruction and that the people's sins were atoned for through the sacrificial system. The priestly role was crucial in maintaining the spiritual health of Israel and the sanctity of worship.
