The answer effectively demonstrates how the practices of the Old Testament priests can inform current ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service within the Christian worldview. However, it could have further emphasized the importance of the priests' role in mediating between God and the people, and how their ministry ultimately pointed towards the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross."
