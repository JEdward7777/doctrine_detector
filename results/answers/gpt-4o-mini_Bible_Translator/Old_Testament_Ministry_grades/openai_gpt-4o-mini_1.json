It effectively demonstrates how the practices of the Old Testament priesthood can inform current ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service within a Christian worldview. The only improvement could be tying the practical functions of the priests to a deeper theological understanding or spiritual significance in light of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate High Priest."
