It effectively addresses the concern raised by emphasizing the shift from temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament to Christ's single, sufficient sacrifice for all sins forever in the New Testament. The inclusion of key scriptures, such as Hebrews 9-10 and references to substitutionary atonement, further strengthens the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
