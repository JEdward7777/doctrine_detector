The proposed strategies are well-reasoned and provide a comprehensive approach to conveying the uniqueness of the Christian God while respecting cultural sensitivities. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on how to address the concern of compromising biblical monotheism while emphasizing the uniqueness of the Trinity within the Christian faith."
