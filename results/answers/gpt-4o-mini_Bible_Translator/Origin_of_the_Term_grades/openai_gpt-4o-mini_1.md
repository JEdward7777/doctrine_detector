## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Jesus' followers were first called "Christians" in Antioch. This is mentioned in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, specifically in Acts 11:26, which states, "And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch, the disciples were first called Christians." This marks an important point in the early church as it signifies the identity of Jesus' followers as distinct from other groups at that time.
