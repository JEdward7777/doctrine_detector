  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful explanation on the concept of pardon in relation to God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ, supported by relevant biblical references. However, there was a slight deviation in the student's answer by delving deeper into the theological implications of pardon, which though informative, could have been simplified to align more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
