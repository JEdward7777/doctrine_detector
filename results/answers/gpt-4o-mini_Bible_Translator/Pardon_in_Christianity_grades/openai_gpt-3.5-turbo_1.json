It effectively explores the biblical basis, Jesus as the mediator, grace and faith, restoration of relationship, and the role of repentance in understanding pardon as it relates to divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ. The integration of relevant Bible verses and theological concepts demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on pardon and its connection to God's forgiveness."
