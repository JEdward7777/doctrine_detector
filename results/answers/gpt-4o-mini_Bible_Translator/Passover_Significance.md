## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
For Christians, the celebration of Passover holds significant theological meaning in relation to Jesus. Passover, originally a Jewish festival, commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, as described in the Book of Exodus. The key event involves the sacrifice of a lamb whose blood was smeared on the doorposts of the Jewish homes, protecting them from the final plague that struck Egyptâ€”the death of the firstborn.

In Christian theology, Jesus is often seen as the fulfillment of the Passover lamb. His crucifixion and sacrificial death are understood as the ultimate atonement for sin. Just as the blood of the Passover lamb saved the Israelites from death, Christians believe that Jesus' sacrifice offers salvation and eternal life to humanity. This connection is emphasized in the New Testament, particularly in passages like 1 Corinthians 5:7, which refers to Christ as our Passover lamb who has been sacrificed.

Furthermore, during the Last Supper, which was a Passover meal, Jesus instituted the Eucharist (or Communion) by breaking bread and sharing wine, symbolizing his body and blood. This act further solidifies the link between Passover and the new covenant established through Jesus' death and resurrection.

Thus, for Christians, Passover symbolizes not only the physical liberation of the Israelites but also the spiritual liberation from sin and death through Jesus Christ, embodying themes of sacrifice, redemption, and hope.
