  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of Passover in relation to Jesus from a Christian perspective. The student effectively connects the historical context of Passover with its foreshadowing of Jesus as the ultimate sacrificial lamb. The incorporation of relevant biblical references, such as 1 Corinthians 5:7, and the establishment of the Eucharist during the Last Supper further enhances the depth of the response. Overall, this answer provides a thorough and doctrinally correct explanation of the Christian view on Passover."
