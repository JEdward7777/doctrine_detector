  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response that effectively connects the Old Testament Passover with the New Testament revelation of Jesus. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the theological significance of Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb and how His sacrificial death relates to the atonement for sin and salvation for humanity. The inclusion of relevant biblical references and the significance of the Last Supper in establishing the connection between Passover and the new covenant is commendable. The student effectively conveyed the Christian worldview in understanding the symbolism and spiritual implications of Passover in relation to Jesus. A strong answer overall."
