It articulately conveys the theological significance of Jesus' sacrificial death and how it fulfills the symbolism of the Passover lamb in a Christian context. The incorporation of key biblical references and the element of the Last Supper in relation to the Passover meal adds depth to the explanation. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on the connection between Passover and Jesus."
