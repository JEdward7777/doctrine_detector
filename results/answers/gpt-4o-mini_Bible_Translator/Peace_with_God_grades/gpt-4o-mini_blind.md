## [Answer](../Peace_with_God.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Christian scripture, faith in Jesus Christ's sacrifice plays a vital role in achieving peace with God. Several key passages emphasize this theological truth:

1. **Justification by Faith**: Romans 5:1 states, "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." This verse highlights that faith in Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection is the means by which believers are justified or declared righteous before God, leading to peace.

2. **The Atonement**: Hebrews 9:26 explains that Jesus "has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself." His sacrifice is viewed as the atonement for sin, restoring the broken relationship between humanity and God.

3. **Reconciliation**: Colossians 1:20 indicates that through Jesus' blood shed on the cross, God reconciled "all things to himself." This reconciliation is necessary for establishing peace with God, which is possible only through faith in Jesus.

4. **The Role of Grace**: Ephesians 2:8-9 emphasizes, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God." It illustrates that salvation and the resultant peace with God are gifts received through faith, not earned by human effort.

5. **Assurance of Peace**: Philippians 4:7 describes the "peace of God, which surpasses all understanding," which guards the hearts and minds of those who trust in Him. This peace is a fruit of faith and a result of a deep relationship with God through Jesus.

In summary, scripture portrays faith in Jesus' sacrifice as the essential means for achieving peace with God. It affirms that through Jesus' atonement, believers are justified, reconciled, and granted access to a relationship that offers both peace and assurance.
