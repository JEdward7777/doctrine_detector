The use of relevant Bible verses supports the discussion well, and the inclusion of key principles such as justification, sanctification, confession, repentance, and the role of the Holy Spirit is commendable. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the process of purification from sin and its implications for the believer's relationship with God. Overall, a strong response reflecting a deep knowledge of Christian doctrine."
