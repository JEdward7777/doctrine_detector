While the answer goes beyond the reference answer in its depth and explanation, it effectively addresses the concern of understanding the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The student effectively connects the theological principles of purification from sin to its practical implications in a believer's life. Overall, this is a well-rounded and thoughtful response."
