It addresses the concern by highlighting the personal implications of purification on one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The response could be strengthened by including more specific examples or personal application of how this purification process manifests in daily life for a Christian. Nonetheless, the overall content is well-supported and aligns effectively with a Christian worldview."
