## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The expression "woe is me" conveys a deep sense of lamentation and recognition of one's own suffering, sin, or moral failure. It is an acknowledgment of personal anguish and often reflects an acute awareness of the severity of one's situation—be it a recognition of sin, impending judgment, or the weight of grief. 

This phrase is rooted in biblical literature, notably in the prophetic texts. For example, the prophet Isaiah uses it in Isaiah 6:5, where he expresses his unworthiness and the weight of his sin upon encountering the holiness of God. This recognition leads to a profound realization of one's need for repentance and transformation.

Overall, the expression implies a somber self-awareness and often a longing for divine mercy and redemption, highlighting the individual's understanding of their place in relation to God’s holiness and their own shortcomings.
