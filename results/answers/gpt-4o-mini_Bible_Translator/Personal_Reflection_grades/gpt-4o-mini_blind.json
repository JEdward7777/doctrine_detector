The student effectively connects the phrase to its origins in prophetic texts, specifically mentioning Isaiah 6:5. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of how the expression relates to personal anguish, recognition of sin, and the need for repentance. The inclusion of the longing for divine mercy and redemption adds depth to the interpretation. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful response, with a strong emphasis on doctrinal correctness."
