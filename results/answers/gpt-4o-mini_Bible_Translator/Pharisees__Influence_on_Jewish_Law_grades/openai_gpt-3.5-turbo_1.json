The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry due to the Pharisees' strict adherence to the letter of the law. The biblical references and theological insights support a Christian worldview perspective in evaluating the Pharisees' interactions with Jesus. Great job!"
