The points presented offer a solid foundation for understanding the term in its theological and relational context, emphasizing Jesus' divinity rather than physical lineage. The inclusion of analogies and references to church creeds enhances the depth and clarity of the response, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to teaching the concept effectively."
