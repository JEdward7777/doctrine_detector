To clarify the term "Son of God" for someone who may interpret it as indicating a physical offspring of God, it is important to highlight the theological and relational dimensions of the term as used in Christian Scripture. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Biblical Context**: In the Bible, the term "Son of God" is used in various ways. It reflects a unique and divine relationship between Jesus and God the Father, emphasizing His divine nature rather than suggesting a physical descent. For example, in John 1:1-14, Jesus is described as the Word, which was with God and was God, underscoring His eternal existence and divine status.

2. **Spiritual Meaning**: The title “Son of God” signifies Jesus’ divinity and His role within the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This doctrine conveys that Jesus is fully God and fully human, affirming His equality with the Father while also being distinctly a person within the Godhead. (John 10:30)

3. **Covenantal Relationship**: In the Old Testament, the term can refer to the nation of Israel (Exodus 4:22) or to kings and leaders (Psalm 2:7). These usages emphasize that being a "son" in the biblical sense often implies a special relationship, covenant, or role rather than a physical lineage.

4. **Incarnation**: The Christian belief in the incarnation—that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary—reinforces the idea that His sonship is unique. He is seen as both fully divine and fully human, which is fundamentally different from human parentage.

5. **Theological Interpretation**: Many church theologians, including the early church fathers, emphasized that the term indicates Jesus’ divine nature and role in salvation, not an implication of physical family ties. This theological framework has been developed over centuries of Christian teaching, promoting the understanding that ‘sonship’ is more about relationship and authority than biological generation.

6. **Clarification with Analogies**: You might consider using analogies to illustrate the relational aspect of being a "son." For example, a king may have many sons, but each son reflects the king's authority and character without being a product of physical attributes. 

7. **Explore Church Creeds**: Encourage exploration of historic creeds and confessions that articulate the understanding of the Trinity and the nature of Christ (e.g., the Nicene Creed), which can offer an established theological foundation for understanding the term "Son of God."

Encourage an open dialogue where questions can be asked, and emphasize that understanding this term takes time and study, often involving deep reflection on Scripture and tradition.
