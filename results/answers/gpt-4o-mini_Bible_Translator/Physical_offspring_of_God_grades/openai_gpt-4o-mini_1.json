  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and thorough explanation of the term \"Son of God\" in Christian theology, addressing the concern of preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology effectively. The biblical references, theological explanations, historical context, and practical teaching strategies all contribute to a robust defense of the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God. The only area for improvement could be to offer a more direct connection between the given answer and the additional insights presented, but overall, this response demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview."
