  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-reasoned explanation of the term \"Son of God\" within a Christian worldview, addressing the concern by emphasizing proper teaching to prevent doctrinal errors and retain biblical terminology. The biblical, theological, and historical perspectives presented are thorough and effectively communicate the key points needed to clarify the term for those who may misunderstand it. The use of scriptural references, theological concepts, analogies, and suggestions for further exploration demonstrate a strong command of the subject matter. Overall, this response is highly informative and aligns well with Christian teaching principles."
