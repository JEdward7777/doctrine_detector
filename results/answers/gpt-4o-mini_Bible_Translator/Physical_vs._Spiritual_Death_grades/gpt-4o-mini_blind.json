  "grade_comment": "Grade: 87\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a clear explanation of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' from a Christian perspective. They effectively reference relevant Bible verses to support their points and highlight the significance of these concepts in Christian theology. The answer could be enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications of spiritual death and perishing, as well as providing further examples from Scripture to strengthen their argument."
