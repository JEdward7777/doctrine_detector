  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-structured explanation of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' within a Christian worldview. They accurately discuss the biblical perspectives on these concepts and how they relate to believers' faith and eternal consequences. However, the student's response could have been strengthened by more directly aligning with the teacher's specific concern about expressing 'perish' in a spiritual context as highlighting eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus. Enhancing this alignment would have further solidified the clarity and accuracy of the response."
