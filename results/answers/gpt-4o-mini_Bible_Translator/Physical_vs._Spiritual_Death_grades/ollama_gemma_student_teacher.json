  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' within a Christian worldview. They provide clear definitions for both concepts and support their arguments with relevant biblical references. The student also acknowledges the temporary nature of physical death and the permanent consequences of spiritual perishing. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the connection between sin and spiritual perishing. Additionally, the student's conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the differentiation between physical and spiritual death to Christian beliefs about salvation and redemption."
