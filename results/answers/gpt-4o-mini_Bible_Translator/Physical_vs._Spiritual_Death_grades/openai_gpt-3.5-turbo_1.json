  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' within a Christian worldview. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the eternal consequences of 'perishing' in a spiritual context for those who do not trust in Jesus. The response is well-supported with biblical references and demonstrates a clear understanding of Christian theology."
