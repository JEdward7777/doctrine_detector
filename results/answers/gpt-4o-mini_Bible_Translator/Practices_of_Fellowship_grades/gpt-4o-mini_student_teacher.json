  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed answer outlining various practices through which early Christians expressed their fellowship. While the answer goes beyond the reference answer by providing additional examples and explanations, it effectively captures the essence of fellowship practices among early Christians. The inclusion of relevant biblical references enhances the depth of the response. However, the student could have connected the practices more explicitly to fostering deeper connections among contemporary Christians as the concern mentioned."
