The explanation effectively integrates the prophetic nature of the term with its historical context, showcasing how the concept of the Daughter of Zion reflects both the struggles and the hope for restoration in God's covenant relationship with His people. The response could benefit from a slightly more explicit connection to application in a contemporary context, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
