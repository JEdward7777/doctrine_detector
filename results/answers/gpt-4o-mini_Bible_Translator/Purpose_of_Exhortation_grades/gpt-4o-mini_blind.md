## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage, admonish, or instruct believers in their faith and conduct. Exhortation serves to build up the church and help individuals live in accordance with God’s will. It often involves urging believers to remain steadfast in their faith, to grow in spiritual maturity, and to live out their faith through love and good works.

Several key passages highlight this purpose:

1. **Hebrews 10:24-25** encourages believers to consider how to spur one another on toward love and good deeds, emphasizing the communal aspect of exhortation.

2. **2 Timothy 4:2** instructs Timothy to "preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction," showing that exhortation can encompass correction and encouragement.

3. **1 Thessalonians 5:11** states, "Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing," which directly addresses the purpose of mutual encouragement within the Christian community.

4. **Romans 12:8** speaks of the gift of exhortation, indicating that it is a specific spiritual gift meant to strengthen and support fellow believers.

In summary, the New Testament portrays exhortation as a vital tool for nurturing faith, fostering community, and guiding believers toward righteous living.
