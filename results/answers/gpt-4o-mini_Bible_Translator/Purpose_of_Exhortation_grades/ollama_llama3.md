## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage, admonish, or instruct believers in their faith and conduct. Exhortation serves to build up the church and help individuals live in accordance with God’s will. It often involves urging believers to remain steadfast in their faith, to grow in spiritual maturity, and to live out their faith through love and good works.

Several key passages highlight this purpose:

1. **Hebrews 10:24-25** encourages believers to consider how to spur one another on toward love and good deeds, emphasizing the communal aspect of exhortation.

2. **2 Timothy 4:2** instructs Timothy to "preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction," showing that exhortation can encompass correction and encouragement.

3. **1 Thessalonians 5:11** states, "Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing," which directly addresses the purpose of mutual encouragement within the Christian community.

4. **Romans 12:8** speaks of the gift of exhortation, indicating that it is a specific spiritual gift meant to strengthen and support fellow believers.

In summary, the New Testament portrays exhortation as a vital tool for nurturing faith, fostering community, and guiding believers toward righteous living.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately identifies the purpose of exhortation in the New Testament as being to encourage, admonish, or instruct believers in their faith and conduct, which aligns with the concern about understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. The use of specific passages from Hebrews, 2 Timothy, 1 Thessalonians, and Romans also provides strong support for this understanding.

The response could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern about biblical basis, as well as providing a more nuanced explanation of how exhortation serves to build up the church and help individuals live in accordance with God's will. Additionally, the response does not fully address the idea that exhortation can also involve persuasion or urging believers to avoid sin, which is mentioned in the original answer.

Overall, however, this response provides a strong foundation for understanding the purpose of exhortation in the New Testament and demonstrates a good grasp of biblical support for encouraging others in their faith journey.
