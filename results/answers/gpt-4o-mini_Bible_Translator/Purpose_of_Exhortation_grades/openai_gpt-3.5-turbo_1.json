  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a thorough explanation of the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. The references to key passages in the New Testament, such as Hebrews 10:24-25, 2 Timothy 4:2, 1 Thessalonians 5:11, and Romans 12:8, demonstrate a strong understanding of exhortation's role in nurturing faith and fostering community among believers. The response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the original answer and contrasting it with the Christian perspective on exhortation. Overall, well-done in incorporating biblical principles to support the purpose of exhortation."
