  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the biblical purpose of exhortation, aligning closely with Christian teachings on the subject. The integration of key Bible passages further demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. The only minor critique would be to perhaps include a direct reference to the importance of sin avoidance in exhortation, as this aspect is emphasized in Christian teachings as well. Overall, a strong and thorough analysis."
