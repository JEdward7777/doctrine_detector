  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-referenced answer to the question, covering various aspects of living a holy life as a Christian. However, the answer may be overly detailed and could potentially lose focus on the core elements of holiness outlined in the reference answer. While the student demonstrated a deep understanding of the topic, there could be more emphasis on the central idea of following God's commandments, bringing glory to Him, and being transformed by the Holy Spirit, as stated in the reference answer."
