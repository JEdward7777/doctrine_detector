  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of practical application of holiness in a believer's life, providing specific principles and practices that guide Christians in striving for holiness. The response accurately summarizes the biblical understanding of holiness as being set apart for God's purposes, involving both moral purity and dedication to God's service.\n\nThe list of 10 key principles provides a comprehensive overview of what it means to live a holy life, covering topics such as faith in Christ, engagement with Scripture, reliance on the Holy Spirit, and active participation in the Christian community. The inclusion of biblical references adds credibility and depth to the response.\n\nWhile the response could be strengthened by more explicit connections between the principles and the practical application of holiness, it generally does a good job of demonstrating how these principles can be lived out in everyday life.\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and biblically-grounded overview of what it means to live a holy life. With some further development of how these principles can be applied in practical ways, this could be an even stronger response."
