## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings was to convey deeper spiritual truths and moral lessons in a way that was relatable and accessible to his audience. Parables often used everyday situations and familiar imagery to illustrate complex theological ideas. This method served several purposes:

1. **Engagement**: Parables captured the attention of listeners, making them think critically about the meaning behind the story.

2. **Revelation and Concealment**: Jesus indicated that parables served both to reveal truths to those receptive to his message and to conceal them from those who were hardened in their hearts (Matthew 13:10-17). This dual purpose highlighted the condition of the listener’s heart and openness to God’s truth.

3. **Memorable Teaching**: The storytelling aspect of parables made them easier to remember, allowing the lessons to linger in the minds of the listeners.

4. **Inviting Reflection**: Parables encouraged personal reflection and self-examination. Listeners were often left to ponder the implications of the story for their own lives, leading to personal application of the lessons.

Overall, Jesus’ use of parables was a powerful teaching tool that invited listeners to engage more deeply with his message about the Kingdom of God, its values, and the nature of God’s love and grace.
