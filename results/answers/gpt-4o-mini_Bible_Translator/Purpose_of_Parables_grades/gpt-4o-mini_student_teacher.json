  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85/100\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings, touching upon key aspects such as engagement, revelation, concealment, memorable teaching, and inviting reflection. The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith. However, the student's answer could have more explicitly emphasized the aspect of concealing truth from those who did not believe, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher. By incorporating this point more prominently, the response would have aligned more closely with a Christian worldview perspective on the use of parables by Jesus."
