  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive understanding of Jesus' use of parables, discussing their purposes, including engagement, revelation and concealment, memorable teaching, and inviting reflection. The text also acknowledges the dual nature of Jesus' message, revealing truth to those receptive to his message while concealing it from those hardened in their hearts. This demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith.\n\nThe response is similar to the given answer in that both highlight the revelatory and concealment aspects of Jesus' use of parables. However, this response provides more detail and nuance, exploring the ways in which parables engaged listeners, encouraged reflection, and conveyed moral truths.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could provide even more specific examples from Jesus' teachings and the Bible to illustrate his use of parables. Additionally, it could explore the implications of Jesus' teaching methods for contemporary Christian witness and evangelism.\n\nComment: This is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' use of parables and their implications for faith. With some additional detail and examples, it has the potential to be even stronger."
