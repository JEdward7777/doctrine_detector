  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings, addressing the concern of understanding Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith from a Christian worldview. The response effectively highlights the engagement, revelation and concealment aspects, and memorable teaching nature of parables, supported by Biblical references (Matthew 13:10-17). The only suggestion for improvement would be to also emphasize the personal application and invitation to reflection aspect of parables a bit more directly in line with the concern provided. Overall, this is an excellent and well-rounded explanation."
