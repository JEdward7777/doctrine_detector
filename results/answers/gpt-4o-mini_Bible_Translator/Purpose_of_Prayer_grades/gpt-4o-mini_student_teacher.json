  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nWhile the student provided an extensive and well-explained list of the key purposes of prayer, incorporating various biblical references to support each point, the answer goes beyond the specified concern of recognizing the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life. The student's response delves deeply into the various dimensions of prayer, offering a comprehensive overview of its significance in a believer's relationship with God and within the church community.\n\nHowever, the reference concern primarily focused on specific aspects such as asking God for mercy and help, seeking wisdom, confessing sins, thanking and praising God, and interceding for others. While the student's answer includes these aspects, it also goes into greater depth on additional purposes of prayer. Thus, while the student's response is commendable in its thoroughness, it slightly overshoots the scope of the specified concern."
