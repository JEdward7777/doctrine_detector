## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of Christian teaching, the term 'Rabbi' is derived from the Hebrew word רַבִּי (rabbi), which means "my teacher" or "my master." It is a title of respect used for Jewish religious leaders and teachers, particularly those who are well-versed in the Torah and its interpretations.

In the New Testament, Jesus is often referred to as "Rabbi" by His disciples and others, highlighting His role as a teacher and spiritual leader. For example, in John 1:38, two of John the Baptist's disciples refer to Jesus as "Rabbi." This indicates that Jesus was recognized as a knowledgeable instructor of the Jewish law and traditions.

The term illustrates the authority and respect associated with teaching within the Jewish context during Jesus' time. In Christian theology, acknowledging Jesus as Rabbi emphasizes His role in conveying God's truth and guiding His followers in spiritual matters, grounding the Christian understanding of discipleship and learning in a model that values teaching and mentorship. 

Overall, in Christian teaching, the term 'Rabbi' encapsulates the respect for Jesus as a teacher and emphasizes the importance of His teachings in the foundation of Christian faith.
