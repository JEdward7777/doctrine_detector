It effectively addresses the concern regarding understanding redemption and its implications for salvation by delving into biblical passages, theological implications, and the broader significance of Jesus' sacrificial death. The response demonstrates a strong grasp of Christian doctrine and effectively connects the concept of ransom to themes of sacrifice, redemption, fulfillment of prophecy, and universal salvation. Great job in addressing the concern within a Christian worldview."
