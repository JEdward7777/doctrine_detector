The student demonstrates a sound grasp of the theological significance of these events and their impact on Christian doctrine. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to incorporate more scriptural references to support their points and strengthen the argument from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the spiritual implications of Jesus' rejection could have further enhanced the answer."
