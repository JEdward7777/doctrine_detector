It skillfully addresses the concern by exploring themes of authority, faith, and the recognition of the Messiah in Christian teachings. The Christian worldview is effectively applied to analyze the situation within the context of jealousy, fear of losing power, and the intertwining of earthly authority with divine missions. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of theological concepts and their significance for Christian beliefs."
