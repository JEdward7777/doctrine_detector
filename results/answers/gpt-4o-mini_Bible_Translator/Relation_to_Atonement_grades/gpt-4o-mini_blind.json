  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the terms \"propitiation\" and \"atonement\" in Christian theology. The student shows a strong understanding of the doctrinal significance of these concepts and effectively distinguishes between them. The biblical references and examples cited enhance the explanation. One suggestion for improvement could be providing a bit more depth on the Old Testament foundations of atonement to further enrich the discussion. Overall, this is a well-written and knowledgeable response."
