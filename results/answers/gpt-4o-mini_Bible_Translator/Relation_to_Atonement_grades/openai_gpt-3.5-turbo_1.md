The terms "propitiation" and "atonement" are closely related in Christian theology, but they have distinct meanings and implications.

**Atonement** refers to the process by which reconciliation between God and humanity is achieved. It is the act of making amends for sin, allowing for the restoration of a right relationship with God. The concept of atonement encompasses a range of biblical themes, including sacrifice, repentance, and forgiveness, and is often seen in the context of the sacrificial system found in the Old Testament, particularly in the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), which involved various sacrifices to atone for the sins of the people.

**Propitiation**, on the other hand, specifically refers to the appeasement or satisfaction of God's wrath against sin. This term emphasizes the relational dynamic between humanity and God, where God's holiness and justice necessitate a response to sin. Propitiation usually points to the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, viewed as an offering that turns away Godâ€™s wrath and satisfies His justice. 

In Christian theology, particularly in the New Testament, Christ's death on the cross is frequently described as a propitiation for the sins of humanity, fulfilling atonement for sin and restoring the relationship between God and people. For example, Romans 3:25 says that God "put forward Jesus as a propitiation by His blood," indicating that through His sacrifice, Jesus satisfied God's requirements for justice, thus enabling atonement.

In summary, while atonement encompasses the broader concept of reconciliation and restoration with God, propitiation focuses specifically on the aspect of satisfying God's justice and turning away His wrath through the redemptive work of Christ. The two concepts are interlinked, as propitiation is an essential part of the broader process of atonement.
