  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns with the Christian worldview on the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God. They have effectively referenced relevant Bible verses and provided insightful explanations. The only slight deduction is that the student could have reinforced the direct link between repentance and the avoidance of God's wrath even more explicitly, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and thorough response."
