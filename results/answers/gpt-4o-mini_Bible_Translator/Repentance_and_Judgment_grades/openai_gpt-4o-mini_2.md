## [Answer](../Repentance_and_Judgment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible presents a clear relationship between repentance and the wrath of God, emphasizing that repentance is essential for receiving God's mercy and avoiding His judgment.

1. **The Nature of God's Wrath**: In scripture, God's wrath is often depicted as a response to human sinfulness and rebellion. For example, Romans 1:18 states, "The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people." This indicates that God's anger is directed toward sin and moral corruption.

2. **The Call to Repentance**: The Bible frequently calls for repentance as a means to escape God's judgment. In Acts 17:30-31, Paul proclaims, “In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice.” This indicates that turning away from sin and towards God is a necessary response to His impending judgment.

3. **Examples of Repentance and Mercy**: The story of Nineveh in the book of Jonah illustrates this relationship clearly. When the people of Nineveh repented for their wickedness, God showed them mercy and relented from bringing destruction (Jonah 3:10). This demonstrates that genuine repentance can lead to the cancellation of God's wrath.

4. **The Role of Jesus**: In the New Testament, the message of repentance is central to the preaching of Jesus and the apostles. Jesus calls people to repent and believe in the gospel (Mark 1:15), offering forgiveness and reconciliation with God, which protects them from wrath (Romans 5:9).

5. **The Transformation through Repentance**: 2 Corinthians 7:10 describes the distinction between godly sorrow that leads to repentance and worldly sorrow. It states, “Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.” This emphasizes that true repentance is a transformative process that draws one closer to God's grace, rather than closer to His wrath.

In summary, the Bible teaches that God's wrath is a response to sin, while repentance is the means by which individuals can turn away from that sin and avoid the consequences of God's judgment. Through repentance, believers can find mercy and a restored relationship with God.
