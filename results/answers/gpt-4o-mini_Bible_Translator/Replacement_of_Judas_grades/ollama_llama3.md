## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This event is recorded in the Book of Acts, specifically in Acts 1:15-26, where the apostles cast lots to determine who would take Judas's place after his betrayal and subsequent death. Matthias was then numbered among the eleven apostles.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately records the event of Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, which shows an understanding of the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The mention of Acts 1:15-26 also demonstrates an effort to provide scriptural support for the claim.

However, the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation of the process by which Matthias was chosen. Additionally, it would benefit from a clearer connection between this event and the broader theme of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.
