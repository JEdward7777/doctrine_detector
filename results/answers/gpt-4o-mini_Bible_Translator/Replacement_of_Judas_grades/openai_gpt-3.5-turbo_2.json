  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer correctly states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and subsequent death, aligning with the biblical account in Acts 1. However, the concern about recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership is not directly addressed in the response, leading to a lower grade. A stronger connection between Matthias's selection and the broader concept of apostolic leadership would have improved the grade."
