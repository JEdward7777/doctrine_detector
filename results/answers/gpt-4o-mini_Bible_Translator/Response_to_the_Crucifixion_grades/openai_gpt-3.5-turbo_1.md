## [Answer](../Response_to_the_Crucifixion.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Acts 2:22-23, during his speech at Pentecost, the Apostle Peter addresses the crowd by affirming their role in the crucifixion of Jesus. He acknowledges that they, along with their religious leaders, handed Jesus over to be killed and crucified. Specifically, Peter points out that Jesus was "delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God," which highlights that while they played a part in the act of crucifixion, it was part of God's sovereign plan for redemption.

Peter's message emphasizes both the responsibility of the people in rejecting and crucifying Jesus and the greater divine purpose behind it. He calls them to repentance, emphasizing that despite their actions, there is forgiveness available through Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead. This dual acknowledgment of human accountability and divine sovereignty is a key theme in Peter's address.
