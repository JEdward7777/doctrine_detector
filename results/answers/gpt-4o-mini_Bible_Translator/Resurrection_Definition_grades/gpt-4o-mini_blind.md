## [Answer](../Resurrection_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In a Christian context, the term 'resurrection' primarily refers to the act of rising from the dead, particularly in relation to Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal life for believers. 

1. **Resurrection of Jesus Christ**: Central to Christian belief, the resurrection of Jesus is seen as the culmination of his redemptive work. Christians believe that after Jesus was crucified and died, he rose from the dead on the third day, which is celebrated on Easter Sunday. This event is viewed as a victory over sin and death, affirming Jesus as the Son of God and providing the basis for the hope of resurrection for all believers.

2. **Resurrection of Believers**: Christian doctrine teaches that at the end of times, there will be a general resurrection of the dead. Those who have died in Christ will be resurrected to eternal life, while others may face judgment. Key biblical passages regarding this belief include 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 and John 5:28-29. 

3. **Spiritual Resurrection**: Additionally, Christians believe in a spiritual resurrection that occurs when a person comes to faith in Christ. This is often referred to as being "born again" (John 3:3), where individuals experience a transformation and new life through their relationship with Jesus.

Overall, resurrection in Christianity encompasses the themes of hope, renewal, and divine victory over death, fundamental to Christian faith and doctrine.
