  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the term 'resurrection' in a Christian context, covering the resurrection of Jesus Christ, resurrection of believers, and spiritual resurrection. The student effectively connects these concepts to central Christian beliefs about life after death. The answer aligns well with the Christian worldview and captures the significance of resurrection within Christian doctrine. However, to align more closely with the reference answer, the student could have emphasized a bit more on the aspect of God's power in bringing someone back to life, as demonstrated through Jesus' resurrection."
