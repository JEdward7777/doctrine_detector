  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thorough analysis of Luke 6:37 and its implications for judging others within a Christian context. They effectively highlighted the importance of grace, humility, and forgiveness while engaging with the concept of condemnation. However, the student's answer could have been improved by focusing more on the core message of showing mercy and refraining from harsh judgment, similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
