  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 90.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough and well-structured answer that delves into the complexities of reconciling God's wrath with His loving and merciful nature. They have covered multiple key points, including the nature of God, holiness and justice, the role of love, redemptive purpose, hope in mercy, and an eschatological perspective. The answer is clear, coherent, and grounded in Biblical teaching.\n\nWhile the student's response goes beyond the given reference answer in terms of depth and breadth, they have successfully addressed the concern of how God's attributes coexist without contradiction in Biblical teaching. The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the theological implications surrounding God's wrath and His loving nature in a Christian worldview."
