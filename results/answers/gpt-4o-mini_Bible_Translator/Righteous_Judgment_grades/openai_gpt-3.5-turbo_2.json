It effectively ties in key theological concepts such as holiness, justice, love, and redemption to demonstrate the harmonious nature of God's attributes. The integration of relevant biblical references and the focus on the redemptive purpose of God's wrath further strengthen the argument presented. Overall, this response demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian theology in addressing the concern raised."
