  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a thorough and well-structured response that covers various ways angels serve God according to biblical references. The answer is supported by specific biblical examples and verses, showcasing a good understanding of the topic. However, to enhance the grade further, the student could have added more references to Old Testament examples of angelic interactions and could have delved deeper into the doctrinal implications of angelic roles, such as their connections to the hierarchy of Heaven and the significance of angelic worship. Overall, a strong response with room for slight improvement."
