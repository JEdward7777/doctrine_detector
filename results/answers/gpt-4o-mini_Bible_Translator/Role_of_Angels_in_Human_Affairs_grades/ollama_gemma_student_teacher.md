## [Answer](../Role_of_Angels_in_Human_Affairs.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Angels serve God in several significant ways according to biblical references:

1. **Messengers of God**: One of the primary roles of angels is to deliver messages from God to humans. This is evident in instances such as the angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus to Mary (Luke 1:26-38) and the angel speaking to Zechariah about the birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1:11-20).

2. **Ministers of God’s Will**: Angels carry out God’s will and execute His commands. Psalm 103:20 mentions that angels are mighty ones who do His bidding and obey His word. They carry out divine judgments (2 Kings 19:35) and act on behalf of God's plan.

3. **Worshipers of God**: Angels are depicted as beings who worship and glorify God. In Isaiah 6:1-3, seraphim are shown praising God with the words, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory." Similarly, the book of Revelation describes angels surrounding the throne of God in worship (Revelation 4:8).

4. **Protectors and Guardians**: Angels are often assigned to protect and guide God’s people. Psalm 91:11-12 speaks of God commanding His angels to guard His followers in all their ways. In Acts 12:7-11, an angel helps release Peter from prison.

5. **Witnesses and Executors of God’s Justice**: Angels maintain a role as witnesses in God’s creation and are involved in administering justice. For instance, they are said to participate in the final judgment (Matthew 13:39-41, Revelation 20:1).

6. **Encouragers and Comforters**: Angels can serve to encourage and comfort believers. In Luke 22:43, an angel appears to Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane to strengthen Him. 

7. **Servants to Believers**: Hebrews 1:14 indicates that angels are "ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation," indicating their role in assisting believers in their spiritual journey.

These roles illustrate the multifaceted ways in which angels serve God and His purposes, acting both in the spiritual realm and in the lives of individuals.
