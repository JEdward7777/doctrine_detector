It not only addresses the specific roles mentioned in the given answer but also expands on additional roles such as ministers of God's will, worshipers of God, executors of God's justice, and servants to believers. The understanding of these roles can indeed significantly impact how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives, as it highlights the intricate ways in which angels interact with and serve God and His people. Well done!"
