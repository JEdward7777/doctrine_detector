  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response effectively highlights the importance of community and teaching in the early church, citing specific examples from Acts to support its points. The author demonstrates a clear understanding of the apostles' actions and their relevance to modern Christian community. The response is well-organized, with clear transitions between sections, and uses biblical language to describe the apostles' practices.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have dug deeper into the specific ways in which teaching and community are intertwined, rather than simply stating that they are \"foundational\" for growth and unity. Nevertheless, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern of understanding community and teaching as modeled by the apostles.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the apostles' actions and their relevance to modern Christian community. The author's use of specific examples from Acts adds depth and credibility to the response. With some further development of the themes, this could be an exceptional response that effectively models Christian community and teaching."
