  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response, incorporating a variety of biblical references and aspects related to fulfilling roles within the Church. The answer effectively addresses the concern by highlighting key responsibilities of believers in their appointed tasks and service within the body of Christ. However, the response could be improved by focusing more directly on the main theme of faithfully fulfilling roles through service, the use of spiritual gifts, and advancing God's kingdom, as emphasized in the reference answer from the teacher."
