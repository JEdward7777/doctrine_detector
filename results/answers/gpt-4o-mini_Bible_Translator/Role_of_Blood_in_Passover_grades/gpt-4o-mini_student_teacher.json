  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-analyzed response to the significance of the blood in the Passover event within the Christian faith. They effectively connected the themes of redemption, sacrifice, and covenant from the Old Testament Passover to its fulfillment in Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The inclusion of scriptural references and theological explanations contributed to a thorough understanding of the topic. However, the teacher's reference answer focused on a specific aspect of the Passover event related to protection and deliverance, which the student did not directly address in their response. Therefore, a slightly lower grade is given for not directly addressing the concern raised in the reference answer."
