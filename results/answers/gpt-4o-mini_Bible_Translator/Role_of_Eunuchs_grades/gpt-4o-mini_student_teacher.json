  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained and insightful answer that effectively connects the role of eunuchs in ancient times to God's plan for individuals in society. They incorporated relevant biblical references to support their points and demonstrated a clear understanding of the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, irrespective of their physical or social status. The additional depth and analysis in the student's response led to a slightly higher grade than the reference answer provided by the teacher."
