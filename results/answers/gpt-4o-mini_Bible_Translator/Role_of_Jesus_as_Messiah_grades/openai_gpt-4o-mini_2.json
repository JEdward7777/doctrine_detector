It addresses the concern by highlighting Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy and his eternal rule over God's kingdom. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on Jesus' role in God's plan for humanity. However, minor improvements could include explicitly mentioning Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection as central to his role as the Messiah."
