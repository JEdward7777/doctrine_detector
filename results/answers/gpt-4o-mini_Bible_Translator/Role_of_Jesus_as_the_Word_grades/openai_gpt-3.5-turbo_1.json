  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and comprehensive explanation of the title \"the Word of God\" ascribed to Jesus within a Christian worldview. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' divinity and role in revealing God through various key aspects, such as his eternal preexistence, role as the ultimate revelation of God, and soteriological significance. The integration of biblical references from the Gospel of John further strengthens the argument. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on Jesus as the Word of God."
