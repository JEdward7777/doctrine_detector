# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, the Bible describes Jesus as central to salvation in several key ways:

1. **Messiah and Savior**: Jesus is recognized as the Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Verses like Isaiah 53 describe His role as the suffering servant who bears the sins of many. In the New Testament, this is affirmed in passages like John 3:16, which conveys that God sent His Son to save humanity.

2. **Atonement**: The concept of atonement is foundational. Jesus' death on the cross is seen as a sacrificial act that satisfies God's justice for sin. For instance, Romans 3:23-25 explains how all have sinned and fall short of God's glory, and that Jesus’ sacrifice serves as atonement through faith in His blood.

3. **Resurrection**: Jesus’ resurrection is crucial, as it signifies his victory over sin and death. Romans 6:4 teaches that just as Christ was raised from the dead, believers too are given new life. This resurrection is portrayed as pivotal for believers' hope of eternal life.

4. **Mediator**: Jesus acts as the mediator between God and humanity. 1 Timothy 2:5 states, "For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus." This emphasizes His unique position in reconciling humanity to God.

5. **Faith in Christ**: Salvation is received through faith in Jesus. Ephesians 2:8-9 articulates that it is by grace through faith that we are saved, not by our own works. This underscores the belief that it is Jesus’ work, not our own, that secures salvation.

6. **Lordship**: Accepting Jesus as Lord is essential for salvation. Romans 10:9-10 emphasizes that confessing Him as Lord and believing in His resurrection leads to salvation, highlighting the relationship between faith and obedience.

In summary, the Bible depicts Jesus as the promised Savior whose sacrificial death and resurrection provide the means for humanity's reconciliation with God. This relationship is accessed through faith, establishing Him as the cornerstone of salvation for believers.
