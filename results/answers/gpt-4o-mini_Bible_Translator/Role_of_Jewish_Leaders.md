## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The influence of Jewish religious leaders on the crucifixion of Jesus is a complex historical and theological issue, often understood through the accounts found in the New Testament, specifically in the Gospels. Here are some key points that outline their involvement:

1. **Concern for Authority**: Jewish religious leaders, including the Pharisees, Sadducees, and the ruling council known as the Sanhedrin, were concerned about Jesus' growing popularity and the challenge He posed to their religious authority and traditions. His teachings and actions, such as the cleansing of the Temple and claims about His identity, threatened their status and the established religious order.

2. **Accusations and Charges**: The Gospels depict that the religious leaders sought to find grounds to charge Jesus with blasphemy. They claimed that He was claiming to be the Son of God and making statements that violated Jewish law, which they interpreted as deserving of death. In the Gospel of Mark (14:61-64), for example, when Jesus affirms His identity as the Messiah, the high priest tears his clothes and accuses Him of blasphemy.

3. **Collaboration with Roman Authority**: Recognizing that they did not have the authority to execute anyone under Roman law, the Jewish leaders brought Jesus before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate. They manipulated the situation to frame Jesus as a political threat, claiming that He was claiming to be the "King of the Jews," which could provoke Roman intervention (Luke 23:2).

4. **Public Pressure**: The Gospels note that the religious leaders incited the crowd to demand Jesus' crucifixion. In Matthew 27:20, it is indicated that they persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas' release and to call for Jesus' execution.

5. **Betrayal by Judas**: One of Jesus' own disciples, Judas Iscariot, played a role by betraying Him to the Jewish leaders for thirty pieces of silver (Matthew 26:14-16). This act facilitated Jesus' arrest and the subsequent trial before the Sanhedrin.

6. **Trial and Sentencing**: The trial before the Sanhedrin was marked by irregularities and a lack of proper legal procedures. Jesus was tried at night, which was against Jewish law, and false witnesses were brought against Him (Matthew 26:59-60).

In summary, the Jewish religious leaders played a significant role in the events leading to the crucifixion of Jesus by seeking out charges against Him, manipulating the political situation to their advantage, inciting public opinion against Him, and collaborating with Roman authorities to achieve their goal of execution. This involvement is viewed within Christian theology as part of the broader narrative of salvation, where Jesus' suffering and death are seen as fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and serving as a sacrificial atonement for humanity.
