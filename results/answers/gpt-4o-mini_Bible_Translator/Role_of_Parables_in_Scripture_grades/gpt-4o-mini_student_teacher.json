  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and thorough explanation of how the prophet Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David, demonstrating a good understanding of the use of parables for correction and revelation in biblical narratives. The response effectively highlights the strategic and profound nature of Nathan's approach, leading to David's acknowledgment and repentance. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused directly on how the parable was used for correction and revelation, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
