The explanation of Nathan's strategic use of a parable to convict King David of his sin and lead him to repentance is clear and thorough. The response effectively connects the parable of the rich man and the poor man to David's own actions, emphasizing the role of storytelling in conveying deep truths. Overall, this answer reflects a solid grasp of the Christian worldview perspective on the use of parables for moral instruction and spiritual revelation."
