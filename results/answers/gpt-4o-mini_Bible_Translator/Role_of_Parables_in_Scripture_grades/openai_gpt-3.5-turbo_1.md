## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The prophet Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David in a very strategic and profound way. This incident is recorded in 2 Samuel 12:1-7. After David's adultery with Bathsheba and the orchestrated death of her husband Uriah, Nathan was sent by God to confront David about his sins.

Nathan approached David and told him a parable about two men in a cityâ€”one rich and one poor. The rich man had many flocks and herds, while the poor man had only one little ewe lamb that he cared for deeply. When a traveler came to the rich man, instead of taking from his own flocks, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the guest. David, upon hearing this parable, was incensed and declared that the rich man deserved to die and must repay the poor man fourfold for his wrongdoing.

Then Nathan revealed the true purpose of the parable by saying, "You are the man!" (2 Samuel 12:7). Through this method, Nathan was able to convict David of his sins without flatly accusing him at the onset. This approach allowed David to engage with the story emotionally and morally, leading him to a place of recognition and repentance when he understood that the rich man symbolized himself.

This use of a parable highlights Nathan's wisdom and the effectiveness of storytelling in conveying deep truths, ultimately leading to David's acknowledgment of his sin and his subsequent repentance, as expressed in Psalm 51.
