The roles of priests in sacrificial offerings, maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple, teaching the Law, performing rituals, interceding, blessing the people, and handling purification and cleansing duties are accurately described. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the priestly role in Israel's spiritual and communal life, reflecting a sound knowledge of biblical teachings. Great job!"
