## [Answer](../Role_of_Priests.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Old Testament, the main responsibilities of priests were outlined in several books, particularly Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. Here are the key responsibilities:

1. **Sacrificial Offerings**: Priests were responsible for conducting animal sacrifices and offerings on behalf of the people. This included burnt offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings (Leviticus 1-7). They ensured that these sacrifices were performed according to the established guidelines to maintain the holiness of the offerings and the worship.

2. **Maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple**: Priests oversaw the care and maintenance of the Tabernacle (and later the Temple), ensuring that it remained holy and suitable for worship (Exodus 25-30; 1 Chronicles 9:23).

3. **Teaching the Law**: Priests had the duty to instruct the people of Israel in the laws and commandments of God. They served as spiritual leaders and were responsible for ensuring that the community adhered to the covenant requirements (Deuteronomy 33:10; Leviticus 10:10-11).

4. **Performing Rituals**: They conducted various rituals necessary for worship, including the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) ceremonies, which involved making atonement for the sins of the people (Leviticus 16).

5. **Intercession**: Priests acted as intermediaries between God and the people. They prayed for the people, offered incense, and performed certain rites that sought God's favor (Exodus 30:7-8; Numbers 6:22-27).

6. **Blessing the People**: Priests pronounced blessings over the people, most notably the Aaronic blessing (Numbers 6:24-26), which reaffirmed Godâ€™s presence and favor in the lives of the Israelites.

7. **Purification and Cleansing**: Priests were also involved in the purification rites, determining the clean and unclean status of individuals and objects, and administering rituals for restoration and cleanliness (Leviticus 11-15).

These roles underscored the priests' significance in maintaining the spiritual and communal life of Israel, serving both God and the people in the context of their covenant relationship.
