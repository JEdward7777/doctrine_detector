It demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical role of priests within the context of the Old Testament. The only minor suggestion for improvement could be to explicitly mention the role of priests as intermediaries between God and the people, highlighting their crucial function in facilitating the relationship between God and His people through prayers and intercession."
