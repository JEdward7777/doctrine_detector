  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the biblical role of priests in the Old Testament, covering various aspects such as sacrificial offerings, maintenance of the Tabernacle/Temple, teaching the law, performing rituals, intercession, blessing the people, and purification/cleansing. The response effectively addressed the concern by accurately outlining the key responsibilities of priests based on biblical teachings. One minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the significance of priests as intermediaries between God and the people in the response."
