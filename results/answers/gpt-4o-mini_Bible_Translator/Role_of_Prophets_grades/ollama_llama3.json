  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately captures the main idea that prophets are spokespersons for God, conveying His messages to the people. It also highlights some key responsibilities of prophets, such as calling for repentance and intercession. The mention of forth-telling and fore-telling is also relevant, as it underscores the prophetic role in both proclaiming God's truth and predicting future events.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its exploration of the prophet's role. For instance, while it mentions calling for repentance, it doesn't delve deeper into the specific sins or idolatries that prophets were addressing. Similarly, the discussion of intercession is brief and could be expanded to show how this aspect of prophetic ministry was crucial in biblical history.\n\nOverall, I would say that this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical role of prophets, but could benefit from further development and depth in certain areas.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good grasp of the basics of prophetic ministry, but could be more detailed and nuanced in its exploration of the prophet's role."
