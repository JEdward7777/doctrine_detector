It elaborates on key responsibilities such as communication of God's message, calling for repentance, intercession, forth-telling and fore-telling, witness to God's character, and guidance for leadership. The biblical references strengthen the argument and showcase a deep understanding of the subject matter. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview perspective on the role of prophets in conveying God's messages and guiding His people. Great job!"
