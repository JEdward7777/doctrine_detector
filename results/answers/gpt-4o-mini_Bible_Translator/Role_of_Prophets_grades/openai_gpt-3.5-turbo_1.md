The primary role of a prophet in the Bible is to be a spokesperson for God. This involves several key responsibilities:

1. **Communication of God's Message**: Prophets are called to convey messages from God to the people. This can include warnings, encouragement, guidance, and revelations about future events (Isaiah 6:8-10, Jeremiah 1:4-10).

2. **Calling for Repentance**: Many prophets were sent to call the people back to God, urging them to repent from their sins and turn away from idolatry (Ezekiel 18:30, Jonah 3:4).

3. **Intercession**: Prophets often acted as intermediaries between God and the people, interceding on behalf of the nation or individuals (Exodus 32:11-14, Jeremiah 15:1).

4. **Forth-telling and Fore-telling**: Prophets both proclaimed God’s truth (forth-telling) and foretold future events as revealed by God (fore-telling), which is evident in many prophetic writings throughout the Old and New Testaments (Daniel 2:28-29, Revelation 1:1).

5. **Witness to God’s Character**: Prophets also serve to reveal God's nature and character, demonstrating His holiness, justice, mercy, and love (Micah 6:8, Habakkuk 2:14).

6. **Guidance for Leadership**: Prophets provided counsel to kings and leaders, helping guide them in making decisions that aligned with God’s will (2 Samuel 12:1-7).

Overall, the authority of a prophet comes from their direct communication with God, and their primary purpose is to direct the hearts and minds of God’s people toward Him.
