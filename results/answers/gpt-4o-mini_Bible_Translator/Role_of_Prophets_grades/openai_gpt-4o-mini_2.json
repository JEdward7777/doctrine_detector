It effectively addresses the concern by explaining in detail how prophets fulfill their role in delivering God's messages to the people and guiding them towards obedience. The biblical references are appropriately used to support the points made. However, the response could be strengthened by further emphasizing the importance of prophets as conduits of God's authority and highlighting the significance of their direct communication with God in conveying His messages."
