## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Sadducees were a significant religious and political group in ancient Judaism, particularly during the Second Temple period. Their main responsibilities in the Jewish Temple system included:

1. **Temple Administration**: The Sadducees were often associated with the priestly class and held significant positions within the Temple administration. They managed the rituals and the sacrificial system, overseeing the proper conduct of sacrifices and offerings.

2. **High Priesthood**: Many of the high priests, who played a crucial role in Temple worship, were members of the Sadducees. They were responsible for the most important rituals, particularly those during major festivals like Passover and Yom Kippur.

3. **Scriptural Interpretation and Legal Authority**: The Sadducees had their own interpretations of the Torah and played a role in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish council that made legal decisions based on Jewish law. However, unlike the Pharisees, they only accepted the written Torah (the first five books of the Bible) and rejected oral traditions.

4. **Maintaining Political Alliances**: As a group, the Sadducees were often in partnership with the ruling Roman authorities and sought to maintain stability within Judea. This political maneuvering sometimes translated into their influence over the Templeâ€™s operations and its financial affairs.

5. **Wealth and Economic Interests**: The Sadducees were often wealthy and had interests in the economic aspects of the Temple, including the trade that took place within it and the collection of temple taxes.

Throughout their history, the Sadducees had a strong influence on the religious and political landscape of Judaism, particularly until the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, after which their role diminished significantly.
