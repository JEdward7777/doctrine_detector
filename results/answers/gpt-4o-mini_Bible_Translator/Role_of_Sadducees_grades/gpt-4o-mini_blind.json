  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The response provides a solid overview of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish Temple system. It accurately describes their roles in Temple administration, high priesthood, scriptural interpretation, legal authority, maintaining political alliances, and their wealth and economic interests. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included more emphasis on the doctrinal differences between the Sadducees and other Jewish sects, particularly in relation to their beliefs about the afterlife and resurrection. Additionally, highlighting the Sadducees' rejection of certain key doctrinal beliefs, such as angels and spirits, would have further enriched the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
