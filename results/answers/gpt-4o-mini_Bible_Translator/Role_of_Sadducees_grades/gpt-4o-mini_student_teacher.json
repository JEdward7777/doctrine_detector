  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed answer outlining the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish Temple system during the time of Jesus. They have covered various aspects such as temple administration, high priesthood, scriptural interpretation, political alliances, and economic interests, which demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter. The historical context has been well explored and explained, providing a solid foundation for the student's response. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the specific concern of the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus more explicitly throughout the response. Overall, a strong and well-informed answer."
