  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish Temple system. It covers the essential aspects mentioned in the reference answer, including temple administration, priestly tasks, and political alliances. The inclusion of additional details about scriptural interpretation and economic interests adds depth to the response. However, the lack of elaboration on the Sadducees' influence on religious practices beyond their responsibilities in the Temple slightly diminishes the comprehensiveness of the answer."
