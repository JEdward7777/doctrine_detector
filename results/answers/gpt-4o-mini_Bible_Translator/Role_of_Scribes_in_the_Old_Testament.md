## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Scribes played a critical role in the preservation and transmission of the Old Testament scriptures throughout ancient Israel and the subsequent Jewish tradition. Their responsibilities included:

1. **Copying Texts**: Scribes meticulously copied the scriptures by hand. This process required great attention to detail to ensure that the texts were reproduced accurately, as any errors could alter the meaning of the scriptures.

2. **Teaching and Explaining the Law**: Scribes were often tasked with teaching the Law (Torah) to the people. They would interpret the scriptures and provide guidance on how to apply Godâ€™s laws in daily life.

3. **Standardizing Texts**: Over time, scribes worked to standardize the texts to unify the various versions and copies in circulation. This was important for maintaining a consistent understanding of the scriptures across different communities.

4. **Preserving Oral Traditions**: In addition to writing, scribes also preserved oral traditions that accompanied the texts, ensuring that the context and interpretations surrounding the scriptures were retained alongside them.

5. **Transcribing New Editions**: As new scrolls or versions were needed, or when older scrolls became worn, scribes would transcribe new copies, often from an authoritative or revered text.

6. **Maintaining Ritual Purity**: Scribes adhered to strict rituals and guidelines when copying scriptures to ensure that the process was sacred, often viewing their work as a form of worship.

7. **Providing Access to Scriptures**: They played a role in making the scriptures accessible to the public, especially in religious settings such as synagogues, where they would read and explain the scriptures to the community.

Through these responsibilities, scribes contributed to the ongoing life and vitality of the Old Testament scriptures, playing a significant role in their preservation for future generations. Their work is foundational to the transmission of the biblical texts that we have today.
