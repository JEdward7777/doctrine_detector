  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the role of witnesses in the New Testament, highlighting their importance in affirming Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. It also effectively connects the concept of witness to the call for Christians to share their personal experiences of God's work in their lives, which aligns with the concern.\n\nThe response is well-organized, using clear headings and concise language to present its points. The examples from Scripture are relevant and effectively illustrate the role of witnesses in the New Testament. Additionally, the response emphasizes the transformative impact that witnessing has on believers' lives, which reinforces the importance of personal testimony.\n\nTo improve this response, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the biblical accounts and the call to witness for contemporary Christians. For example, the response could explore how the apostles' experiences serve as a model for modern-day Christians seeking to share their faith with others. Overall, however, this is a strong response that effectively presents the role of witnesses in the New Testament and connects it to the concern."
