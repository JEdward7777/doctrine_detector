  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and detailed analysis of the role of witnesses in the New Testament, particularly focusing on the importance of firsthand accounts in affirming key events like Jesus' resurrection. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the imperative for Christians to witness to their faith and personal experiences. The content is well-supported with relevant biblical references and demonstrates a strong understanding of the role of witnesses in Christian belief. The only minor improvement could be to directly connect the response to the concern raised in the initial answer to further emphasize the importance of personal testimony in the Christian faith."
