## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The high priest in ancient Israel held a unique and elevated position compared to other priests, with several distinct responsibilities and roles:

1. **Intercessor**: The high priest acted as the primary intercessor between God and the people of Israel. He would represent the nation in rituals and on holy occasions, particularly on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), when he would enter the Holy of Holies to offer sacrifices for the sins of the people.

2. **Entering the Holy of Holies**: The high priest had the exclusive privilege of entering the Holy of Holies, the innermost chamber of the Tabernacle (and later the Temple), where the presence of God was believed to dwell. This was permitted only once a year on Yom Kippur, and specific rituals were required to ensure he entered and exited safely.

3. **Wearing Special Garments**: The high priest wore distinct and elaborate garments that symbolized his position and role. These included a breastplate with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, an ephod, a robe, a tunic, a mitre (headpiece), and a sash. These garments had significant symbolic meanings and served to visually represent the high priest's authority.

4. **Anointing and Consecration**: The high priest was anointed with sacred oil, setting him apart for his role and instilling in him a higher level of authority compared to regular priests. This anointing was a sign of his appointment and the divine choice of his service.

5. **Judicial Authority**: While other priests performed various duties in the service of the Tabernacle/Temple and offered sacrifices, the high priest had a significant role in decisions regarding legal and ritual matters, including purifications and disputes related to the Law.

6. **Maintaining the Cultic Life**: The high priest was responsible for overseeing the overall sacrificial system and ensuring the proper observance of worship practices. He held authority over other priests, giving him a leadership role in the spiritual life of Israel.

7. **Teaching and Guidance**: As a spiritual leader, the high priest also had a role in teaching the Law and guiding the people in their understanding of God's requirements.

These responsibilities underscored the high priest's essential role in the religious life of Israel, serving as a bridge between God and His people and embodying the themes of holiness, sacrifice, and intercession central to the Israelite faith.
