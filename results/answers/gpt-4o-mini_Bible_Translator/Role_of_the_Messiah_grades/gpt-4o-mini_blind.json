  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate overview of the roles the Messiah fulfills according to the Bible, integrating both Old and New Testament references. The explanation is well-supported with relevant scriptures and aligns well with Christian theology. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the divinity of Jesus as the Messiah, especially in relation to His roles as Savior and King. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
