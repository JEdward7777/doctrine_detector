## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Keeping the Sabbath holy is a central theme in the Fourth Commandment, as articulated in Exodus 20:8-11 and Deuteronomy 5:12-15. According to these passages, the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, designated as a day of rest and worship.

1. **Resting on the Sabbath**: The command to rest on the Sabbath signifies a cessation from regular work. Exodus 20:9 instructs, "Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God." This acknowledges the rhythm of work and rest, promoting physical and spiritual refreshment.

2. **Holy Convocation**: The Sabbath is not merely a day off; it is considered holy. This means it is set apart for worship and spiritual reflection. In Leviticus 23:3, it mentions gathering for sacred assemblies, highlighting the importance of communal worship.

3. **Reflection on God’s Creation and Rest**: The commandment references God’s rest on the seventh day after creating the world (Genesis 2:2-3). Keeping the Sabbath holy is an acknowledgment of God's creative work and His establishment of a rhythm in creation.

4. **Social Justice**: The Sabbath is inclusive; it extends to family members, servants, and even animals (Exodus 20:10). This reflects a broader principle of care for others and creation, promoting both rest and justice.

5. **Spiritual Significance**: For Christians, the Sabbath has also been understood in the context of Jesus' resurrection and the establishment of Sunday as a day of worship. This transition emphasizes the new creation and the fulfillment of the law through Christ. 

In summary, keeping the Sabbath holy involves resting from labor, honoring God through worship, reflecting on creation, promoting justice and care for others, and recognizing the spiritual significance of the day in the life of faith.
