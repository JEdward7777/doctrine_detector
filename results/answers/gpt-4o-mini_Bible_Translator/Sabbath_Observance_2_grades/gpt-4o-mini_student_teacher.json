  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how God instructed the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath, demonstrating a good understanding of the biblical account in Exodus 16. They emphasized the importance of observing the Sabbath as a day of rest and highlighted the significance of God's provision in relation to keeping the Sabbath holy. However, the student's response could have been more concise and focused directly on the specific instruction of gathering a double portion before the Sabbath, as mentioned in the reference answer."
