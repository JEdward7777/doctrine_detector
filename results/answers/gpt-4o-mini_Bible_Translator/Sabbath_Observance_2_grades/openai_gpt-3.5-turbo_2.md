## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the biblical account found in Exodus 16, God instructed the Israelites on how to gather manna, especially in relation to the Sabbath. The Israelites were to collect manna each morning during the six days of the week, gathering only enough for their daily needs. However, on the sixth day, they were commanded to gather a double portion, enough for two days. This was to ensure that they would have enough to eat on the Sabbath, which was a day of rest.

In Exodus 16:22-30, it states that the Israelites gathered a double portion on the sixth day, and then Moses told them that they would not find manna on the Sabbath (the seventh day). God rested on the seventh day after creation, and He commanded the Israelites to do the same, emphasizing the importance of keeping the Sabbath holy.

The instruction was a clear indication that the Sabbath was to be a day of rest, free from work, including the gathering of food. This guidance reinforced the significance of the Sabbath in the life of the Israelite community and their dependence on God's provision.
