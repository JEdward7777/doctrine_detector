  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90.\n\nThe answer provided a clear and accurate explanation of the timing of the Sabbath according to Jewish tradition. It correctly referenced the biblical basis for observing the Sabbath from sunset to sunset, as well as the practice of using prayer books or guides to determine specific times. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and presented the information in a coherent manner. The only potential area for improvement could be adding additional biblical references or theological insights that further support the timing of the Sabbath in Jewish tradition."
