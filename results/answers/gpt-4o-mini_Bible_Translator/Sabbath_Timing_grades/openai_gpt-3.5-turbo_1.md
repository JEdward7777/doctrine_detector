## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath (Shabbat) begins at sunset on Friday evening and lasts until sunset on Saturday evening. This timing is based on the biblical account of creation found in Genesis 1, where it states, "And there was evening, and there was morningâ€”the first day" (Genesis 1:5). 

As a result, the Jewish day is counted from evening to evening, rather than from midnight to midnight as in the Gregorian calendar. The exact times for the beginning and end of Shabbat can vary depending on geographical location and the time of year, as they are determined by the time of sunset. Observant Jews often use a set of prayer books or guides, known as a "calendar" or "zmanim," to determine the specific times for their locality.
