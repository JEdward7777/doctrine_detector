## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Loving others sacrificially, as demonstrated by Jesus, involves putting the needs and well-being of others above our own, often at a personal cost. This concept is rooted in several key Christian teachings and examples from the life of Jesus.

1. **Selflessness**: Sacrificial love means prioritizing others' needs, desiring their good even if it requires us to sacrifice our comfort, time, resources, or even our lives. Jesus exemplified this through His willingness to suffer and die on the cross for humanity's sins (John 15:13).

2. **Unconditional Love**: Jesus taught His followers to love not just their friends or those who love them back, but also their enemies (Matthew 5:44). This reflects a love that does not depend on reciprocation, but is given freely.

3. **Service**: Jesus modeled sacrificial love through acts of service, such as washing His disciples' feet (John 13:1-17). This act demonstrated humility and the importance of serving others, regardless of one’s social status.

4. **Compassion**: Throughout His ministry, Jesus showed deep compassion for the marginalized, the sick, and the suffering (Matthew 9:36). His love was active, as He healed the sick, fed the hungry, and comforted the brokenhearted.

5. **Forgiveness**: Jesus extends grace and forgiveness freely, even to those who wronged Him (Luke 23:34). He demonstrated that loving others sacrificially includes forgiving others, which can be one of the hardest sacrifices to make.

6. **Commitment**: Sacrificial love is steadfast and committed. It perseveres through difficulties and challenges, reflecting God's unwavering love for humanity.

In essence, to love sacrificially as Jesus did is to embody a love that is self-giving, compassionate, and unconditional. It calls Christians to act out of love, even when it requires personal sacrifice, following the example set by Christ. This is central to Christian faith and reflects the transformative power of God’s love in the lives of believers.
