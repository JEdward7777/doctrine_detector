# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Sadducees, a Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, held a belief system that did not include the resurrection of the dead. They based their religious views primarily on the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) and rejected teachings that were derived from the later prophetic writings and oral traditions. As a result, they denied the existence of an afterlife, the resurrection, and the concept of angels and spirits.

In contrast, Christian teaching encompasses a robust belief in the resurrectionâ€”primarily the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is foundational to Christian faith. Christians believe that Jesus' resurrection guarantees the future resurrection of all believers. This belief is rooted in passages such as 1 Corinthians 15, where the Apostle Paul explains the significance of Christ's resurrection and the future hope of believers being raised similarly.

Thus, the key contrast lies in the Sadducees' denial of resurrection and the afterlife, as opposed to the Christian affirmation of both, grounded in the resurrection of Jesus and the promise of eternal life for believers.
