It effectively contrasts the Sadducees' denial of resurrection with the Christian affirmation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the promise of resurrection for believers. The Christian worldview is well-represented in emphasizing the foundational importance of Christ's resurrection and the hope it offers to believers."
