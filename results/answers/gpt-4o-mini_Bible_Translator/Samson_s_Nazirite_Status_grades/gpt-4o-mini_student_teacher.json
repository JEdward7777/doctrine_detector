  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive analysis of Samson's story in relation to the Nazirite vow, touching on important aspects such as divine calling, strength, consequences of disobedience, sin and redemption, and cultural reflections. The student effectively explores the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. However, the response could benefit from more focus on how Samson's strength was directly linked to his adherence to the Nazirite vow, especially the prohibition against cutting his hair, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Emphasizing this direct connection would have strengthened the student's analysis and alignment with the concern provided."
