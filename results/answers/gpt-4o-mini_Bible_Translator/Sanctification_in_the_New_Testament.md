## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The New Testament describes the sanctification process for believers in Jesus as an essential aspect of the Christian life. Sanctification refers to the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer that leads to spiritual growth and moral transformation, resulting in a life that reflects the character of Christ.

1. **Positional Sanctification**: According to 1 Corinthians 1:2 and Hebrews 10:10, believers are sanctified positionally at the moment of salvation. This means that through faith in Jesus Christ, they are set apart for God and seen as holy in His sight. This sanctification is accomplished through the sacrifice of Jesus.

2. **Progressive Sanctification**: The New Testament emphasizes that sanctification is an ongoing process. Passages such as Philippians 2:12-13 encourage believers to "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling," highlighting individual responsibility in the sanctification journey. At the same time, it acknowledges that it is God who works in them to will and to act according to His good purpose.

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit**: The Holy Spirit plays a central role in sanctification (Romans 8:4). Believers are called to be led by the Spirit (Galatians 5:16), which enables them to overcome sin and produce the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).

4. **Moral Transformation**: The process of sanctification is marked by a transformation in behavior and attitudes. Romans 12:1-2 urges believers to present their bodies as living sacrifices and to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. This reflects the idea of being conformed to the image of Christ (Romans 8:29).

5. **Community and Accountability**: The New Testament also underscores the importance of the Christian community in the sanctification process. Believers are called to encourage one another (Hebrews 10:24-25), bear one anotherâ€™s burdens (Galatians 6:2), and hold each other accountable (James 5:16).

6. **Ultimate Sanctification**: Finally, the New Testament speaks of the ultimate completion of sanctification, which will occur when believers are glorified in the presence of God (1 John 3:2). This will be a time when believers are fully and finally freed from sin and reflect Christ perfectly.

In summary, the New Testament portrays sanctification as both a definitive act at conversion and a lifelong journey characterized by growth in holiness through the work of the Holy Spirit, the influence of Scripture, the support of the Christian community, and the ultimate hope of future glory with Christ.
