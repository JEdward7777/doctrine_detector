## [Answer](../Sanctuary_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of the Bible, the term "sanctuary" generally refers to a sacred or holy place where the presence of God is experienced, worship occurs, and spiritual activities are carried out. 

1. **Tabernacle and Temple**: The most significant examples of sanctuaries in the Old Testament are the Tabernacle, which was a portable dwelling place for God's presence during the Israelites' desert wanderings (Exodus 25-27), and later, the Temple built by Solomon in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6). These structures served as places for worship, sacrifices, and the meeting of God with His people.

2. **Holy Places**: The word "sanctuary" can also refer to specific areas within these structures, such as the Holy of Holies, the innermost chamber where the presence of God dwelled, accessible only by the high priest on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16).

3. **Spiritual Significance**: Beyond physical locations, "sanctuary" can also metaphorically represent the concept of spiritual refuge and safety found in God. For example, Psalm 91 speaks of God as a refuge and fortress, highlighting a place of safety for those who trust in Him.

4. **Church Context**: In contemporary Christianity, the term may also refer to church buildings or spaces dedicated to worship, signifying a place set apart for encountering God, prayer, and community among believers.

Overall, in biblical usage, a sanctuary is both a physical space dedicated to divine worship and a symbol of divine protection and presence among God's people.
