It acknowledges the physical locations like the Tabernacle and Temple, the significance of holy places within these structures, and also emphasizes the spiritual refuge and safety found in God. The inclusion of both Old Testament examples and the contemporary Christian context demonstrates a well-rounded understanding of the term. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how the concept of sanctuary ties into the overall narrative of redemption and relationship with God in the Bible."
