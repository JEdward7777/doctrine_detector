The inclusion of examples and references from the Old Testament, along with the connection to contemporary Christian contexts, demonstrates a strong understanding of the term. The response effectively addresses the concern by thoroughly exploring the meaning and significance of \"sanctuary\" in relation to God's presence, worship, and spiritual safety. Well done!"
