In the Old Testament, God described the sanctuary as a sacred place where His presence dwelled among His people, the Israelites. The sanctuary, often referred to as the Tabernacle before the construction of the Temple, was designed as a dwelling place for God among His people. 

In Exodus 25:8, God commands, "And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst." This indicates God's desire to be close to His people, to have a relationship with them, and to provide a space for worship and sacrifice. The design of the sanctuary, with its specific materials and furnishings, was given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25-31), emphasizing its importance and the holiness required to approach God.

The sanctuary served several purposes:

1. **Presence of God**: It represented God's presence (Shekinah) among His people. The Ark of the Covenant, located in the Most Holy Place, was seen as the throne of God on earth.

2. **Worship and Sacrifice**: It was the central location for the Israelites to offer sacrifices, conduct worship, and seek atonement for sin, as laid out in the Levitical laws.

3. **Covenant Relationship**: The sanctuary was a physical representation of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Through the rituals conducted there, the people expressed their commitment to God and His laws.

4. **Access to God**: Although the sanctuary was reserved for the priests and particularly the High Priest during specific times, it symbolized the way God provided access to Himself, highlighting both His holiness and the need for atonement.

In summary, the sanctuary was a vital aspect of the religious life of the Israelites, symbolizing God's desire for intimacy with His people and the means by which they could interact with Him through worship and sacrifice.
