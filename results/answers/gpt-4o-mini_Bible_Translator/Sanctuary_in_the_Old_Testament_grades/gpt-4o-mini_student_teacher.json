  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that captures the significance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God among His people in the Old Testament. The student effectively highlighted the multiple purposes of the sanctuary, its role in representing God's presence, and the importance of worship and sacrifice. The answer aligns closely with the given reference answer, but it could have directly quoted the specific description of the sanctuary as a safe place for God's people to enhance accuracy and alignment with the concern."
