  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the sanctuary in the Old Testament context, highlighting its significance as a sacred space where God's presence dwelled among His people and emphasizing the sanctuary's roles in worship, sacrifice, and the covenant relationship with God. However, while it successfully addresses the importance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God among His people, the mention of the sanctuary as a safe place for protection is not explicitly discussed in the provided response, which slightly detracts from the alignment with the concern."
