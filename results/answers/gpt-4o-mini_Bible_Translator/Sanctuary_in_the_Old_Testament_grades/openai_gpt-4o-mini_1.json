It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the sanctuary's importance as a source of safety and protection for the Israelites, in addition to being a place of divine presence. The theological insights align well with a Christian worldview, showcasing God's desire for intimacy with His people and the provision of safety through the sanctuary. Great job!"
