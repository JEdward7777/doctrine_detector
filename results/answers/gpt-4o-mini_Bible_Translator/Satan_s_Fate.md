## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible describes the fate of Satan and his followers in several passages, primarily in the New Testament. According to Christian theology, Satan and his followers, often referred to as demons, will ultimately face judgment and eternal punishment.

1. **Revelation 20:10** states, "And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever." This verse emphasizes the eternal nature of the punishment that Satan will face.

2. In **Matthew 25:41**, Jesus speaks of the final judgment, saying, "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'" This indicates that hell was originally prepared for Satan and his followers.

3. **2 Peter 2:4** reinforces this idea by stating, "For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment." This reflects the belief that sinful angels (often identified with demons) are already facing judgment.

4. **Jude 1:6** also mentions that "the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day." 

In summary, biblical content affirms that Satan and his followers will ultimately be cast into hell, where they will face eternal punishment and torment. This judgment is a core understanding in Christian eschatology regarding the fate of evil.
