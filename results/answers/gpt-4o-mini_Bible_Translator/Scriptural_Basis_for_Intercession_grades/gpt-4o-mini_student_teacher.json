  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses related to intercessory prayer, showcasing a deep understanding of the topic. However, they missed some key verses referenced in the teacher's answer, which could have enhanced the response. It is encouraging to see the student actively engaging with Scripture on the practice of interceding for others."
