  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of propitiation and cited relevant Bible verses to support their explanation. However, they included Hebrews 2:17 in their list of verses, which does not specifically mention propitiation. It is important to ensure accuracy in selecting verses that directly connect to the theological concept being discussed. Thus, a slightly lower grade is assigned due to this inaccuracy."
