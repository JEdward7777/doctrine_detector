  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response provides several key verses that explicitly convey the concept of propitiation, including Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Hebrews 2:17. These verses are all relevant to the theological concept of propitiation and provide a clear explanation of Jesus' role as the means by which God's judgment against sin is appeased.\n\nThe response also effectively connects the theological concept with biblical references, providing context for each verse and highlighting Jesus as the propitiation for our sins. This demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concept and its application to Scripture.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more depth or analysis of the verses, rather than simply listing them. Additionally, some explanation of how these verses contribute to a deeper understanding of the concept of propitiation could enhance the response. Nevertheless, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a strong connection between theological concepts and biblical references."
