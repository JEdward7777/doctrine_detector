## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of propitiation refers to the act of appeasing or satisfying the wrath of God, particularly in relation to sin and the need for atonement. Several Bible verses explicitly convey this concept:

1. **Romans 3:25** - "Whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins."

2. **1 John 2:2** - "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world."

3. **1 John 4:10** - "In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins."

4. **Hebrews 2:17** - "Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."

These verses affirm the belief that Jesus Christ's sacrificial death serves as the means of appeasing God’s judgment against sin, thus restoring the relationship between God and humanity for those who believe.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response provides several key verses that explicitly convey the concept of propitiation, including Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Hebrews 2:17. These verses are all relevant to the theological concept of propitiation and provide a clear explanation of Jesus' role as the means by which God's judgment against sin is appeased.

The response also effectively connects the theological concept with biblical references, providing context for each verse and highlighting Jesus as the propitiation for our sins. This demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concept and its application to Scripture.

The only area for improvement would be to provide more depth or analysis of the verses, rather than simply listing them. Additionally, some explanation of how these verses contribute to a deeper understanding of the concept of propitiation could enhance the response. Nevertheless, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a strong connection between theological concepts and biblical references.
