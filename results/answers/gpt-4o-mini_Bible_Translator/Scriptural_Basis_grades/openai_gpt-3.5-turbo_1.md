The concept of propitiation refers to the act of appeasing or satisfying the wrath of God, particularly in relation to sin and the need for atonement. Several Bible verses explicitly convey this concept:

1. **Romans 3:25** - "Whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins."

2. **1 John 2:2** - "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world."

3. **1 John 4:10** - "In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins."

4. **Hebrews 2:17** - "Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."

These verses affirm the belief that Jesus Christ's sacrificial death serves as the means of appeasing God’s judgment against sin, thus restoring the relationship between God and humanity for those who believe.
