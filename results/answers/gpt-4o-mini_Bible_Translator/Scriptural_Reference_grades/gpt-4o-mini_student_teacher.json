  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of various biblical passages addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers, emphasizing the distinction between believers and the secular world. They effectively highlighted the tension believers face in navigating life in a world characterized by ungodly values. However, the student could have incorporated the reference answer from the teacher to enhance their response and further solidify the integration of the concept within a Christian worldview."
