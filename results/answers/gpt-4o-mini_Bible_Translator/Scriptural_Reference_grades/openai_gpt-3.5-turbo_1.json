  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of key biblical passages that directly address how believers should view and interact with the world characterized by ungodly values. It effectively brings in relevant scriptures such as John 15:18-19, Romans 12:2, 1 John 2:15-17, James 4:4, Philippians 3:20, and John 17:14-16 to illustrate the tension between the values of the secular world and those of the kingdom of God. By including these passages, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of how to navigate life as a believer in a world with ungodly values from a Christian worldview."
