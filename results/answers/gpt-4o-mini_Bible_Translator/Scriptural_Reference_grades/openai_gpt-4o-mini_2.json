  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation supported by multiple relevant biblical passages addressing the concept of believers navigating life in a world characterized by ungodly values. The passage choices are well-suited to the concern presented, and the overall analysis reflects a deep understanding of the Christian worldview on this issue. The use of additional passages beyond those mentioned in the student's response enhances the richness of the explanation. Great job!"
