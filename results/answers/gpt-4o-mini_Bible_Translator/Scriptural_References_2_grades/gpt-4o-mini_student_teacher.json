  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer citing relevant biblical passages that explicitly address the concept of the Day of Judgment. Although the student's response included additional verses beyond the teacher's reference, the verses provided aligned well with the concern to deepen understanding of scripture related to judgment. The student demonstrated a solid grasp of the topic and effectively reinforced the scriptural basis for beliefs in the Day of Judgment. Great effort overall."
