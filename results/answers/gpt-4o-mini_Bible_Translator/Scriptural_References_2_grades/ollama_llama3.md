## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of the Day of Judgment is found throughout the Bible, and several passages explicitly address this important theological theme. Here are some key verses that support the idea of a final judgment:

1. **Matthew 25:31-46** - In this passage, Jesus describes the scene of the final judgment where He separates the righteous from the wicked, often referred to as the Sheep and the Goats.

2. **2 Corinthians 5:10** - This verse states, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil."

3. **Revelation 20:11-15** - This passage describes the Great White Throne Judgment, where the dead are judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.

4. **Romans 14:10-12** - Paul reminds believers that "we will all stand before the judgment seat of God," indicating that everyone will give an account of themselves to God.

5. **Matthew 12:36-37** - Jesus teaches that people will give an account for every careless word they speak, emphasizing the seriousness of the judgment.

6. **Acts 17:30-31** - In this passage, Paul declares that God has set a day for judging the world in righteousness, confirming the certainty of the impending judgment.

7. **Hebrews 9:27** - This verse notes, "And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment," highlighting the inevitability of judgment after death.

These passages collectively illustrate the Christian teaching that all individuals will face a Day of Judgment, where their lives and choices will be evaluated in light of God's righteousness.

Comment:

The response provided exceeds expectations in terms of providing relevant biblical passages that support the concept of the Day of Judgment. The inclusion of multiple references from different books and accounts, such as Matthew, Corinthians, Revelation, Romans, and Hebrews, demonstrates a strong understanding of scripture.

However, the original answer focused on Luke 10:12, Luke 11:31, Luke 11:32, Matthew 10:15, and Matthew 12:36. While these passages may touch on themes related to judgment, they do not explicitly address the Day of Judgment as comprehensively as the provided response.

To reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs, it is essential to provide a more detailed explanation of how these specific passages relate to the concept of the Day of Judgment and its significance in Christian theology. Nevertheless, the provided response demonstrates a solid grasp of biblical teachings on this subject.
