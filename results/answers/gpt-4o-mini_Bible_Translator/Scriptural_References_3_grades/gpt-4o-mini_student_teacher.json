  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of the passage in Matthew 23:27-28, drawing out important insights about the nature of iniquity. They effectively highlighted the themes of external vs. internal reality, hypocrisy, spiritual death, and lawlessness present in the passage. Additionally, the student connected these insights to the importance of self-examination and authentic relationship with God. However, the response could have been more concise and directly related to the specified concern, which the teacher's reference answer effectively accomplished."
