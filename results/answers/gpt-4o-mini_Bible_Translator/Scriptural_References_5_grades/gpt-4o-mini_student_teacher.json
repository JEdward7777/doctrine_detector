  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-argued response by citing multiple relevant passages that demonstrate the shift in understanding of Hades in the New Testament. They effectively connected these passages to the theme of judgment and the association of Hades with the unrighteous. Additionally, the student's answer showed a good understanding of the development of the concept of Hades within Christian eschatology. The grade is slightly reduced from 100 as the student could have made a clearer distinction between the concept of Hades being more specifically associated with the unrighteous, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
