## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_5.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The New Testament presents a nuanced understanding of Hades that reflects a shift from a more neutral view to one that incorporates ideas associated with judgment and the unrighteous. Here are several key passages that demonstrate this progression:

1. **Luke 16:19-31** - In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Hades is depicted as a place where the rich man, after death, experiences torment and separation from Abraham, who is in a place of comfort with Lazarus. This narrative suggests that Hades has become associated with judgment and suffering for the unrighteous.

2. **Acts 2:27, 31** - Peter, in his sermon at Pentecost, quotes Psalm 16:10, highlighting that Christ would not be abandoned to Hades. This implies that Hades has a more complex theological significance in the context of Christ's resurrection and victory over death. The implication can be understood as Hades being a temporary holding place, but also connected with a sense of separation for the unrighteous.

3. **Revelation 20:13-14** - This passage describes the final judgment, where Hades is depicted as giving up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades are ultimately thrown into the lake of fire, which is the second death. This imagery further associates Hades with a location of judgment leading to eternal separation from God, particularly for the unrighteous.

4. **Matthew 11:23** - Jesus mentions the city of Capernaum being brought down to Hades because of its unrepentant sin, indicating that Hades now carries connotations of punishment rather than being merely a waiting place for all the dead.

5. **Matthew 5:22** - Here, Jesus speaks of the danger of judgment for those who are angry with their brother, stating that they will be subject to judgment and could be in danger of hellfire (Gehenna). While this does not directly mention Hades, it reflects a developing understanding of locations after death associated with moral accountability.

These passages illustrate a transformation in the understanding of Hades from a generally neutral place associated with all the dead to one that increasingly signifies a realm tied to judgment, particularly for the unrighteous.
