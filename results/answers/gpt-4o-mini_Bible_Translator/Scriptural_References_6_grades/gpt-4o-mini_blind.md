The Bible includes numerous passages that describe the characteristics of fools and foolish behavior, often contrasting them with wisdom and understanding. Here are several key passages:

1. **Proverbs 1:7**: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction." This verse highlights that a fool rejects wisdom and guidance.

2. **Proverbs 10:18-19**: "Whoever conceals hatred with lying lips and spreads slander is a fool. When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but whoever restrains his lips is prudent." This suggests that fools often engage in deceit and gossip.

3. **Proverbs 12:15**: "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice." This points out that fools are often self-deceived, believing their own opinions without consideration for others.

4. **Proverbs 13:16**: "In everything the prudent acts with knowledge, but a fool flaunts his folly." Here, a fool is characterized by a lack of discretion and often boasts about their foolishness.

5. **Proverbs 14:7**: "Leave the presence of a fool, for there you do not meet words of knowledge." This advises distancing oneself from foolish individuals who do not offer wise counsel.

6. **Proverbs 18:2**: "A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion." This shows that fools are more concerned with speaking than listening or learning.

7. **Proverbs 26:11**: "Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly." This vivid imagery illustrates the tendency of fools to repeat their mistakes.

8. **Ecclesiastes 10:1**: "Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a stench; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor." This suggests that even small acts of foolishness can undermine a person's reputation.

9. **Matthew 7:26-27**: "And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock... and great was the fall of it." This parable contrasts the wise and foolish builders, indicating the folly of ignoring Godâ€™s teachings.

10. **Psalm 14:1**: "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'" This underlines the spiritual folly of atheism and denial of God's existence.

These passages develop a comprehensive biblical understanding of what it means to be a fool, emphasizing the importance of wisdom, the danger of self-deception, and the consequences of immoral behavior.
