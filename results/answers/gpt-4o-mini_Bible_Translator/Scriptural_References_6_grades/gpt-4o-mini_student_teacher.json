  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported response that effectively draws from multiple biblical passages to illustrate the characteristics of fools and foolish behavior. The inclusion of various Proverbs verses, as well as references to Ecclesiastes, Matthew, and Psalms, demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and how it relates to Christian teachings. The response aligns well with the concern of helping Christians remain vigilant against foolishness in their own lives."
