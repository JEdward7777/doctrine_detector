  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response, incorporating key scripture references that support the concept of being blameless and outlining how they can guide a Christian's life. The student effectively highlighted the importance of moral integrity, witnessing, pursuit of holiness, and community and leadership in relation to living a blameless life. The student could have improved their answer by also including the additional references mentioned in the teacher's answer for a more comprehensive coverage of scriptural support."
