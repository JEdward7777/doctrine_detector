  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response provides accurate information about the book and verse where God is referred to as \"Almighty\" in relation to Abraham, which aligns well with the given answer. The mention of Genesis 17:1 also adds specificity and credibility to the statement.\n\nHowever, I deduct 10 points because the response could be more comprehensive and engaging. For instance, it would have been great if the writer had provided some context about why this reference is significant or how it relates to God's promises in Scripture. Nevertheless, the response still effectively addresses the concern of knowing biblical references, as it helps deepen our connection to Scripture by providing a specific example.\n\nComment: While the response is mostly accurate and provides relevant information, it could be more impactful if it explored the significance of this reference and its implications for our faith."
