  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response with multiple Bible verses illustrating the theme of restoration. They displayed an understanding of how these verses convey God's redemptive plan and desire for renewing His people. However, the student missed referencing Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6, which were specifically highlighted in the teacher's answer. Incorporating these additional verses would have further strengthened the response."
