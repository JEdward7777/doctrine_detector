  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of a \"seared conscience\" and its implications for believers, they did not directly address the sensitivity to sin aspect emphasized in the reference answer. The student's analysis and application of the concept were thorough and aligned with a Christian worldview, highlighting the importance of vigilance, community, and God's grace in maintaining a tender conscience. However, the lack of direct reference to insensitivity to sin, as stated in the reference answer, slightly diminishes the overall accuracy and alignment with the specific concern provided."
