The inclusion of examples and implications helps to reinforce the concept. \n\nThe response demonstrates thoughtful analysis and application of the concept to spiritual vigilance and integrity. The student's insights on the importance of community, vigilance, and grace are particularly noteworthy.\n\nHowever, minor deductions were made due to the lack of direct engagement with the specific concern regarding spiritual vigilance and integrity. Additionally, the conclusion could have been strengthened by summarizing the key points of the answer."
