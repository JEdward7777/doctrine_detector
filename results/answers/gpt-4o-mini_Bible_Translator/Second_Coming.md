Jesus' statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds is found in passages such as Matthew 24:30, Mark 13:26, and Luke 21:27. This imagery conveys several important theological implications for believers:

1. **Hope and Expectation**: The return of the Son of Man is a promise of hope for believers. It signifies that Jesus will return in glory and power, fulfilling the promises made throughout Scripture. This anticipation encourages believers to live with hope and expectation of Christ's return.

2. **Divine Authority**: The title "Son of Man" refers to Jesus’ authority, as derived from the prophetic vision in Daniel 7:13-14, where the Son of Man is presented as a figure of divine authority. This implies that His return will denote the establishment of His kingdom and the final judgment, where He will exercise sovereignty over all creation.

3. **Judgment and Accountability**: Jesus' return is also associated with the final judgment. Believers are reminded that they will be held accountable for their actions and faithfulness during their lives. This serves as a call for vigilance and living in accordance with Christian teachings and values.

4. **Fulfillment of Scripture**: The coming of the Son of Man on the clouds connects to the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. It assures believers that God's promises throughout the Old and New Testaments are being realized.

5. **Encouragement to Persevere**: Knowing that Jesus will return gives believers the strength to endure trials and sufferings in the present world. The promise of His return serves as a motivation for perseverance and faithfulness, encouraging believers to remain steadfast in their faith, despite challenges.

6. **Unity and Community**: The imagery of Christ’s return also emphasizes the collective aspect of faith. Believers are called to encourage and support one another as they await His return, fostering a sense of community within the body of Christ.

In summary, Jesus’ statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds signifies hope, authority, judgment, fulfillment of prophecy, encouragement to persevere, and the importance of community among believers. It establishes a framework for how Christians are called to live in expectancy and faithfulness as they await His return.
