  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-supported answer that aligns with the biblical teachings on the dangers of exalting oneself. The response effectively uses scriptural references to illustrate the spiritual and moral pitfalls of pride and emphasizes the importance of humility and dependence on God. However, the response could be slightly improved by condensing the points to focus more on the core message, as the teacher's reference answer does. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective."
