## [Answer](../Self-Exaltation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
According to biblical teachings, exalting oneself can lead to several spiritual and moral dangers. Here are some key points supported by Scripture:

1. **Pride Goes Before Destruction**: Proverbs 16:18 states, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." This verse warns that when individuals exalt themselves, it often leads to their downfall.

2. **Humility is Valued**: The Bible frequently teaches that humility is a virtue. In James 4:6, it says, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." This highlights that self-exaltation not only displeases God but also blocks one from receiving His grace.

3. **Misalignment with Christ's Example**: Jesus taught and exemplified humility (Philippians 2:5-8). Exalting oneself is contrary to the model Jesus set, where He took on the form of a servant rather than seeking personal glory.

4. **Separation from Others**: Self-exaltation can create division and arrogance, leading to a lack of genuine community and fellowship. Romans 12:3 reminds believers not to think of themselves more highly than they ought to think, emphasizing a sober assessment of one’s self in light of Christ.

5. **Lack of Dependence on God**: When individuals exalt themselves, they may begin to rely on their own abilities and wisdom rather than depending on God. Proverbs 3:5-6 encourages believers to trust in the Lord with all their heart and not lean on their understanding.

6. **Judgment from God**: Ultimately, those who exalt themselves may face judgment. Luke 14:11 states, "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted." This principle underscores that God has the final authority over who is honored and who is brought low.

7. **Failure to Witness to Others**: Self-exaltation can hinder one’s ability to effectively share the Gospel. The Christian witness is meant to reflect Christ, and an attitude of pride can be a barrier to presenting the humility of Christ.

In summary, the dangers of exalting oneself include personal failure, a lack of grace from God, a departure from Christ’s example, potential isolation from genuine community, and the risk of divine judgment. Instead, Scripture encourages a posture of humility and reliance on God, which aligns with the teachings of Jesus and the nature of His kingdom.
