  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer detailing various ways Christians can serve God in their ministry according to biblical texts and principles. They covered a wide range of ministry aspects such as preaching, service, prayer, evangelism, discipleship, worship, community building, spiritual gifts, social justice, and mission work. The inclusion of relevant scripture references enhanced the answer's doctrinal soundness. However, to improve the response, the student could have emphasized the foundational importance of living a life of holiness and obedience to God's commands as integral to Christian ministry."
