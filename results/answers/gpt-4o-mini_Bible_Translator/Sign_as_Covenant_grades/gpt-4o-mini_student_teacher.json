  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the rainbow as a sign of God's covenant in Genesis, they delved too deeply into the theological implications rather than focusing on the core concept of God's promise not to destroy the earth with a flood again, which was the key point of the question. The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of God's covenant and promises in the Bible, but a more concise and direct response would have aligned better with the specific concern provided."
