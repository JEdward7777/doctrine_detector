The sign given to the shepherds in Luke 2:10-12 is significant for several reasons. The angel of the Lord tells the shepherds that they will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. This sign holds profound theological and cultural implications:

1. **Humility of Christ's Birth**: The fact that Jesus, the Savior, was born in humble circumstances (wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger) emphasizes His humility and identification with the lowly. It echoes the theme found throughout the Gospel of Luke concerning the elevation of the humble and the marginalized.

2. **Accessibility**: Shepherds were among the lower social classes in society at that time. By announcing the birth of Jesus to them first, the angel signifies that the good news of Jesus’s birth is for everyone, particularly those who may feel excluded from society. This reflects God's grace and the universal nature of the Gospel.

3. **Messianic Prophecy Fulfillment**: The specifics of the sign fulfill Old Testament prophecies regarding the coming Messiah. Though the sign is simple, it reveals profound truths about who Jesus is—God incarnate coming into the world in a vulnerable and accessible way.

4. **Contrast with Expectations**: The shepherds were likely expecting a king born in a palace, not in a stable. This contrast highlights the unexpected nature of God’s plan and the reality that His ways are often not aligned with human expectations. It calls believers to remain humble and open to God's working in unconventional ways.

5. **Divine Revelation**: The announcement to the shepherds underscores the theme of divine revelation. God chose to reveal the birth of Christ not to the powerful or the elite, but to these humble shepherds, demonstrating that His message is often delivered in surprising, ordinary circumstances.

Overall, the sign serves as a profound theological statement about the nature of Christ's mission and the manner in which God interacts with humanity, highlighting themes of humility, accessibility, and the radical inclusiveness of the Gospel.
