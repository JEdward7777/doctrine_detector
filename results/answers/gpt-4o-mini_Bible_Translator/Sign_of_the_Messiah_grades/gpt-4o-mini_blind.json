The explanation of the humility of Christ's birth, accessibility of the Gospel, fulfillment of prophecy, contrast with expectations, and divine revelation are all well articulated. The student effectively connects the sign to broader themes of God's plan and His interaction with humanity. The only improvement would be to possibly delve deeper into the specific Old Testament prophecies that were fulfilled and to tie in more explicitly the significance of the shepherds as a foreshadowing of Jesus as the Good Shepherd."
