They effectively highlighted various aspects such as encountering God, sacrifice and atonement, covenantal significance, centralization of worship, symbol of God's presence, expressions of thankfulness and dedication, and cultural and national identity. While the student's answer goes beyond the reference answer by exploring different dimensions of altar worship, it aligns well with the concern of understanding the importance of altars in biblical worship for Christians."
