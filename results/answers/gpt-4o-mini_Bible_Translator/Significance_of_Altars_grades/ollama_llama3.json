While it does not explicitly address the concern about understanding the importance of altars in biblical worship helping Christians appreciate the concept of sacrifice and devotion, the response implicitly touches on this concern by highlighting the atoning nature of sacrifices made at altars. The inclusion of specific examples from Scripture (e.g., Abraham, Jacob, and Moses) and a clear summary statement also demonstrate the writer's understanding of the topic. However, the response could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting the significance of altars to Christian concepts of sacrifice and devotion."
