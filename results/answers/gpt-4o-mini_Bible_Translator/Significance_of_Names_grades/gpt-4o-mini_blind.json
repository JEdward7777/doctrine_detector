  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a personal name in biblical translations. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of how this translation choice impacts theological understanding, contextual use, relational dynamics, theological continuity, and cultural considerations. The explanation is detailed and well-supported with relevant examples from Scripture. The student effectively connects the translation of \"Shaddai\" to broader themes of God's nature and character in the Bible. Great job overall."
