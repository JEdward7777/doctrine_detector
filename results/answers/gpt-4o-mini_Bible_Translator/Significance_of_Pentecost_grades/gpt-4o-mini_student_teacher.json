  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the significance of the Day of Pentecost, demonstrating a strong understanding of the event's importance. The response effectively incorporates scriptural references and highlights various aspects of Pentecost in relation to the Holy Spirit. However, the concern specifically requested a focus on the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. While the student touched on this aspect in points 3 and 4, the response could have delved deeper into the direct impact of the Holy Spirit on individual believers and their ongoing relationship with God. Despite this slight deviation from the specified concern, the student's answer overall shows a solid grasp of the significance of Pentecost from a Christian worldview."
