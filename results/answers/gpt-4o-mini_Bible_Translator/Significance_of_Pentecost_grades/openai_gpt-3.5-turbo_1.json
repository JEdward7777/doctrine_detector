It not only acknowledges the empowerment for ministry and fulfillment of Jesus' promise but also delves deeper into the multiple dimensions of Pentecost, such as the birth of the Church, the unity and diversity it represents, the new covenant significance, and the prophetic fulfillment. The response effectively conveys the transformative impact of the Holy Spirit on the early disciples and the establishment of the Christian community."
