It effectively expands on the role of the Holy Spirit by highlighting key aspects such as the fulfillment of Jesus' promise, birth of the Church, empowerment of believers for ministry, and the establishment of a new covenant community. The response is well-supported by scriptural references and aligns with a Christian worldview."
