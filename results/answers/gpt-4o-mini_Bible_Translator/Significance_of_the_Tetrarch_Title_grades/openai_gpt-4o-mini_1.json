It effectively addresses the concern by showing how understanding the role of tetrarchs helps believers grasp the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry. The integration of this historical context with a Christian worldview could be further enhanced by connecting it to specific biblical events or teachings to deepen the theological implications."
