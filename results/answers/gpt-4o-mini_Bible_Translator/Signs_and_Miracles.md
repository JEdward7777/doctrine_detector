## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Signs and miracles have a significant role in the New Testament as both affirmations of faith and validations of God's message. Throughout the ministry of Jesus and the apostles, these acts serve several critical purposes within the Christian narrative:

1. **Authenticating the Messenger**: In the Gospels, miracles serve to validate Jesus' identity as the Son of God. For example, in John 10:37-38, Jesus challenges the skeptics to consider His works as evidence of His divine commission. Similarly, in the book of Acts, the apostles perform signs and wonders that authenticate their ministry and message (Acts 2:22).

2. **Revealing God's Nature and Compassion**: Miracles reflect the character of God—His love, mercy, and compassion. Jesus’ healing of the sick, feeding of the hungry, and raising of the dead demonstrate God's care for humanity and His power over creation (Matthew 14:13-21). These acts are intended not just as displays of power, but as demonstrations of God's heart for people.

3. **Provoking Faith**: Signs and miracles often provoke faith among witnesses and beneficiaries. John 20:30-31 notes that the signs were written so that people might believe that Jesus is the Messiah. The intention behind these miracles is to lead individuals to a deeper faith and understanding of God.

4. **Illustrating Spiritual Truths**: Many miracles performed by Jesus also serve as parables, illustrating deeper spiritual truths. For example, the healing of a blind man (John 9) symbolizes spiritual blindness and the need for Jesus as the light of the world.

5. **Establishing the Early Church**: In the early years of the church, miracles performed by the apostles helped to establish credibility and attract new believers. Acts 5:12-16 describes how many signs and wonders were performed by the apostles, leading to an increase in the number of believers.

6. **Prefiguring the Kingdom of God**: Miracles serve as a foretaste of the Kingdom of God, pointing towards the ultimate restoration that Jesus will bring. The healings and exorcisms in the Gospels illustrate the breaking in of God’s kingdom and His triumph over sin and death.

In essence, signs and miracles play a pivotal role in demonstrating God's presence and authority, pointing toward the truth of the Gospel and deepening the faith of believers. They are interwoven with the core message of salvation in Christ and are instrumental in understanding God's active work in history.
