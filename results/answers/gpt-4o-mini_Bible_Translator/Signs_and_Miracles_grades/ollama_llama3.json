The answer is closely related to the concern of examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation.\n\nThe response successfully elaborates on the various purposes of signs and miracles in the Christian narrative, providing biblical examples to support its claims. The analysis is thoughtful, well-organized, and shows a good understanding of the theological significance of these events.\n\nOne area for improvement would be to further explore the connection between faith and signs, potentially highlighting the ways in which Jesus' miracles were not only demonstrations of God's power but also invitations for people to trust in Him. Nonetheless, the response provides a strong foundation for understanding the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation."
