It effectively expands on the role of signs and miracles in authenticating God's power and message, revealing His character and compassion, provoking faith, illustrating spiritual truths, establishing the early church, and prefiguring the Kingdom of God. The integration of relevant biblical references enhances the credibility of the argument. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of faith as an essential component in perceiving and responding to signs and miracles in God's revelation."
