The student effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on how signs and miracles authenticate the message of Jesus and the apostles, provoke faith, reveal God's nature and compassion, illustrate spiritual truths, establish the early church, and prefigure the Kingdom of God. The explanation is thorough, grounded in biblical references, and aligned with a Christian worldview. Overall, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic."
