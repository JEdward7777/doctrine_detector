  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the term \"Son of God\" in relation to Jesus and His relationship with God the Father from a Christian perspective. The theological implications are well articulated, referencing key biblical passages and doctrines related to Jesus' divine sonship, messiahship, intimate relationship with the Father, and role in revealing God to humanity. The only area for improvement would be to include more direct references to specific passages like Hebrews 1:1-3 to further support the points made."
