  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response correctly acknowledges Jesus' divinity and eternal relationship with God, which addresses the concern of understanding His divinity and relationship with God. However, it lacks depth and detail in exploring these concepts further. The provided answer is brief and does not fully capture the theological implications of \"Son of God\" in Christian theology. The graded response provides more context and explanation, but it still falls short of providing a comprehensive understanding of Jesus' divinity and relationship with God."
