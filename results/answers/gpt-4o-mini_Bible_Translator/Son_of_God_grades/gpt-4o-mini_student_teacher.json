  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the distinction between the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus and the term 'sons of God' used for believers. The answer effectively highlights the key differences in nature, eternal relationship, authority and role, and purpose and mission between the two terms. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the core distinction stated in the reference answer, which is that 'Son of God' specifically pertains to Jesus as God's only Son, while 'sons of God' refers broadly to all believers in Christ. This central distinction should have been emphasized more prominently throughout the response."
