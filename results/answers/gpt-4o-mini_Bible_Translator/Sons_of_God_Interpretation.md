## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The term 'sons of God' in the Bible, and specifically in the context of Genesis 6:1-4, has been subject to various interpretations throughout Christian history. Here are some of the primary interpretations:

1. **Lineage of Seth**: One traditional interpretation posits that the 'sons of God' refer to the descendants of Seth, the godly line of Adam. In this view, the 'daughters of men' are understood to be the descendants of Cain, suggesting a biblical theme of the righteous intermingling with the unrighteous, which may lead to moral decline.

2. **Fallen Angels**: Another popular interpretation, especially among some early Church Fathers (like Justin Martyr and Tertullian) and certain strands of Jewish thought, is that the 'sons of God' are fallen angels or heavenly beings who took human wives. This interpretation is linked to the idea that these unions produced the Nephilim, often viewed as giants or mighty beings.

3. **Royalty or Judges**: Some scholars suggest that 'sons of God' denotes kings or rulers, possibly because in ancient Near Eastern cultures, kings were sometimes seen as divine or semi-divine figures. In this context, the verse could be addressing the corrupt practices of power and authority, where rulers took for themselves wives from among the common people.

4. **Prominently Interpreted as Referring to Humanity**: In a broader interpretation, some argue that 'sons of God' could represent humanity in general, emphasizing human sinfulness and the moral decay leading up to the Flood. This view focuses less on specific lineages and more on the collective nature of mankindâ€™s rebellion against God.

5. **Combining Interpretations**: Some modern scholars propose a combination of these views, suggesting that the passage may blend cultural concepts of divine beings with human social structures and moral failings.

Each interpretation carries different theological implications: the lineage view may stress the importance of faithfulness and lineage, the angelic view may explore themes of divine judgment and cosmic rebellion, while the royalty interpretation could reflect on the nature of power and corruption. The Nephilim, referred to in the same passage, further complicates these readings by introducing an enigmatic figure whose identity and significance are debated.

Overall, readers of this passage are encouraged to consider the historical, literary, and theological contexts that inform these various interpretations.
