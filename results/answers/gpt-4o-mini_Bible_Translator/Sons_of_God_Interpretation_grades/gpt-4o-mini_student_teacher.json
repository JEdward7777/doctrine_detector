  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85. \n\nThe student demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the various interpretations of the term 'sons of God' in Genesis 6, showing awareness of historical and theological perspectives. The response was well-structured and detailed, covering a range of interpretations and their implications. However, while the student did a commendable job in presenting different viewpoints, the teacher's answer provided a more concise summary which could have been reflected in the student's response for better clarity and focus. Overall, the student showed a strong grasp of the topic but could enhance the clarity and conciseness of their explanation to align more closely with the reference answer."
