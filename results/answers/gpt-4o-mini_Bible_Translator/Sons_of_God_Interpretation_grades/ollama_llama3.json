  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that there are different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6:1-4, which shows an understanding of biblical interpretation being important for grasping scripture passages. The answer also mentions three possible interpretations (fallen angels, powerful political rulers, and descendants of Seth) which is a good start.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more detail on each interpretation, rather than just listing them. Additionally, it would have been helpful to explore how these different interpretations shed light on the meaning of the passage as a whole, or how they relate to other biblical themes and concepts.\n\nOverall, while the response demonstrates some understanding of biblical interpretation, it could be strengthened by providing more depth and analysis of the various interpretations."
