It emphasizes the central role of faith in Jesus in the process of sanctification and holiness, which aligns with the concern provided. The response effectively reinforces the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of holiness in Christian doctrine. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a direct reference to a specific Bible verse affirming the connection between faith in Jesus and holiness/sanctification."
