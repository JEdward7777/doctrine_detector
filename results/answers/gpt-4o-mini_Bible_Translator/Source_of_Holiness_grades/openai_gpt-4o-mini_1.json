The incorporation of key aspects such as justification, the role of the Holy Spirit, sanctification, and the community of saints aligns well with the Christian doctrine. The connection to the central role of faith in Jesus is clear throughout the response, demonstrating a strong understanding of how holiness is sourced in Christianity."
