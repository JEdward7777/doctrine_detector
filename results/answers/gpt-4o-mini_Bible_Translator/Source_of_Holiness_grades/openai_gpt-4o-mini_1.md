## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ. The term "saint" is generally understood to refer to those who are set apart for God, and in the New Testament, all believers in Christ are often referred to as saints. Here are some key aspects of how believers become saints:

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: According to Christian doctrine, particularly as expressed in the New Testament, salvation and sainthood begin with faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Ephesians 2:8-9 states that it is by grace through faith that individuals are saved, not by their own works.

2. **Justification**: Believers are justified before God through their faith in Christ. Romans 5:1 explains that “since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” This justification is what qualifies believers as saints, as they are deemed righteous in God's sight.

3. **The Role of the Holy Spirit**: Upon accepting Christ, believers receive the Holy Spirit, which empowers them to live a holy life. The presence of the Holy Spirit is an essential aspect of sanctification, the process by which believers are made holy and more conformed to the image of Christ (1 Corinthians 6:19).

4. **Sanctification**: While all believers are considered saints because of their position in Christ, there is also a process of ongoing sanctification that occurs in the life of a believer. This is a gradual process of becoming more like Christ through obedience to God's word, prayer, and the transformative work of the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:5-7).

5. **The Community of Saints**: In the Christian tradition, particularly in Catholicism and some other denominations, the term "saint" can also refer to those who have led exemplary lives of faith and are recognized by the Church as being in Heaven. However, in a broader and fundamental sense, all believers are saints by virtue of their relationship with Christ.

In summary, all believers who place their faith in Jesus Christ are considered saints because of their justification, their new identity in Christ, and the work of the Holy Spirit in their lives. They are called to live out that saintly identity through a life of holiness.
