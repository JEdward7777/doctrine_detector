  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively distinguishes between spiritual and earthly authorities based on biblical principles. They referenced relevant Bible verses and highlighted key differences in source, purpose, nature of governance, and obedience and accountability. However, the student's answer did not directly address the central concern of recognizing the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority and their implications in a Christian's life as given in the reference answer. The student's response delved more into the characteristics and roles of spiritual and earthly authorities rather than specifically addressing the concern provided."
