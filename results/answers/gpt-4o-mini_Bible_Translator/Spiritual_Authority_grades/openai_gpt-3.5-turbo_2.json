  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities from a Christian worldview, supported by relevant biblical references. It effectively addresses the concern by clearly articulating the differences in their source, purpose, nature of governance, and the believer's responsibility towards each type of authority. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic within a Christian context."
