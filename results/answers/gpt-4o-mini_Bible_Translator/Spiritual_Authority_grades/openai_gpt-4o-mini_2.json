  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-explained analysis of the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities from a Christian worldview. The citation of relevant biblical verses and the clear delineation of source, purpose, nature of governance, and obedience/accountability aspects are commendable. The response effectively addresses the concern raised and demonstrates a strong understanding of the implications of these authorities in a Christian's life. Great job!"
