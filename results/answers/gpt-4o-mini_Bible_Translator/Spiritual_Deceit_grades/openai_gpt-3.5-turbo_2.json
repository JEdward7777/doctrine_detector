It effectively builds upon the provided answer by emphasizing the connection between demons, idolatry, and the deception that leads people away from worshiping the one true God. The response aligns well with the concern about the importance of Christians being vigilant against spiritual deceit, emphasizing the need to recognize and resist influences that divert believers from the truth of God's sovereignty."
