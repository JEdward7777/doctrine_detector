  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of \"circumcision of the heart\" in a Christian context, connecting it well to both Old and New Testament passages. They describe the spiritual transformation and renewal that takes place within an individual, emphasizing the internal change and surrender to God that this symbolizes. The student also highlights the shift from external rituals to internal transformation, capturing the essence of the spiritual implications of this concept.\n\nWhile the student's answer aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer, they could have provided a more explicit connection to the removal of sin and purification through faith in Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of transformation. Including this aspect would have further strengthened the Christian perspective of the response."
