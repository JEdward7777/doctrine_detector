## [Answer](../Spiritual_Significance_of_Circumcision.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The phrase "circumcision of the heart" symbolizes a spiritual transformation and renewal within an individual, emphasizing the need for inward change rather than mere adherence to external religious practices. In the Christian context, it is often associated with the idea of being set apart for God, having one's heart purified, and being receptive to the Holy Spirit.

This concept has its roots in the Old Testament, particularly in Deuteronomy 10:16, which calls for the people of Israel to "circumcise their hearts" and not be stubborn. In the New Testament, Paul references this theme in Romans 2:28-29, where he asserts that true circumcision is a matter of the heart, accomplished by the Spirit rather than by the letter of the Law.

Overall, the "circumcision of the heart" signifies a surrender to God, a transformative faith that leads to genuine obedience and a relationship with Him, highlighting the move from external rituals to an internal disposition of love, devotion, and repentance.
