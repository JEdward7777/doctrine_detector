  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive analysis of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church, addressing key points such as martyrdom, challenges of persecution, theological implications, imitation of Christ, and encouragement for believers. The student effectively connects the event to the themes of faithfulness, persecution, and discipleship. However, the response could have been strengthened by more directly focusing on the cost of discipleship and emphasizing the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution as highlighted in the concern. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively incorporates a Christian worldview throughout the analysis."
