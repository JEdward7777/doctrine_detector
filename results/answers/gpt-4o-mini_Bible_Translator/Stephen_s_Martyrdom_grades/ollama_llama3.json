  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly addresses the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution, using Stephen's stoning as a prime example. It provides a clear and concise analysis of the theological, historical, and missional significance of Stephen's martyrdom, highlighting its impact on the early Christian church.\n\nThe response skillfully explores the various themes related to Stephen's story, including the catalystic effect of his martyrdom, the challenges faced by early believers, and the theological turning point marked by his speech before the Sanhedrin. It also thoughtfully considers the character of Jesus and the importance of imitating Christ-like humility and forgiveness in the face of adversity.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in providing more explicit connections to the Christian worldview and the broader scriptural context. While the reference to Matthew 28:19-20 is helpful, a few more specific examples or allusions to Christian theology and tradition would further strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent response that effectively engages with the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution."
