  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid analysis of the practice of stoning for adultery in both the Old and New Testaments. They accurately explain the cultural and theological context behind the Mosaic laws while effectively contrasting it with Jesus' teachings on mercy and repentance. The response demonstrates a good understanding of God's justice and mercy as portrayed in Scripture. One suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more scriptural references to support the points made and strengthen the theological argument presented. Overall, a well-structured and thoughtful response."
