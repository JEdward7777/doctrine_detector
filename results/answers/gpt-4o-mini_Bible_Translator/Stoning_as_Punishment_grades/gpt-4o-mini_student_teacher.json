  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response, incorporating both Old Testament principles regarding stoning for adultery and the New Testament perspective exemplified by Jesus' interaction with the adulterous woman. The student effectively addressed the concern of balancing God's justice and mercy in His commandments and demonstrated a clear understanding of how these concepts are portrayed in the Bible. The answer could be further improved by explicitly connecting the Old Testament practice of stoning to God's justice and mercy, but overall, it was a strong and insightful analysis."
