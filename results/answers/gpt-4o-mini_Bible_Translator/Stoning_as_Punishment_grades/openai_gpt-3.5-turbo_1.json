The student effectively discusses the Old Testament commandments regarding stoning for adultery, the shift in approach seen in the New Testament through Jesus' teachings on mercy and forgiveness, and the broader theological implications of God's justice and mercy. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of how God's justice is tempered by His mercy, ultimately leading to a more compassionate and redemptive approach to sin. Great job incorporating a Christian worldview perspective."
