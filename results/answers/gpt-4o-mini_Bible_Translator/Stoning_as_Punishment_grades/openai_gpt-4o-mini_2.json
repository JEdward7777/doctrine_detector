It effectively integrates biblical references from both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the shift in approach from strict punishment to mercy and forgiveness as demonstrated by Jesus. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of how God's justice and mercy interact in the context of sin and punishment. Well done!"
