## [Answer](../Structure_of_the_Tabernacle.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Tabernacle, as described in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, was divided into two main sections: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place (also known as the Holy of Holies).

1. **The Holy Place**: This was the first section of the Tabernacle. Within the Holy Place, several important items were located:
   - **The Golden Lampstand (Menorah)**: This provided light in the Holy Place.
   - **The Table of Showbread**: This held twelve loaves of bread, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, which were renewed every Sabbath.
   - **The Altar of Incense**: This was used for burning incense, symbolizing the prayers of the people rising to God.

2. **The Most Holy Place (Holy of Holies)**: This was the innermost section of the Tabernacle, separated from the Holy Place by a veil. The Most Holy Place contained:
   - **The Ark of the Covenant**: This was a sacred chest that contained the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod that budded, and a pot of manna. The Ark represented God's presence among His people and had a cover known as the Mercy Seat, where God was said to dwell in a special way.

Access to the Most Holy Place was restricted to the High Priest and only on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), highlighting the holiness of God and the need for atonement for sin.
