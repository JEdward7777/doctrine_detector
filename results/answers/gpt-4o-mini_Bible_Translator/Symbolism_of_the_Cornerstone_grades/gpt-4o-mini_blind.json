  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: This response provides a comprehensive and well-supported analysis of the metaphor of the cornerstone in illustrating the relationship between Jesus and His followers. The student effectively explains the foundational, unifying, strengthening, and purposeful aspects of this metaphor, tying in relevant biblical references to support their points. The response could be strengthened by further elaboration on how believers are \"living stones\" being built into a spiritual house and how each individual believer plays a specific role in the body of Christ. Overall, a solid and insightful exploration of the topic."
