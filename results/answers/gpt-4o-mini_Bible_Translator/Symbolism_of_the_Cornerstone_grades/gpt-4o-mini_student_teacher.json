  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student has done an excellent job elaborating on various aspects of the metaphor of the cornerstone in relation to Jesus and His followers. They have effectively explained the significance of Jesus as the foundation of faith, unity, strength, acceptance, and purpose for believers. The student's response is comprehensive, well-supported with biblical references, and effectively conveys the profound relationship between Jesus and His followers. However, the student's answer could have been improved by tying their points back explicitly to the concern provided and focusing more on how understanding this relationship can help believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that showcases a deep understanding of the metaphor and its implications for the relationship between Jesus and His followers."
