  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response thoroughly explores the metaphor of the cornerstone, effectively illustrating the relationship between Jesus and His followers. It highlights the foundation, unity, strength, acceptance, and purpose that Christ provides for believers, demonstrating a clear understanding of the biblical context and its significance. The summary nicely wraps up the main themes, making it easy to grasp the importance of this metaphor in Christian faith.\n\nWhile the response is excellent overall, there is some room for improvement. A more explicit connection between the cornerstone metaphor and the concern about aligning lives with Christ's teachings and example would strengthen the argument. Additionally, a few sentences could be condensed or rephrased for better clarity and flow. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a high level of comprehension and application of Christian principles, making it deserving of a high grade."
