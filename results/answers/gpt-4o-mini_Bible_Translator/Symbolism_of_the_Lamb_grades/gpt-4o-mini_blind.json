The student effectively connects key points such as the symbolism of innocence and purity, the Passover lamb, atonement and substitution, foreshadowing Christ, and the New Covenant. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological significance of the lamb in sacrifices and how it points towards Jesus Christ as the ultimate atonement. There are no major doctrinal errors, and the answer is well-structured and informative. Great job overall!"
