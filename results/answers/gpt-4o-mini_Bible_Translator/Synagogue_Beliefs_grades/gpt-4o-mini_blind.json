The points made are doctrinally sound and well-supported with relevant biblical references. However, to improve, the student could further emphasize the distinction between the roles of synagogues in Judaism and churches in Christianity, highlighting the unique aspects of Christian community, worship, and mission. Additionally, providing more specific examples or illustrations could enrich the response."
