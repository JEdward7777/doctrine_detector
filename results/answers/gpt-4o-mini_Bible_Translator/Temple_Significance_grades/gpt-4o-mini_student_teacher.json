  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the purpose of the temple constructed by King Solomon, covering various aspects such as its role as a dwelling place for God, a place of worship, a symbol of unity, a reminder of the covenant relationship, and its judicial and social functions. While the student's answer is well-researched and informative, it deviates slightly from the specific concern by focusing on broader aspects of the temple's significance rather than emphasizing its primary purpose in the context of Old Testament worship, as outlined in the reference answer. Therefore, the grade reflects a strong understanding of the topic but a slight lack of alignment with the concern provided."
