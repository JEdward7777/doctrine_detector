  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-organized response exploring the concept of God dwelling among His people in both the Old and New Testaments. They effectively cover key points from both periods and discuss how the concept evolves, particularly highlighting Jesus as the new temple and the church as the dwelling place of God through the Holy Spirit. The answer effectively addresses the theological implications of God's presence among His people. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly referencing the teacher's answer to show a clear comparison and analysis."
