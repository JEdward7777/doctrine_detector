  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response thoroughly explores the concept of God dwelling among His people in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the significance of the temple as a symbol of God's presence. It effectively outlines the progression from the physical tabernacle to Solomon's Temple, and then to Jesus Christ becoming the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity.\n\nThe discussion on symbolism, especially in the context of Ezekiel's prophesies, adds depth to the response. The exploration of the New Testament's development of the concept, including the idea of believers being the \"temple of God\" and the eschatological vision in Revelation 21:22, is also well-done.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the different theological implications. While it touches on some of these implications, such as the covenant relationship and the hope of God's return, a more direct exploration of how these implications unfold throughout Scripture would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept and its theological significance. With some further development and connection-making, it could be even stronger!"
