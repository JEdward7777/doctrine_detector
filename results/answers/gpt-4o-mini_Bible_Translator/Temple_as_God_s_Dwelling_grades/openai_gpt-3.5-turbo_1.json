  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-supported exploration of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people. It offers a detailed examination of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the evolution of this concept from physical structures to the spiritual reality of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit. The inclusion of biblical references and themes such as covenant relationship, divine holiness, Jesus as the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity, and the eschatological vision adds depth and richness to the analysis. Overall, a strong theological reflection is presented in the response."
