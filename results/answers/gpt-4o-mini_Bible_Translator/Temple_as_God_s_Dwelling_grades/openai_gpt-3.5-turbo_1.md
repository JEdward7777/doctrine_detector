## [Answer](../Temple_as_God_s_Dwelling.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of the temple as God's dwelling is a significant theme in both the Old and New Testaments, reflecting God's desire to be present among His people.

### Old Testament

1. **The Tabernacle**:
   - The initial structure representing God's presence among the Israelites was the Tabernacle, as detailed in Exodus (Exodus 25:8-9). It was a portable sanctuary designed to be moved with the Israelites during their wanderings in the desert. God instructed Moses to construct it to house His presence, signified by the Shekinah glory.

2. **Solomon's Temple**:
   - Eventually, King Solomon built a permanent temple in Jerusalem, which replaced the Tabernacle as the dwelling place of God (1 Kings 6). The temple was a majestic structure where sacrifices could be made, and rituals could be performed. The Holy of Holies, the innermost chamber, was believed to be the dwelling place of God's presence (1 Kings 8:10-11).

3. **Symbolism**:
   - The temple acted as a symbol of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It represented divine holiness and the conditions of worship. Prophets like Ezekiel emphasized both the glory of God departing from the temple due to Israel's sin (Ezekiel 10:18-19) and the hope of God's return (Ezekiel 43:1-5).

### New Testament

1. **Jesus as the Temple**:
   - In the New Testament, the concept of the temple shifts dramatically with the coming of Jesus Christ. In John 2:19-21, Jesus refers to His body as the temple, indicating that through His death and resurrection, He becomes the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity. This signifies a new era in which God's presence is not confined to a physical structure.

2. **The Church as a Temple**:
   - The New Testament further develops the idea by teaching that believers collectively form the "temple of God." According to 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 and Ephesians 2:19-22, the church—composed of all believers—becomes the dwelling place of God through the Holy Spirit. This emphasizes the notion that God’s presence is now with His people wherever they are, rather than being limited to a specific location.

3. **The Eschatological Vision**:
   - The book of Revelation describes a future reality where God’s presence will be fully realized among His people. In Revelation 21:22, it is stated that there is no temple in the New Jerusalem because God and the Lamb (Jesus Christ) will be its temple, signifying a direct and unmediated presence of God among His redeemed people.

### Summary
The temple as God's dwelling evolves from the physical Tabernacle and Temple of the Old Testament to the person of Jesus Christ and the collective body of believers in the New Testament. This progression highlights the intimate relationship God longs to have with humanity, culminating in the promise of eternal communion with Him in the new creation.
