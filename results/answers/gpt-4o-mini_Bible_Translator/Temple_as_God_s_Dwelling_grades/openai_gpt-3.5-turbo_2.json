It effectively highlights the significance of the temple in representing God's presence among His people, the shift in understanding with Jesus as the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity, and the transformation of believers collectively forming the temple of God. The response also addresses the eschatological vision of God's full presence among His redeemed people. It demonstrates a deep understanding of how God's dwelling among His people evolves throughout salvation history, emphasizing the intimate relationship God desires to have with humanity."
