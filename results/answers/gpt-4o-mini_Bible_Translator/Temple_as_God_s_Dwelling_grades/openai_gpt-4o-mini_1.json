The inclusion of the Tabernacle, Solomon's Temple, Jesus as the Temple, the Church as a Temple, and the eschatological vision from Revelation demonstrates a deep understanding of God's presence throughout salvation history. The response effectively conveys the significance of God's desire for intimate relationship with humanity, culminating in the promise of eternal communion. Well done!"
