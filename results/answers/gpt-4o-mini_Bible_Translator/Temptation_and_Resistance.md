## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Gospel accounts, particularly in Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13, Jesus responds to the temptations presented by Satan with Scripture and a firm adherence to God's will. After fasting for 40 days, Jesus faces three specific temptations:

1. **Turning Stones to Bread**: Satan tempts Jesus to use His power to satisfy His hunger. Jesus responds by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3, stating, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." This highlights His reliance on God rather than material needs.

2. **Testing God by Jumping from the Temple**: Satan challenges Jesus to throw Himself from the pinnacle of the Temple, suggesting that angels would save Him. Jesus counters by quoting Deuteronomy 6:16, saying, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." Here, Jesus emphasizes trust in God without requiring proof of His protection.

3. **Worshiping Satan for Earthly Power**: Finally, Satan offers Jesus all the kingdoms of the world if He worships him. Jesus responds with a quote from Deuteronomy 6:13, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve." This reinforces His commitment to worship only God and His rejection of earthly power through sinful means.

Throughout these encounters, Jesus demonstrates His commitment to God's Word and His purpose, thus embodying obedience and faithfulness to God even in the face of temptation.
