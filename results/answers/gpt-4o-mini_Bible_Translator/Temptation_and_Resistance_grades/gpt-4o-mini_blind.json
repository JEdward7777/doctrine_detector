  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of how Jesus responded to the temptations presented by Satan. The student effectively references the relevant passages in Matthew and Luke and correctly interprets Jesus' responses in alignment with Scripture. The emphasis on Jesus' reliance on God's Word, trust in God's protection, and rejection of earthly power through sinful means is commendable. Additionally, the student showcases an understanding of the theological significance behind Jesus's responses. Great job overall, with just minor room for improvement in deepening theological insights."
