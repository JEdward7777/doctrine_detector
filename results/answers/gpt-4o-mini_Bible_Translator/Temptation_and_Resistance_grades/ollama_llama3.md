## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Gospel accounts, particularly in Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13, Jesus responds to the temptations presented by Satan with Scripture and a firm adherence to God's will. After fasting for 40 days, Jesus faces three specific temptations:

1. **Turning Stones to Bread**: Satan tempts Jesus to use His power to satisfy His hunger. Jesus responds by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3, stating, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." This highlights His reliance on God rather than material needs.

2. **Testing God by Jumping from the Temple**: Satan challenges Jesus to throw Himself from the pinnacle of the Temple, suggesting that angels would save Him. Jesus counters by quoting Deuteronomy 6:16, saying, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." Here, Jesus emphasizes trust in God without requiring proof of His protection.

3. **Worshiping Satan for Earthly Power**: Finally, Satan offers Jesus all the kingdoms of the world if He worships him. Jesus responds with a quote from Deuteronomy 6:13, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve." This reinforces His commitment to worship only God and His rejection of earthly power through sinful means.

Throughout these encounters, Jesus demonstrates His commitment to God's Word and His purpose, thus embodying obedience and faithfulness to God even in the face of temptation.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 95

The response thoroughly addresses the concern of understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation as a model for Christians. The writer provides a detailed analysis of the three temptations, highlighting Jesus' reliance on Scripture and commitment to God's will. The use of specific biblical references (Deuteronomy 8:3, Deuteronomy 6:16, and Deuteronomy 6:13) adds depth and authority to the response.

The only area for improvement is that the writer could have more explicitly connected Jesus' resistance to temptation to a larger theological framework. For example, they could have discussed how Jesus' obedience reflects His humanity and divinity, or how it models the Christian's struggle against sin. Nonetheless, the response effectively demonstrates Jesus' commitment to God and provides a strong model for Christians to follow.

The original answer is adequately supported by the detailed explanations in the response, which earns high marks. The concern is also well-addressed through the examination of Jesus' temptations and His reliance on Scripture. Overall, this is an excellent response that effectively explores the significance of Jesus' resistance to temptation.
