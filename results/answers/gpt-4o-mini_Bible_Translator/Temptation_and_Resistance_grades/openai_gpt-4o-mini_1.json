It effectively connects Jesus' actions to a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil, emphasizing the importance of reliance on God's Word and obedience. However, you could further enhance the Christian worldview perspective by explicitly mentioning the significance of Jesus as the perfect example for believers to resist temptation and follow His teachings in overcoming evil."
