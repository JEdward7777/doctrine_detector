  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student provided a well-thought-out response that delves into the concept of tempting God by explaining it through biblical examples and providing various forms in which this behavior can manifest. They also effectively discussed the potential consequences of tempting God based on biblical teachings. \n\nHowever, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly incorporating the reference answer provided by the teacher, which succinctly defines the concept of 'tempting God' as acting in stubborn disobedience to God\u2019s commands leading to the possibility of divine punishment. Aligning their answer more closely with the specific definition given in the reference answer would have enhanced the clarity and precision of their response."
