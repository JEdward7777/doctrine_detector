  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the various terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in Christian communities. They provide a well-organized and informative overview of the different denominations' terminology along with their respective theological significance. The response also acknowledges the diverse theological perspectives surrounding the sacrament while offering a well-rounded explanation. \n\nHowever, the reference answer provided by the teacher only includes two terms, \"communion\" and \"Last Supper,\" omitting several other significant names listed in the student's response. This slightly reduces the score due to the omission of key terms relevant to the prompt."
