  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThis response only touches on two terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, whereas the original answer lists eight different terms and provides brief explanations for each. While it does acknowledge that there are different terms used within Christianity, it lacks depth and breadth in its exploration of these terms. Additionally, it does not provide any theological insights or connections between the different terms, which is an important aspect of understanding this sacred practice.\n\nComment: The response shows some awareness of the different terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, but it does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the various meanings and significance behind these terms."
