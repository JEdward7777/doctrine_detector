  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of alternative terms that can be used to describe a deacon, showcasing a good understanding of the various service roles within the church. The answer aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the servant-hearted nature of the deacon's role. The inclusion of terms like \"Elder\" and \"Servant-Leader\" demonstrates a thoughtful exploration of the topic. The answer could be improved by more directly focusing on the specific terms mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
