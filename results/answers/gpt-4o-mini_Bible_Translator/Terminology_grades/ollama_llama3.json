  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning alternative ways to identify service roles within the church, specifically referencing the deacon as a \"church minister,\" \"church worker,\" or \"church servant.\" However, it does not fully capture the variety and nuance mentioned in the original response. The mention of these three alternatives is a good start, but it would be strengthened by incorporating more terms, such as \"servant,\" \"helper,\" \"elder,\" and \"coordinator,\" which were listed in the original description.\n\nOverall, while the response shows some effort to recognize different ways to identify service roles, it could benefit from a more comprehensive and detailed approach to fully address this concern."
