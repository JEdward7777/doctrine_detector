The inclusion of these terms aligns well with the concern of recognizing the various ways to identify service roles within the church. However, the response could have been enhanced by further elaboration on additional terms like \"helper\", \"elder\", \"coordinator\", and \"servant-leader\" to provide a more comprehensive view."
