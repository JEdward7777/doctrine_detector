## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The three terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible are "Israel," "the Jews," and "the children of God." 

1. **Israel** refers to both the ancient nation descended from Jacob (whose name was changed to Israel) and, in a broader theological sense, to the spiritual descendants of Abraham, including those who have faith in Christ.

2. **The Jews** specifically denotes the descendants of the tribe of Judah and, more broadly, refers to the people of the Jewish faith and culture, especially following the Babylonian exile.

3. **The children of God** is a term that emphasizes the relationship between believers and God, signifying both the people of Israel and, in the context of the New Testament, all who have faith in Jesus Christ, thereby becoming part of God's family.

These terms highlight different aspects of God's covenantal relationship with His people throughout the scriptures.
