Before ascending to heaven, Jesus gave His disciples the Great Commission, which is recorded in Matthew 28:18-20. In this passage, Jesus instructs His disciples to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe all that He has commanded. He promises that He will be with them always, to the end of the age. This command underscores the importance of evangelism and discipleship in the Christian faith.
