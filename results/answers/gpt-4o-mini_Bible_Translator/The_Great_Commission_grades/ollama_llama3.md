## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Before ascending to heaven, Jesus gave His disciples the Great Commission, which is recorded in Matthew 28:18-20. In this passage, Jesus instructs His disciples to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe all that He has commanded. He promises that He will be with them always, to the end of the age. This command underscores the importance of evangelism and discipleship in the Christian faith.

90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 90.

The student has accurately summarized the key points of the Great Commission, including Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations, baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teach them to obey everything He had commanded. The student's paraphrase of Jesus' instruction is also very close to the original text.

The only area for improvement is that the student does not explicitly mention the importance of evangelism in the Great Commission, which is a crucial aspect of the passage. However, this is still a minor flaw, and overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission.

Comment: Well done! Your summary of the Great Commission is accurate and concise. While you could have emphasized the importance of evangelism more explicitly, your response still shows a clear understanding of Jesus' mission to make disciples of all nations.
