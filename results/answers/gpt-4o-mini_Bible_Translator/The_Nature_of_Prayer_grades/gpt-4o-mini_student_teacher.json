  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of prayer in a Christian context and effectively distinguished it from talking to a false god.

However, the student could enhance their answer by incorporating more direct comparison to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
