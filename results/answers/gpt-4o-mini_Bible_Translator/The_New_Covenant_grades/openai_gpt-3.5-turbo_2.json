  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the concept of God writing His law on the hearts of His people in the context of the New Covenant. It effectively addresses the concern by clearly articulating the transition from the external focus of the Old Testament law to the internal transformation brought about by the principles of the New Covenant. The response is well-supported by biblical references and demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological implications of this key aspect of Christian doctrine."
