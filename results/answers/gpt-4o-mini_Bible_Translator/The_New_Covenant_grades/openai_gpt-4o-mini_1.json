The explanation provided is thorough, well-supported by Biblical references, and incorporates key theological truths of the New Covenant, such as internalization of God's will, intimacy of relationship, empowerment through the Holy Spirit, universal access, and transformation of lives. The student effectively showcases how the concept of God writing His law on the hearts of His people signifies a profound shift in the way believers relate to and follow God in the New Covenant era."
