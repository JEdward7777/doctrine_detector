In New Testament theology, the concept of believers being glorified with Christ refers to the promise and reality of sharing in the divine glory and honor of Christ, particularly in the eschatological context. This glorification is closely tied to several key themes:

1. **Union with Christ**: Believers are said to be united with Christ through faith (Romans 6:5). This union signifies that, just as Christ was raised from the dead and glorified, believers participate in this same resurrection and future glorification. Paul emphasizes this in Romans 8:17, where he states that believers are "heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him."

2. **Eschatological Fulfillment**: The glorification of believers is also eschatological in nature. It points to the future reality when believers will be fully transformed and receive their glorified bodies, similar to Christ's resurrection body (1 Corinthians 15:42-44, Philippians 3:20-21). At the second coming of Christ, believers will receive this glory and be fully conformed to the image of Christ.

3. **Transformation and Holiness**: Glorification entails the completion of the sanctification process. In Romans 8:30, Paul mentions that those whom God predestines He also calls, justifies, and glorifies. This suggests that glorification is the culmination of God's work in the believer's life, where they are fully and finally made righteous and holy in His presence.

4. **Participation in Christ's Glory**: In the New Testament, believers are also called to reflect the glory of Christ in their lives on earth. This idea is encapsulated in passages like 2 Corinthians 3:18, where Paul writes that believers, "with unveiled faces," reflect the Lord's glory and are being transformed into his likeness. This reflects a present reality of living in light of the future glory that awaits.

5. **Hope and Assurance**: The promise of glorification serves as a source of hope and encouragement for believers. Romans 8:18 affirms that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to believers. This future hope sustains Christians in their trials and tribulations, reminding them of the ultimate victory they will share with Christ.

In summary, being glorified with Christ means that believers are assured of a future transformation into their final state of holiness and glory, sharing in Christâ€™s resurrection and being fully united with Him in eternal life. This concept encourages believers to live in a manner worthy of their calling, reflecting the character and glory of Christ in their daily lives.
