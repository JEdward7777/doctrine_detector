The answer effectively covers key aspects such as union with Christ, eschatological fulfillment, transformation and holiness, participation in Christ's glory, and hope and assurance. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses enhances the explanation and demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept. The answer could be strengthened by deepening the scriptural analysis and emphasizing the importance of Christ's work in believers' glorification."
