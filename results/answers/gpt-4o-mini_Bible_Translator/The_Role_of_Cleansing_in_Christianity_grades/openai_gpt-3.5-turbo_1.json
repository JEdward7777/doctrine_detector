The student effectively demonstrates how the sacrificial system in the Old Testament foreshadows and is fulfilled by Jesus' ultimate sacrifice for believers' cleansing from sin. The discussion on the importance of faith, ongoing repentance, and redemption in the process of cleansing is well articulated and aligns with a Christian worldview."
