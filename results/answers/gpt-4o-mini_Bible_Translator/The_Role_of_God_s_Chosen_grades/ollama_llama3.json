  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting God's sovereignty in appointing leaders like Moses and David, emphasizing His purpose and plans for leadership among His followers. The writer provides clear biblical examples to support their claims, using Exodus and 1 Samuel to illustrate God's selection process. They also provide insightful implications about God's attributes, such as grace, sovereignty, and an emphasis on the heart's condition.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more concise in its language and transitions between ideas. The writer provides a clear outline of their points, but some sentences feel slightly repetitive or wordy. Nevertheless, the overall content is strong, and the writer effectively demonstrates God's sovereignty in appointing leaders, making this a high-scoring response.\n\nGrade: 95"
