The inclusion of scriptural references and the detailed explanations of the roles and experiences of the apostles demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic. However, the answer could have been more focused on the core reason for the apostles' significance, as highlighted in the reference answer, which is their direct selection by Jesus to continue His teachings."
