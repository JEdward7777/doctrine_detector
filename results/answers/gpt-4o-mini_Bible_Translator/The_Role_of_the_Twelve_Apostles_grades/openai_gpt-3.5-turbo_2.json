It not only elaborates on their selection by Jesus and role in continuing His teachings but also delves into their foundational role in the early church, their firsthand witness to Jesus' ministry, their teaching and leadership responsibilities, the symbolic meaning behind their number, their diverse backgrounds, and their ultimate martyrdom and legacy. The response effectively addresses the concern raised and showcases a deep understanding of the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry from a Christian worldview."
