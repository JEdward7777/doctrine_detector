## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of the "spirit of antichrist" is primarily derived from the New Testament, particularly in the letters of John. Here are the key passages that address this topic:

1. **1 John 2:18**: "Children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour." This passage suggests that the presence of many antichrists is a sign of the end times.

2. **1 John 4:3**: "And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already." Here, the "spirit of the antichrist" is identified with any spirit or teaching that denies the divinity of Jesus Christ.

3. **2 John 1:7**: "For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist." This verse warns about deceivers who do not acknowledge the true nature of Christ.

In summary, the spirit of antichrist is characterized by opposition to Christ and His truth, leading people away from the fundamental Christian belief in Jesus as the incarnate Son of God. This spirit manifests in various forms throughout history and continues to influence thoughts and beliefs that are contrary to the teachings of Christianity.
