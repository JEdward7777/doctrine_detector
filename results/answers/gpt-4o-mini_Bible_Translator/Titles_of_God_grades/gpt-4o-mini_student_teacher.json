  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough answer showcasing various titles used in the Bible to refer to God as 'Almighty'. The references to El Shaddai, Pantokrator, Yahweh Sabaoth, and The Almighty demonstrate a good understanding of the question and the different aspects of God's character portrayed through these titles. However, the student missed the more direct titles mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher, such as 'Almighty God', 'God Almighty', 'Lord Almighty', and 'Lord God Almighty'. Encouraging the student to incorporate these specific titles would have enhanced the completeness of the response."
