## [Answer](../Titles_of_God.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, several titles refer to God as 'Almighty,' highlighting His supreme power and sovereignty. Here are some notable examples:

1. **El Shaddai** - This Hebrew term often translated as "God Almighty" emphasizes God's all-sufficient power and might. It appears in several places, such as Genesis 17:1 and Exodus 6:3.

2. **Pantokrator** - This Greek term, also meaning "Almighty" or "All-Powerful," is used in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Revelation (e.g., Revelation 1:8, Revelation 11:17).

3. **Yahweh Sabaoth** - Translated as "Lord of Hosts" or "Lord of Armies," this title signifies God's sovereignty over all heavenly and earthly armies, reflecting His almighty power.

4. **The Almighty** - This title is explicitly used in various Bible verses, such as Job 23:16 and Revelation 21:22, to emphasize God's supreme authority and power.

These titles reflect different aspects of God's character and His ability to exert authority over all creation.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a clear and thorough explanation of various titles that refer to God as "Almighty" in different languages, including Hebrew (El Shaddai) and Greek (Pantokrator). It also provides specific biblical references to support these titles. This demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and its relevance to our understanding of God's character.

However, the response does not fully address the concern, which is recognizing these titles can enhance our understanding of God's character. While it mentions that these titles reflect different aspects of God's character and His ability to exert authority over all creation, it could be more explicit in exploring how this recognition enhances our understanding of God's character.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the concept, but could benefit from a more deliberate exploration of how recognizing these titles can enhance our understanding of God's character.
