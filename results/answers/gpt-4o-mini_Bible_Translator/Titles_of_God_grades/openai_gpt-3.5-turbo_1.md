In the Bible, several titles refer to God as 'Almighty,' highlighting His supreme power and sovereignty. Here are some notable examples:

1. **El Shaddai** - This Hebrew term often translated as "God Almighty" emphasizes God's all-sufficient power and might. It appears in several places, such as Genesis 17:1 and Exodus 6:3.

2. **Pantokrator** - This Greek term, also meaning "Almighty" or "All-Powerful," is used in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Revelation (e.g., Revelation 1:8, Revelation 11:17).

3. **Yahweh Sabaoth** - Translated as "Lord of Hosts" or "Lord of Armies," this title signifies God's sovereignty over all heavenly and earthly armies, reflecting His almighty power.

4. **The Almighty** - This title is explicitly used in various Bible verses, such as Job 23:16 and Revelation 21:22, to emphasize God's supreme authority and power.

These titles reflect different aspects of God's character and His ability to exert authority over all creation.
