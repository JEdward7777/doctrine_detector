## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites ceased using the tabernacle primarily due to the establishment of the permanent Temple in Jerusalem. The tabernacle, a portable sanctuary, was used by the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness and into the Promised Land. It served as the dwelling place of God's presence and a center for worship, particularly before the Israelites settled in Canaan.

King David planned to build a permanent temple to replace the tabernacle, desiring a more stable and grand place for God's presence. Although David was not permitted to build the Temple because he was a man of war, his son Solomon eventually constructed it, which became the new focal point of worship for the Israelites (as documented in 2 Samuel 7 and 1 Kings 6). 

Once the Temple was completed and dedicated, it took over the role of the tabernacle in Israelite worship. The Temple was designed for more permanent use and symbolized God's enduring presence with His people in a definitive location, thus leading to the diminishing use of the tabernacle.
