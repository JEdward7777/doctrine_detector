  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a solid explanation of why the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle, emphasizing the transition to the permanent Temple in Jerusalem. The answer accurately references the biblical accounts of King David's plans and Solomon's construction of the Temple. The response effectively connects the significance of the Temple in replacing the tabernacle as the central place of worship for the Israelites. One suggestion for improvement could be to incorporate more specific biblical references to support the explanation further. Overall, a well-structured and doctrinally sound response."
