The examples given are relevant and well-explained, showing a strong grasp of the topic. However, the response could be further enhanced by incorporating more depth or explanation on the theological significance of the term \"El Shaddai\" in the Hebrew Bible and how it impacts the translation choices in different languages from a Christian worldview perspective."
