  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-organized response, showcasing their understanding of how \"El Shaddai\" can be translated into different languages. However, the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages was not fully addressed in the student's answer. The reference answer emphasizes maintaining the term as 'Shaddai' if necessary and considering the phonetics of the language, which the student did not mention. Overall, while the student provided valuable information on translations in various languages, there was a lack of alignment with the specific concern provided."
