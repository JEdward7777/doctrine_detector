The phrase "El Shaddai" is a Hebrew term often translated as "God Almighty" in many English Bible translations. The term conveys attributes of God's power and sufficiency.

2. **French**: In French translations, "El Shaddai" is often rendered as "Dieu Tout-Puissant," meaning "God Almighty."

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response does acknowledge that "El Shaddai" can be translated as "God Almighty" or kept in its original form, which is partially accurate. However, it lacks depth and understanding of the theological significance of the name "El Shaddai" and how different translations convey the attributes of God's power and sufficiency.

Furthermore, the response does not demonstrate a clear concern for ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages, as stated in the concern. It only briefly mentions that the spelling will depend on the phonetics of the language, which is a minor aspect of translation.

To improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more context about the meaning and significance of "El Shaddai" in biblical and theological contexts, as well as demonstrate a deeper understanding of how different translations can accurately convey the attributes of God's power and sufficiency while respecting cultural and linguistic nuances.
