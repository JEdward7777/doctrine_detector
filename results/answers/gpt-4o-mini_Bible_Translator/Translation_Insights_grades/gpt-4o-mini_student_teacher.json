  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out and comprehensive answer, offering various translations for the phrase \"image of God\" as it applies to humans and Jesus. They effectively discussed the theological significance of each translation and how it impacts perspectives on human dignity, Christology, ethics, and responsibility. However, the student could have tied their translations more closely to the nature of humanity's relation to God and Christ's divine nature, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
