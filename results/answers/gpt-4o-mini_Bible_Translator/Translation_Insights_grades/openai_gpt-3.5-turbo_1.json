The suggested translations for both humans and Jesus are well thought out and grounded in biblical references, showing a clear connection to Christian theology. The discussion on the theological implications of these translations is insightful and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern raised and offers a comprehensive analysis that encourages further reflection on the nature of humanity's relation to God and Christ's divine nature. Great job!"
