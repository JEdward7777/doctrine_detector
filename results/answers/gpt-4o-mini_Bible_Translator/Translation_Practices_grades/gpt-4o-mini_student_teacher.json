  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-reasoned and thorough explanation for why many Bible translations use \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh,\" taking into account Jewish tradition, respect and reverence for God's name, translation conventions, and contextual clarity. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concerns related to clarity in translation of sacred texts and maintaining reverence for God's name from a Christian worldview. The only slight deviation from the reference answer is the focus on the fear of mispronouncing 'Yahweh,' which is touched upon but not explicitly emphasized in the student's response. Overall, an excellent answer."
