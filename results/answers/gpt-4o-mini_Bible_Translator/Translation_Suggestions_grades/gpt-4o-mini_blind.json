  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-articulated response, offering a variety of alternative translations that effectively capture the biblical meaning of being zealous. The explanations provided for each translation help demonstrate a solid understanding of the nuances inherent in the concept. The inclusion of the biblical reference further strengthens the response. Great job in addressing the question from a Christian worldview perspective."
