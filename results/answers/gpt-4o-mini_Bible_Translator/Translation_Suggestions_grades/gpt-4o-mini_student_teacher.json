  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer with alternative translations that capture the biblical meaning of \"to be zealous.\" They effectively highlighted the intensity of commitment and passion expected in the Christian faith. While the student's list of alternative translations slightly differs from the teacher's reference answer, they still accurately conveyed the underlying concepts. Overall, a solid understanding and application of different translations in a Christian context were demonstrated. Great job!"
