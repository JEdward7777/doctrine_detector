The phrase "to be zealous" can be translated in various ways that reflect its biblical meaning, which often conveys a sense of fervor, passion, and dedication, particularly in relation to faith and good works. Here are some alternative translations that capture these nuances:

1. **To be passionate** - This translation emphasizes intense emotion and commitment.
2. **To be fervent** - This term suggests a burning intensity and eagerness in one's faith or actions.
3. **To be eager** - This conveys a sense of readiness and enthusiasm in pursuing righteousness or God's will.
4. **To strive diligently** - This translation reflects a strong effort and determination in serving God or fulfilling one's duties.
5. **To be devoted** - This captures the idea of loyalty and committed service to God or His purposes.
6. **To take action fervently** - This suggests an active and energetic pursuit of God's commands.

In the context of biblical passages, such as Romans 12:11 ("Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord"), these alternative translations can illuminate the original intent and meaning. Each translation can help convey the importance of a heartfelt and active faith in one's relationship with God and in the form of service to others.

I would grade this response an 80.

The student's answer provides some alternative translations for "to be zealous", including phrases that convey intensity of commitment, eagerness, and determination. While these translations are relevant to understanding the Christian faith, they could be more explicitly connected to the concern about grasping the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith.

The student's response does not fully address the concern, as it primarily focuses on providing alternative translations without explicitly linking them to the idea of intensifying one's commitment to God. The provided examples do not specifically highlight the importance of fervor, passion, and dedication in the Christian faith, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the concern.

To improve this response, the student could have explicitly linked each translation to the concept of intensifying one's commitment to God, providing biblical examples or illustrations that demonstrate how these translations can be applied in real-life situations. This would have strengthened the connection between the alternative translations and the concern about grasping the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith.
