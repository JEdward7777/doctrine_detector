The alternatives provided were relevant and insightful, broadening the scope of possible translations. The student effectively addressed the concern of exploring different interpretations of biblical terms to deepen understanding. Additionally, they acknowledged the theological context and variations in usage depending on specific biblical passages. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a solid grasp of the topic and contributed valuable insights."
