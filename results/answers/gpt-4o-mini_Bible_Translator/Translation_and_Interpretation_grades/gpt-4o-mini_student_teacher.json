  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of how the translation of 'Lord' differs in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people. They correctly highlighted the divine implications associated with the term when referring to God and the secular or social connotations when used for ordinary people. The summary effectively encapsulates the key points discussed in the answer. The student's response aligns well with the concern of how proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impact the understanding of scripture and the nature of God. The only minor discrepancy from the reference answer is the specific mention of capitalization when referring to God, which was not directly addressed in the student's response. Overall, a strong and well-informed answer."
