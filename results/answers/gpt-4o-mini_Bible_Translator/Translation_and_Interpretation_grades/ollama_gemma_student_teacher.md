## [Answer](../Translation_and_Interpretation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of biblical translation, the term "Lord" can carry different meanings and connotations depending on the context in which it is used, particularly when referring to God versus ordinary people.

1. **Referring to God**: When "Lord" is used to refer to God, it is often translated from the Hebrew "YHWH" (often rendered as "LORD" in all capital letters in many English translations) or "Adonai," and in the New Testament, it typically translates the Greek "Kyrios." In this context, "Lord" signifies God's sovereignty, authority, and divinity. It emphasizes His role as the creator, ruler, and sustainer of the universe. The usage conveys a sense of worship, reverence, and recognition of God's ultimate power and holiness.

2. **Referring to Ordinary People**: When "Lord" is used in reference to ordinary people, such as masters or lords in a societal context, it typically translates from terms like "Adon" in Hebrew or "Kyrios" in Greek when used in a secular or social context. In these situations, "Lord" implies authority or respect but lacks the divine implications associated with God. It may denote a position of power or leadership, such as a landowner or a nobleman, and is often used in relationships involving servitude or hierarchy.

### Summary

- **God**: "Lord" is used to denote divine authority, worship, and reverence.
- **Ordinary People**: "Lord" denotes authority or respect in a social or secular context, without the inherent attributes of divinity.

Understanding these distinctions helps readers appropriately interpret biblical passages, recognizing the profound difference between Godâ€™s lordship and the earthly authority represented by the term in other contexts.
