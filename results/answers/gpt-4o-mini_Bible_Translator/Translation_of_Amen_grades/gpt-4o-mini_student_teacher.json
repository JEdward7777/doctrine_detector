  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of potential translations of \"truly\" used by Jesus, demonstrating a strong understanding of biblical translation and interpretation. They accurately identified the Greek word \"\u1f00\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\" and offered relevant translations that capture the essence of Jesus' affirmation. The inclusion of various nuanced translations shows a deep engagement with the topic. However, the student missed the reference answer provided by the teacher, which could have further enriched their response. Overall, a well-researched and thoughtful answer deserving of a high grade."
