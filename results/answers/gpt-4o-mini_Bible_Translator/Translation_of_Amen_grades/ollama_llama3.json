  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response attempts to provide a general understanding of the phrase \"truly I tell you\" in the context of biblical translation, but it does not directly address the original question or concern about accurate biblical interpretation. While the response provides some useful information about the potential translations and meanings of this phrase, it does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. To improve, the response could focus more on the significance of accurate translation and how it relates to the original question."
