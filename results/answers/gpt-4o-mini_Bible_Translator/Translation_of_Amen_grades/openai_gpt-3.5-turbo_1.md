# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of phrases like "truly I tell you" (e.g., in the Gospels), the term "truly" is translated from the Greek word "ἀμήν" (amēn), which conveys a sense of affirmation or certainty. Here are some potential translations of "truly" as it might be used by Jesus:

1. **Verily** – An older English term that also conveys truthfulness and certainty.
2. **Certainly** – Indicates assurance in the statement being made.
3. **Indeed** – Confirms the truth of what is being stated.
4. **Honestly** – Emphasizes sincerity and genuineness in the declaration.
5. **Truly** – The most common and direct translation that communicates the intended meaning.
6. **Assuredly** – Similar to "certainly,” it conveys a strong sense of assurance.
7. **Without a doubt** – A more modern expression that stresses unquestionable truth.

Each translation captures the essence of Jesus' affirmation and the importance of the statements that follow, which often carry significant theological implications. In biblical translations, the choice of word might depend on the overall style and audience of the translation.
