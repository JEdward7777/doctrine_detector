  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of suggested translations for the term 'church' that reflect its meaning accurately. However, there is a concern regarding the accurate representation of the church's inclusive nature in translations, which the student did not fully address in their response. The teacher's reference answer specifically highlights the importance of translations that ensure the term refers to all believers and not just one small group. In this regard, the student's answer falls short as it focuses more on the different aspects of the church without explicitly addressing the concern of inclusivity."
