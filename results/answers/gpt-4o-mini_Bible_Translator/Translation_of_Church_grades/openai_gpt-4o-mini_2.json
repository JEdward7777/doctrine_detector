Each suggested term captures a different aspect of the church's meaning, reflecting the unity and diversity within the community of believers. The answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the concern regarding accurate representation of the church's inclusivity in translations and provides thoughtful alternatives that align with a Christian worldview. Great job!"
