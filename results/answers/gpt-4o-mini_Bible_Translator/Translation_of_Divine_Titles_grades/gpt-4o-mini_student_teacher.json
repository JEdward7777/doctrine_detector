  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response on translating the term \"Lord Yahweh\" into different languages while considering the significance of both names. They demonstrated a strong understanding of the importance of maintaining the sacredness and distinctiveness of the name in translations. However, the reference answer from the teacher focused on the grammatical structure in the target language, which the student did not address directly.Therefore, the grade could be higher if the student had incorporated the consideration of grammatical structure into their response."
