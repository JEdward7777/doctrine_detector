  "grade_comment": "Grade: 82\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the terms 'Hades' and 'Sheol' in their biblical contexts and offers suitable translation options. The student demonstrates an understanding of the nuances of these terms and suggests appropriate Bible translations for studying them. However, a higher grade could be achieved by incorporating more specific biblical references to illustrate the usage of 'Sheol' and 'Hades' in Scripture and by further emphasizing the distinctiveness of these concepts from modern understandings of heaven and hell. Additionally, highlighting the significance of these terms in conveying the biblical worldview of the afterlife would enhance the overall theological depth of the response."
