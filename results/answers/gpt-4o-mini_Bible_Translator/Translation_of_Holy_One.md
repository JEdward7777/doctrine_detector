The term "Holy One" can be translated into various languages while retaining its theological significance in Christianity. The translation often reflects the context in which it is used (e.g., referring to God, Jesus, or a saint). Here are some translations in different languages:

1. **Spanish**: "Santo" when referring to God, or "El Santo" for "Holy One."
   
2. **French**: "Saint" or "Le Saint."

3. **German**: "Der Heilige" when referring to God or Christ.

4. **Italian**: "Il Santo" when used for God or Christ.

5. **Portuguese**: "O Santo" for God or "Santo" depending on context.

6. **Russian**: "Святой" (Svyatoy), which means "Holy" or "Saint."

7. **Chinese (Simplified)**: "圣者" (Shèng zhě), meaning "Holy One."

8. **Arabic**: "القدوس" (Al-Quddus), which translates as "The Holy One."

9. **Hebrew**: "הַקָּדוֹשׁ" (HaKadosh), translating directly as "The Holy One," frequently used in reference to God.

These translations may vary slightly based on dialects or regional uses, but they all aim to convey the sanctity and set-apart nature associated with the term "Holy One" in Christian theology. When choosing a translation, context is vital, especially when it refers to Jesus or is used in worship or scripture.
