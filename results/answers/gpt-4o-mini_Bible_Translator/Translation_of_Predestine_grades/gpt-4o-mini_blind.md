The term "predestined" is commonly used in Christian theological contexts, particularly in discussions around concepts like salvation and Divine sovereignty. Here are some suggested translations and interpretations from various biblical translations and theological perspectives:

1. **New International Version (NIV)** - "Predestined" is used to convey the idea of God having predetermined a course or destiny for individuals or humanity (e.g., Romans 8:29).

2. **English Standard Version (ESV)** - Similar to the NIV, the ESV uses "predestined" in passages like Ephesians 1:5, which emphasizes God's sovereign choice in salvation.

3. **New American Standard Bible (NASB)** - This translation also uses "predestined" and tends to emphasize the theological nuances of God's foreknowledge and divine plan (e.g., Ephesians 1:11).

4. **King James Version (KJV)** - The KJV uses "predestinated" in Romans 8:29 and Ephesians 1:5, reflecting the historical use of the term in English theology.

5. **The Message (MSG)** - This paraphrased version may use more contemporary language, like "arranged in advance," to convey the concept of God's foreordained plan for individuals.

6. **New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)** - This translation also uses "predestined" and focuses on the theological implications of God's providential action.

In theological discussions, "predestined" often encompasses the ideas of God's foreknowledge, election, and the assurance of salvation. Different denominations may interpret this term in various waysâ€”ranging from Calvinistic views of unconditional election to Arminian perspectives emphasizing free will and God's foreknowledge.

Choosing an appropriate translation will depend on the theological context and the audience's understanding of these concepts.
