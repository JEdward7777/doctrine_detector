  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful answer that covers a wide range of considerations when translating the term 'Rabbi' into various languages. The response shows a deep understanding of the cultural, religious, linguistic, and contextual factors involved in this translation process. The student also addresses the importance of theological accuracy and ecumenical sensitivity, aligning well with the Christian concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly tie the considerations back to the concern of ensuring the accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching, which would further strengthen the connection to the Christian worldview."
