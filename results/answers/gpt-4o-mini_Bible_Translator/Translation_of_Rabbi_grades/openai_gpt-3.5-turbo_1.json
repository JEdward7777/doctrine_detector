  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to translating the term 'Rabbi' while ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. It covers key considerations such as cultural context, religious implications, audience understanding, and theological accuracy. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of respecting the title's significance and not diminishing Jesus' divine role. The only area that could be further emphasized is the theological aspect of ensuring the translation aligns with established Christian beliefs, possibly by providing more specific examples or explanations in that regard."
