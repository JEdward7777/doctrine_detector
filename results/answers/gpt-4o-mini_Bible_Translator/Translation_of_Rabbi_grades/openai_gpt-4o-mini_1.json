The considerations outlined encompass various aspects related to cultural, religious, linguistic, and theological factors. The emphasis on ensuring that the translation respects the significance of the title without diminishing Jesus' divine role as a teacher is commendable from a Christian worldview perspective. The response effectively balances the need for accuracy and sensitivity in portraying Jesus as more than just a schoolteacher while also acknowledging the importance of contextualizing the term for different audiences."
