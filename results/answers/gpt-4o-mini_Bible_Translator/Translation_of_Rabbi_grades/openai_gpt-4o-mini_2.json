  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-thought-out approach to translating the term 'Rabbi' into various languages, considering cultural, religious, phonetic, and audience-specific factors. It acknowledges the need to accurately represent Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith, while also respecting the significance of the term 'Rabbi'. The response effectively addresses the concern by ensuring that the translation aligns with established theological understandings within Christianity. The only potential area for improvement could be providing more explicit reference to how translations should reflect the unique divinity and authority of Jesus as the ultimate Rabbi within Christian belief. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response."
