  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and nuanced exploration of the biblical concept of \"ransom\" and its translation into various languages. It recognizes the importance of conveying the theological context and cultural resonance of the term, ensuring that it is accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. While the provided examples are thorough and thoughtful, there is room for improvement in explicitly linking the translations back to the original biblical principles. The response could benefit from a more direct explanation of how each translation maintains fidelity to the theological significance of the term \"ransom.\""
