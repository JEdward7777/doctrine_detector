  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and culturally sensitive exploration of translating the term \"ransom\" into various languages. It effectively addresses the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across different linguistic and cultural contexts. The suggestions for each language are well thought out and consider both the financial and sacrificial implications of the term, aligning with the Christian worldview. Additionally, the mention of providing explanations or footnotes when needed shows a commitment to maintaining fidelity to biblical principles. Overall, a strong and comprehensive response."
