  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively addresses the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts by providing thoughtful recommendations for translating the term \"ransom\" into various languages while emphasizing the theological nuances of liberation and sacrifice. The suggested translations align well with the biblical concept of ransom and demonstrate a strong understanding of the importance of maintaining fidelity to biblical principles in translation work. The inclusion of considerations for each language and the suggestion to provide explanations or footnotes where necessary further enhances the thoroughness of the response."
