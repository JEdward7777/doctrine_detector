  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, demonstrating an understanding of the importance of respecting and accurately translating titles in various cultural contexts. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' or a natural way of addressing a ruler in the target language, which the student did not include in their response. While the student's answer is informative and well-researched, it could have aligned more closely with the teacher's specified concern regarding biblical teachings."
