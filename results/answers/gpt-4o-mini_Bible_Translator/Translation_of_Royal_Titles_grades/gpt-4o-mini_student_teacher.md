## [Answer](../Translation_of_Royal_Titles.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The phrase "Your Majesty" is a formal way of addressing a sovereign or royal figure, and its translation can vary significantly across languages. Here are a few examples of how "Your Majesty" can be translated:

1. **Spanish**: "Su Majestad"
2. **French**: "Votre Majesté"
3. **German**: "Ihre Majestät"
4. **Italian**: "Vostra Maestà"
5. **Portuguese**: "Sua Majestade"
6. **Russian**: "Ваше Величество" (Vashe Velichestvo)
7. **Chinese (Simplified)**: "阁下" (Géxià) or "陛下" (Bìxià)
8. **Japanese**: "陛下" (Heika)
9. **Arabic**: "جلالتك" (Jalalatik)
10. **Hebrew**: "אדוני המלך" (Adoni HaMelech - "My Lord the King")

Each translation retains the respect and honor inherent in the original English phrase. When addressing royalty, context, formality, and the specific cultural practice of address all play a crucial role in the appropriate choice of words.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of translations for "Your Majesty" in different languages, demonstrating an understanding of the importance of respecting and accurately translating titles in various cultural contexts. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' or a natural way of addressing a ruler in the target language, which the student did not include in their response. While the student's answer is informative and well-researched, it could have aligned more closely with the teacher's specified concern regarding biblical teachings.
