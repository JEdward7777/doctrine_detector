The phrase "Your Majesty" is a formal way of addressing a sovereign or royal figure, and its translation can vary significantly across languages. Here are a few examples of how "Your Majesty" can be translated:

1. **Spanish**: "Su Majestad"
2. **French**: "Votre Majesté"
3. **German**: "Ihre Majestät"
4. **Italian**: "Vostra Maestà"
5. **Portuguese**: "Sua Majestade"
6. **Russian**: "Ваше Величество" (Vashe Velichestvo)
7. **Chinese (Simplified)**: "阁下" (Géxià) or "陛下" (Bìxià)
8. **Japanese**: "陛下" (Heika)
9. **Arabic**: "جلالتك" (Jalalatik)
10. **Hebrew**: "אדוני המלך" (Adoni HaMelech - "My Lord the King")

Each translation retains the respect and honor inherent in the original English phrase. When addressing royalty, context, formality, and the specific cultural practice of address all play a crucial role in the appropriate choice of words.
