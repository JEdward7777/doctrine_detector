## [Answer](../Translation_of_Royal_Titles.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The phrase "Your Majesty" is a formal way of addressing a sovereign or royal figure, and its translation can vary significantly across languages. Here are a few examples of how "Your Majesty" can be translated:

1. **Spanish**: "Su Majestad"
2. **French**: "Votre Majesté"
3. **German**: "Ihre Majestät"
4. **Italian**: "Vostra Maestà"
5. **Portuguese**: "Sua Majestade"
6. **Russian**: "Ваше Величество" (Vashe Velichestvo)
7. **Chinese (Simplified)**: "阁下" (Géxià) or "陛下" (Bìxià)
8. **Japanese**: "陛下" (Heika)
9. **Arabic**: "جلالتك" (Jalalatik)
10. **Hebrew**: "אדוני המלך" (Adoni HaMelech - "My Lord the King")

Each translation retains the respect and honor inherent in the original English phrase. When addressing royalty, context, formality, and the specific cultural practice of address all play a crucial role in the appropriate choice of words.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the original answer does mention that "Your Majesty" can be translated into other forms of address, it doesn't provide specific examples or nuances in different languages, which is what makes this response stand out. The concern about ensuring accurate and respectful translations of titles in biblical teachings is also not directly addressed in the original answer.

In contrast, this response provides a detailed list of how "Your Majesty" can be translated across various languages, showing a deep understanding of cultural differences and respect for different forms of address. This level of specificity and attention to detail demonstrates a high level of competence in ensuring accurate and respectful translations of titles.

However, I deduct points because the response could have been even stronger if it had explicitly connected the translations to biblical teachings or emphasized the importance of respecting cultural differences when addressing royalty in a Christian context. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a clear understanding of the complexity involved in translating titles across languages and cultures.
