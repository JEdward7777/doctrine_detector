  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, demonstrating a good understanding of cultural nuances and linguistic considerations. While the original answer suggests using a natural way of addressing a ruler in the target language, the additional information on formal translations provided in the graded response enhances accuracy and respect in the context of biblical teachings, which emphasize honoring authority and showing proper respect. Overall, the response aligns well with Christian values of honoring and respecting those in positions of authority."
