  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-thought-out response regarding the translation of the term \"sanctuary\" in modern texts, considering various important factors such as contextual meaning, cultural sensitivity, theological implications, historical usage, consistency with Scripture, linguistic nuances, and clarification of concepts. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of maintaining the original Biblical meaning of the term \"sanctuary.\" While they covered the theological significance and historical usage, the reference answer specifically emphasized the importance of ensuring the term reflects its Biblical definition as a holy and sacred place. Therefore, the student's response, while comprehensive, could have been more focused on the specific concern provided."
