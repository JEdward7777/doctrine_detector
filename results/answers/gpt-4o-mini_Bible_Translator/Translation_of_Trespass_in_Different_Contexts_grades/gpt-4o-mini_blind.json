  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a well-thought-out response that effectively analyzes the implications of translating \"trespass\" as \"sin\" or \"breaking the rule\" within a church community. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of theological concepts related to sin, grace, relationships, community restoration, accountability, discipleship, and church discipline. The connections to relevant biblical principles are also well articulated. Great job overall."
