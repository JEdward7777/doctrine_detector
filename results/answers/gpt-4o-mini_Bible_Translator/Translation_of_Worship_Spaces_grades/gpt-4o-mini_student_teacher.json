  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80. \n\nThe student's response provides a clear and thoughtful analysis of how to best translate the phrase \"house of Yahweh\" for contemporary understanding. They consider both the literal and theological significance of the term, offering various translation options to convey the meaning adequately to different audiences. While the student's suggestions align well with a Christian worldview in conveying the importance of worship spaces and God's presence, they could have tied their suggestions more explicitly to the significance of the term 'house of Yahweh'. The reference answer does a slightly better job at emphasizing the presence of Yahweh in the translated phrase."
