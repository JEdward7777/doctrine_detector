1. **"You shall name him..."** - This phrasing emphasizes a command or directive.
2. **"You are to give him the name..."** - This highlights the action of naming as an instruction.
3. **"His name shall be called..."** - This focuses on the significance of the name itself.
4. **"You will call him..."** - This presents the action as a future event that will happen.
5. **"You are to call his name..."** - This conveys the command directly and clearly.
