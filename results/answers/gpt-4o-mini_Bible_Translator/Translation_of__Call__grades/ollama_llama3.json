  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe student's response is correct that the phrase \"You must call his name\" can also be translated as 'you must name him,' emphasizing the act of assigning a name. However, I deduct some points because the student does not fully explore the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation. The response only mentions translation options without providing any depth or analysis on how these variations affect the interpretation of the text.\n\nThe provided comment is also brief and lacks specific examples or supporting evidence from Scripture to illustrate their point. A more detailed and well-supported explanation would have earned a higher grade.\n\nThat being said, the student does demonstrate an understanding of the different possible translations and renderings of the phrase, which shows some appreciation for the nuances of biblical language. Overall, it's a good start, but could be improved with more in-depth analysis and application to biblical interpretation."
