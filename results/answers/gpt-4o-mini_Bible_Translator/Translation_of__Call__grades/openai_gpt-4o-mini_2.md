In a biblical context, the phrase "You must call his name" is found in passages like Matthew 1:21, where the angel instructs Joseph about naming Jesus. Here are some alternative translations and renderings of that phrase:

1. **"You shall name him..."** - This phrasing emphasizes a command or directive.
2. **"You are to give him the name..."** - This highlights the action of naming as an instruction.
3. **"His name shall be called..."** - This focuses on the significance of the name itself.
4. **"You will call him..."** - This presents the action as a future event that will happen.
5. **"You are to call his name..."** - This conveys the command directly and clearly.
6. **"Name him..."** - A more succinct command that conveys the same idea.

Depending on the translation and the context, the specific wording may vary, but they all convey the essential meaning of the divine instruction regarding the naming of Jesus.
