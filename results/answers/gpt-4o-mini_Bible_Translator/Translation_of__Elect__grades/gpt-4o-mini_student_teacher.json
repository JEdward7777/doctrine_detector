  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive overview of how the translation of \"elect\" has evolved from older to modern English Bible versions and the potential impacts on theological understanding. They effectively analyze the differences between older and modern translations, discuss theological implications, accessibility, and contextual understanding. The response could be enhanced by directly addressing the concern raised, which is clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God, to establish a stronger connection between the content of the answer and the specific concern provided."
