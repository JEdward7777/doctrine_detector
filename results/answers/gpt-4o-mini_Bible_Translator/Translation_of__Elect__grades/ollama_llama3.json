  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God, specifically highlighting how different translations of the term \"elect\" can impact understanding. The writer provides a clear overview of older and modern translations, explaining how their language choices can affect theological understanding.\n\nThe response also attempts to bridge the gap between historical and contemporary understandings by noting the potential implications of using more accessible language in modern translations. However, there are some areas for improvement:\n\n* While the response generally stays focused on the concern, it could delve deeper into the biblical texts themselves to further illustrate the significance of being chosen by God.\n* The discussion could benefit from a clearer articulation of how the concept of being chosen relates to Christian identity and practice.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. With some refinement to address these areas, it has the potential to be even more effective in clarifying the meaning of biblical texts related to being chosen by God."
