  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough list of translation suggestions for the term \"beloved\" based on different contexts of love, especially considering biblical and theological texts. The suggestions are thoughtful and align well with the deep emotional and relational significance that the term \"beloved\" carries. The student could have strengthened the answer by providing a bit more explanation or examples of where each suggested translation could be used in a biblical or theological context. Overall, this is a solid response."
