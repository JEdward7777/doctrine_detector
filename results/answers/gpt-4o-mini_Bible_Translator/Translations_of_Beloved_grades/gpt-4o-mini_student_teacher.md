1. **Agape** - This is the Greek word for selfless, unconditional love. It could be used to emphasize the divine love aspect of the term "beloved."

2. **Dearly Loved** - This phrase emphasizes affection and warmth, making it relatable while retaining the original sentiment of "beloved."

3. **Favorite** - In contexts that highlight special chosen status (like God's people), "favorite" may convey a sense of privilege and care.

When translating "beloved," it’s essential to consider the context (whether it is addressing God’s love for humanity, the relationship among believers, or romantic love) to appropriately convey the original meaning. Each of these suggestions can help to capture the nuanced meanings behind "beloved" across various passages.
