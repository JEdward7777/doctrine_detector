## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Distinguishing between a true prophet of God and a false prophet is an important aspect of Christian discernment. Here are some key criteria based on biblical teachings:

1. **Consistency with Scripture**: A true prophet will always align with the teachings of the Bible. Deuteronomy 18:21-22 instructs that if a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord and their prophecy does not come to pass, that prophet is not sent by God. Additionally, their teachings should be consistent with scripture (Isaiah 8:20).

2. **Character and Fruit**: Jesus teaches that you will know them by their fruits (Matthew 7:16-20). A true prophet will demonstrate the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) in their life, such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Their character should reflect Christ.

3. **Glorification of God, Not Self**: True prophets will point to God and not themselves. Their messages should glorify God and lead others toward Him, not promote their own agenda or desires (John 16:13-14).

4. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**: As mentioned earlier, true prophecies will come to pass. The accuracy of their predictions is a significant indicator (Jeremiah 28:9).

5. **Confirmation by the Community**: Often, the recognition of a true prophet comes through the affirmation of a community of believers (1 Corinthians 14:29). This includes discernment by church leaders and the broader body of Christ.

6. **Motivation and Message**: True prophets will often endure suffering and persecution for their messages, rather than seeking wealth, fame, or power (2 Timothy 3:12). Their messages should call for repentance and alignment with Godâ€™s will.

7. **Revelation and Insight**: A true prophet receives revelation from God and has insight that aligns with His will, especially regarding spiritual matters and the condition of the heart (Ephesians 4:11-13).

In summary, discernment is crucial. Believers are encouraged to pray for wisdom and guidance and to be rooted in the study of Scripture to effectively evaluate the messages and the lives of those who claim to be prophets.
