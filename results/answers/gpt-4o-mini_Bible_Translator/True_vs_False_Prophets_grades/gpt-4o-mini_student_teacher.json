  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that aligns with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student effectively incorporates relevant biblical teachings and principles to distinguish true prophets from false prophets. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused on the core aspects of discerning true prophetic voices, rather than delving into extensive details for each criterion. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on discerning true prophets."
