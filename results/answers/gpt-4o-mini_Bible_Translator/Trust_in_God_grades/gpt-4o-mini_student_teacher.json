  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response highlighting the distinctions between hope in God and wishful thinking. The answer effectively connects Christian teachings on hope, faith, assurance, action, endurance, and eternal perspective. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern without excessive elaboration on each point. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
