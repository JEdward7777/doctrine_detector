  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the different forms of love within the biblical context. The student has effectively highlighted key aspects of agape, philia, eros, and storge love, supported by relevant Scriptures. The integration of the central theme of God's selfless love as the foundation for all forms of love is commendable. The response could be enhanced by further elaborating on how each form of love aligns with specific teachings or examples from the Bible to deepen the doctrinal connection. Overall, a strong and insightful analysis."
