## [Answer](../Types_of_Love.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, love is a fundamental theme that is multifaceted and expressed in various forms, each with unique nuances yet deeply connected to the overarching principle of selflessness and care for others. Below are some key forms of love found in the Scriptures:

1. **Agape Love**: This is often described as unconditional love, the highest form of love exemplified by God's love for humanity. It is selfless, sacrificial, and seeks the good of others without expecting anything in return. John 3:16 illustrates this with God's love for the world, culminating in the sacrifice of Jesus.

2. **Philia**: Commonly translated as "brotherly love," Philia reflects deep friendship, loyalty, and companionship. It signifies a bond formed through shared experiences and a mutual commitment to one another. In Matthew 22:39, Jesus commands us to "love your neighbor as yourself," which aligns with this form of love.

3. **Eros**: Although the term "eros" may not appear directly in canonical texts, it represents romantic love. This form of love encompasses desire, passion, and intimacy, particularly within the context of marriage. The Song of Solomon vividly portrays the beauty and sacredness of erotic love within the covenant of marriage.

4. **Storge**: This term refers to familial love, the natural affection that often exists between family members. It embodies the bond between parents and children and the love inherent in family relationships. While not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament, its implications are evident in passages that speak about caring for one's family (e.g., 1 Timothy 5:8).

The biblical definition of love transcends these forms by grounding them in the character of God, who is love (1 John 4:8). All forms of love should reflect God's nature, promoting unity, reconciliation, and support among individuals.

Ultimately, these types of love are interconnected and should be expressed in harmony with one another. For Christians, the expression of love—whether brotherly, romantic, or familial—must be aligned with the principles of the Gospel, emphasizing sacrifice, humility, and service to others.
