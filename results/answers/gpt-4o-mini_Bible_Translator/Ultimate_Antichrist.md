## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the book of Revelation, the figure often identified as the ultimate antichrist is the "Beast." Specifically, Revelation 13 describes a beast that rises from the sea, which is traditionally interpreted as representing a powerful and malevolent force opposed to God and His people. This figure is sometimes associated with the final opposition to Christ, culminating in the end times. Additionally, in Revelation 20:10, this beast is thrown into the lake of fire, symbolizing its ultimate defeat. Many theologians and commentators also interpret the concept of the antichrist more broadly, viewing it as a representation of various forces and figures throughout history that oppose Christ and His teachings.
