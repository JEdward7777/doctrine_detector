  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and comprehensive response that effectively identifies various actions and practices that the Bible identifies as abominations to God. The student demonstrates a deep understanding of relevant biblical passages and clearly articulates the principle that actions that lead to injustice, unfaithfulness, and deviation from God's commands are considered abominations. The inclusion of historical and cultural context adds depth to the analysis."
