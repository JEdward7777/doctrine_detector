## [Answer](../Understanding_Abomination.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible outlines several actions and practices that are described as abominations to God, primarily in the Old Testament. Here are some key examples:

1. **Idolatry**: Worshipping other gods or idols is a central abomination. In Exodus 20:3-5, God commands against having other gods before Him and making any graven images.

2. **Homosexual Practices**: Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13 explicitly label male homosexual acts as abominations.

3. **Injustice and Oppression**: Proverbs 6:16-19 lists several things that God hates, including a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, and those who sow discord among brethren. Social injustices and exploitation of the poor often fall into this category as well.

4. **Improper Worship Practices**: In Deuteronomy 12:31, the Israelites are warned against adopting the abominable practices of the nations around them, such as child sacrifice and other ritualistic activities that dishonor God.

5. **Divination and Sorcery**: Practices such as witchcraft, fortune-telling, and consulting mediums are considered abominations in Deuteronomy 18:10-12.

6. **Dishonest Business Practices**: Proverbs 11:1 highlights that a false balance is an abomination to the Lord, indicating that dishonest trading practices are not acceptable.

7. **Misuse of Sexuality**: Beyond homosexual acts, other forms of sexual immorality, including adultery and incest, are also described as abominable practices in the context of God's design for marriage and sexuality.

These practices indicate a broader principle in Scripture: actions that lead to injustice, unfaithfulness, and a deviation from Godâ€™s commands are considered abominations in His sight. Understanding these passages requires careful theological reflection and consideration of the historical and cultural context in which they were written.
