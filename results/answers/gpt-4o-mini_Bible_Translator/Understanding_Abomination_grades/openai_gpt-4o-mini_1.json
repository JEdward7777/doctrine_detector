The incorporation of specific Bible verses strengthens the argument and demonstrates a solid knowledge of scripture. The response could be further enhanced by delving into the theological implications of these abominations and how Christians are called to respond to them in their daily lives. Overall, a well-informed and well-structured answer in alignment with the concern presented."
