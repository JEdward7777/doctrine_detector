Ephesians 1:5 states, "He predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will." This verse speaks to a profound theological concept in Christianity regarding what it means to be adopted as a child of God.

To be adopted as a child of God means that believers are brought into a special relationship with God, characterized by intimacy, belonging, and inheritance. Here are a few key points to consider:

1. **Identity and Belonging**: Adoption signifies a new identity. Believers are no longer defined by their past or their sin, but as children of God. This new identity comes with a sense of belonging to God's family.

2. **Intimacy with God**: As adopted children, believers can approach God as their Father. This relationship is intimate and personal, implying that God cares for them deeply, just like a loving parent.

3. **Inheritance**: In the Roman culture of the time, an adopted child could inherit just as a biological child could. This concept signifies that believers are co-heirs with Christ, meaning they share in the spiritual blessings and promises of God, including eternal life and the hope of glory.

4. **Predestination and God’s Will**: The verse also highlights the divine initiative in adoption. The act of adoption is not based on human merit but is according to God’s pleasure and will. It emphasizes that God chose to adopt those who believe in Christ, reflecting His grace and sovereignty.

5. **Through Jesus Christ**: The means of this adoption is through Jesus Christ. It underscores the necessity of faith in Christ for this relationship to exist. Christ’s work of redemption is central to believers' status as children of God.

In summary, Ephesians 1:5 encapsulates the gracious act of God in adopting believers into His family, granting them a new identity, intimate relationship with Him, a shared inheritance with Christ, and emphasizing that this is all part of His divine plan and grace.
