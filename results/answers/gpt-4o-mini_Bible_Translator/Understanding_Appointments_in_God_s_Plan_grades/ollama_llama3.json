  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately conveys the idea that being \"appointed to eternal life\" means being chosen by God for salvation, highlighting both divine sovereignty and grace. The mention of God's purpose and will is also in line with Christian theology on the topic. Additionally, the response briefly touches on the implications of this concept, such as emphasizing faith, grace, and God's sovereignty.\n\nThe only areas where the response could improve are in terms of depth and supporting biblical evidence. While the response correctly references divine selection and grace, it could delve deeper into the theological implications and provide more explicit connections to specific biblical passages or themes (e.g., predestination, election). Nonetheless, this response effectively clarifies the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" within a Christian framework.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept and its connection to Christian theology. To take it to the next level, consider incorporating more specific biblical references or theological nuances to further illustrate the idea."
