It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the central role of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology and provides thorough explanations supported by relevant biblical references. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the concept of the resurrection as crucial to the efficacy of Christ's atonement, reinforcing the foundation for salvation and eternal life for believers."
