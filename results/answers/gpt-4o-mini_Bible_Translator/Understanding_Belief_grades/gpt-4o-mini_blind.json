  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student\u2019s response provides a clear and insightful explanation of the difference between believing in something and believing someone, particularly in a theological context. They accurately highlight the importance of trust in relationship to a person's character when believing someone, and they effectively apply this distinction to Christianity. The explanation is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. The only improvement would be to further emphasize the centrality of relationship and personal connection in believing someone in a Christian worldview."
