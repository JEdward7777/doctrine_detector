# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the phrase "his name is called John" can be found in the context of the birth of John the Baptist, particularly in Luke 1:63, where Zechariah, the father of John, is asked what the child's name will be. The use of "is called" emphasizes the act of naming as an important cultural and theological event.

Within the biblical context, names often carry significant meaning. They can reflect characteristics, divine purpose, or the circumstances surrounding a person’s birth. In the case of John, the name means "Yahweh is gracious" or "the Lord is gracious." This naming reflects not only the unique role that John would play in salvation history—as the forerunner to Christ—but also the grace of God evident in the miraculous circumstances of his birth, as both his parents were advanced in age.

The importance of naming in the Bible can also be seen through other figures, such as Jesus being named ‘Jesus’ (meaning “the Lord saves”), which signifies his mission of salvation. Therefore, the naming of John is not just a trivial detail; it points to his identity and the purpose God has for him, emphasizing the theology of God's grace and the prophetic significance of his life and ministry.
