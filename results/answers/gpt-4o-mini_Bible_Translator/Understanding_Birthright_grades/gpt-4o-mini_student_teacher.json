  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob, covering aspects such as spiritual significance, consequences for future generations, Jacob's acquisition of the birthright, and character complexities. The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the significance of choices and their spiritual consequences within a Christian context. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly connecting their analysis to the specific concern provided and focusing on the core spiritual implications highlighted in the teacher's reference answer."
