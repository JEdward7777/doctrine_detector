The student effectively references key Old Testament and New Testament examples and scriptures to support their explanations. The emphasis on both moral conduct and the transformative work of Christ showcases a comprehensive understanding of the topic. One potential improvement could be to further elaborate on the significance of Christ's atonement in achieving blamelessness before God."
