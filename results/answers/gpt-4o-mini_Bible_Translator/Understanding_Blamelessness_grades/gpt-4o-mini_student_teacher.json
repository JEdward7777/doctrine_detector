  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer. The student effectively addressed the concern of distinguishing between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context by emphasizing the importance of living faithfully according to God's standards and relying on the grace of Jesus Christ. There is clear understanding of the biblical references and theological implications of being blameless before God. Great job!"
