  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student has demonstrated a sound knowledge of biblical implications of speaking against God or others and has provided substantial scriptural references to support their points. They have also highlighted the seriousness of blasphemy in both the Old and New Testaments and the implications it carries in terms of judgment, accountability, impact on relationships, and the need for repentance. The student's practical application section is also well thought out and applicable to everyday Christian living.\n\nHowever, the student's response could be improved by directly incorporating the teacher's definition of blasphemy into their explanation to enhance clarity and alignment with the question. Additionally, the student could have further emphasized the importance of avoiding disrespectful speech and behavior by Christians as per the concern provided."
