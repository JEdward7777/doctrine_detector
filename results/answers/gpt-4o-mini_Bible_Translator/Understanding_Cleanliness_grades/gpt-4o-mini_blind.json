  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean' in both the Old and New Testaments, connecting them to moral purity and holiness. The student accurately relates the ceremonial and moral implications of cleanliness, provides Scriptural references, and emphasizes the importance of heart transformation and community responsibility. However, the response could have further elaborated on the theological significance of Jesus' teachings on purity and how they relate to the broader understanding of moral purity in Christianity. Overall, a solid and insightful exploration of the topic."
