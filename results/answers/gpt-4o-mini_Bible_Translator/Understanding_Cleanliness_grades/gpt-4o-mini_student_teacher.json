  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively explores how the biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean' provide insight into moral purity, covering both the Old and New Testaments and emphasizing the importance of moral purity over mere ritual observance. The response engages with relevant scripture passages and demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of cleanliness in a spiritual context. The connection between cleanliness and holiness, as well as the communal aspect of maintaining moral purity, is well articulated. The only area of improvement could be a stronger emphasis on how these definitions specifically guide believers in their personal and communal lives, as highlighted in the concern provided."
