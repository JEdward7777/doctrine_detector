  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean,' effectively demonstrating how these concepts go beyond physical states to symbolize moral purity and spiritual cleanliness. The inclusion of Old and New Testament perspectives, as well as the emphasis on moral implications, community responsibility, and holiness, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The conclusion effectively ties together the themes discussed throughout the response. The only minor suggestion would be to perhaps include a brief application section on how believers can practically apply these principles of spiritual cleanliness in their personal and communal lives."
