  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student demonstrated a solid understanding of the passages in 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16, providing insightful explanations and theological reflections. The explanation of God's greater knowledge and mercy in 1 John 3:20 was well articulated, and the contrast between Adam's sin and the gift of justification through Christ in Romans 5:16 was effectively highlighted. The answer effectively emphasized the themes of condemnation, grace, and redemption found in the Bible. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning the role of Christ's sacrifice on the cross in bearing the condemnation for our sins and securing our justification before God."
