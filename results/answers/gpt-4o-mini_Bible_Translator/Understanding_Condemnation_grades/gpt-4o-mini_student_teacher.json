  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough analysis of the concept of condemnation as referenced in 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16, highlighting the internal struggles believers may face and the contrasting outcomes of condemnation and grace. However, the answer could have been improved by directly stating the central teaching from the Bible regarding condemnation, which is that through Christ, there is no condemnation for those who believe in Him. This key point was not explicitly mentioned in the student's answer."
