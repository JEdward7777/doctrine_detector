The student effectively integrates relevant scriptures and Christian principles to address the concern about aligning our words with God's teachings. The connection between cursing, moral inconsistency, impact on community, spiritual consequences, accountability, and the call to bless others is well articulated with solid scriptural support. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on the use of words and their alignment with God's teachings. Great job!"
