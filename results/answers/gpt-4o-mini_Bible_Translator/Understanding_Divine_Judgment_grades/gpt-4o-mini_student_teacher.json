They have referenced relevant Bible verses to support their points and have highlighted key differences between the two forms of judgment. The inclusion of the aspect of grace and mercy in God's judgment adds depth to the discussion. Overall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
