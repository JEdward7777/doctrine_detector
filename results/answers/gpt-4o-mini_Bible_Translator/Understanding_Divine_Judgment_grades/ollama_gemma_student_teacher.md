## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible speaks extensively about God's judgment, emphasizing its righteousness, thoroughness, and eternal implications. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Nature of God's Judgment**: 
   - **Righteousness**: God's judgment is inherently just. In Psalm 89:14, it is said, "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne." This suggests that God's judgments are based on perfect moral principles.
   - **Omniscience**: Unlike human judgment, which is often limited and flawed, God's understanding encompasses all things. Hebrews 4:13 states, "Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight; everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account."

2. **Scope**: 
   - God's judgment looks at the heart and motives behind actions. While humans can only observe external behavior, God sees the intentions behind those actions. 1 Samuel 16:7 makes this clear: "For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart."

3. **Eternal Judgment**: 
   - The Bible speaks of a final judgment where all will stand before God to account for their lives. In Revelation 20:12, it is described that the dead are judged according to what they have done. This eternal aspect of judgment is a significant difference from human judgment, which often has temporal effects.

4. **Human Judgment**:
   - Human judgment can be biased, subjective, and often influenced by personal feelings or external circumstances. It can lead to unfair treatment or misinterpretation of a person's actions. As stated in Matthew 7:1-2, Jesus cautions against passing judgment, highlighting that the measure we use will be used against us.
   - Human judgment is also limited by context and understanding, leading to potential errors. In contrast, God's judgment is impartial and based on absolute truth.

5. **Grace and Mercy**: 
   - God's judgment is also intertwined with His grace and mercy. While He is a righteous judge, He is also a compassionate God who desires repentance and reconciliation. This is evident in passages like 2 Peter 3:9, which indicates that God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.

In summary, God's judgment is characterized by righteousness, omniscience, and eternal significance, setting it apart from human judgment, which can be flawed, biased, and limited in scope. The Bible invites believers to trust in God's ultimate justice and to be mindful of their own tendencies to judge others superficially.
