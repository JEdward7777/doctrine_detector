  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of God's judgment as portrayed in the Bible, emphasizing the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the key differences between God's righteousness, omniscience, and eternal judgment compared to the limitations and biases present in human judgment. The integration of relevant Bible verses enhances the explanation and reinforces the Christian worldview perspective. Great job overall."
