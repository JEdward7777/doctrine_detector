  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive understanding of God's perfect judgment and contrasts it effectively with flawed human judgment. It incorporates key biblical references and emphasizes the righteousness, omniscience, and eternal implications of God's judgment. The explanation on how human judgment can be biased and limited is clear and supported by relevant passages. Additionally, the mention of grace and mercy in God's judgment adds depth to the analysis. Overall, an excellent job in addressing the concern with a Christian worldview."
