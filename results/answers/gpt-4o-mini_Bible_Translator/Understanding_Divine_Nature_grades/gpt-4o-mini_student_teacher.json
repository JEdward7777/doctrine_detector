  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nComment:\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the term 'divine nature' by highlighting various attributes of God such as holiness, omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, love, justice, mercy, and grace. The student's response effectively conveys the significance of God's characteristics in shaping His interactions with creation and humanity. However, there is a slight deviation from the provided reference answer in terms of brevity and focus. The student could improve by succinctly summarizing the key attributes without delving into such individual facets."
