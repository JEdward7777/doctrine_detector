## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible presents the concept of eternal life as a gift from God, which can be received through faith in Jesus Christ. Here are several key points related to inheriting eternal life according to Scripture:

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: The New Testament emphasizes that eternal life is available through belief in Jesus. For example, John 3:16 states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

2. **Grace, Not Works**: Ephesians 2:8-9 explains that eternal life is a result of God’s grace and cannot be earned through human efforts: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."

3. **Repentance**: The concept of repentance is also important. Acts 2:38 says, "Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'" A turning away from sin is part of receiving God’s gift of eternal life.

4. **Following Christ**: Jesus teaches that being His follower is essential. In John 10:27-28, He says, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand."

5. **The Role of the Holy Spirit**: The Holy Spirit plays a vital role in the life of believers and in securing eternal life. Romans 8:16 states, "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children."

6. **Perseverance**: The Bible also teaches that those who have genuine faith will persevere in that faith. In Matthew 24:13, Jesus says, "But the one who stands firm to the end will be saved."

7. **Inheritance of Eternal Life**: Inheriting the kingdom of God, which includes eternal life, is also mentioned. For example, in Matthew 25:34, the King (representing Jesus) will say to the righteous, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world."

In summary, inheriting eternal life, according to the Bible, involves faith in Jesus Christ, accepting God's grace, repenting from sin, and following Him throughout one’s life. The gift of eternal life is both a present reality for believers and a future hope that will be fully realized in eternity.
