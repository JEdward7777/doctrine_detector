The explanation aligns well with Christian beliefs and addresses the concern about the crucial aspect of eternity and attaining eternal life for spiritual assurance. The only slight deduction is that the response could have further emphasized the exclusive role of faith in Jesus Christ rather than implying inheritance of eternal life through obeying God's laws."
