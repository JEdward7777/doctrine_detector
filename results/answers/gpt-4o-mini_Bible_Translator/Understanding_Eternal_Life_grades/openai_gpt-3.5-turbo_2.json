However, the response does not directly address the concern raised about the importance of understanding how to attain eternal life for spiritual assurance. The emphasis on obeying God's laws is not in line with the Christian view that eternal life is received through faith in Jesus Christ and God's grace, not solely through obedience to laws. Therefore, while the response is informative, it falls short in directly addressing the concern from a Christian perspective."
