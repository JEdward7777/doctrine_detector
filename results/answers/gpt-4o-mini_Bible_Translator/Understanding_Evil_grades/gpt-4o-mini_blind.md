The distinction between 'evil' and 'wickedness' in the Bible can be subtle and is often context-dependent, but both terms capture aspects of moral failure and wrongdoing.

1. **Evil**: In biblical terms, 'evil' generally refers to a broader moral quality or condition that is contrary to God's nature and righteousness. It can encompass various forms of immorality, sin, and harm. The Hebrew word "ra" (רַע) and the Greek word "kakos" (κακός) are often translated as 'evil' and capture a sense of general wrongdoing, harm, or malevolence. For example, in Genesis 6:5, the wickedness of humanity is described as "great" and "every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."

2. **Wickedness**: The term 'wickedness' (from the Hebrew "rasha" [רָשָׁע] and the Greek "poneria" [πονηρία]) often implies a more deliberate, active engagement in wrongdoing, characterized by a moral choice to do harm or injustice. It suggests not just the presence of evil, but an inclination or intent to perpetrate wrongdoing. For instance, Proverbs 4:14-15 warns against entering the path of the wicked and describes wicked behavior as actively seeking out evil.

In summary, while both 'evil' and 'wickedness' indicate moral wrongdoing, 'evil' is more about a condition or state contrary to God’s good, whereas 'wickedness' often conveys a deliberate action and intent to do harm or violate moral commandments. The Bible calls believers to reject both, emphasizing the importance of seeking righteousness and living in accordance with God's will.
