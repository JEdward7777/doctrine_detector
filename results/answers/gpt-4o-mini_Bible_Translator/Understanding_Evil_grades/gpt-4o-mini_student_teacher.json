  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the distinction between 'evil' and 'wickedness' in the context of biblical teachings. They effectively differentiate the broader concept of 'evil' from the specific behaviors associated with 'wickedness' and support their points with relevant biblical references. The only improvement could be to directly align their explanation with the reference answer provided by the teacher for more clarity and conciseness."
