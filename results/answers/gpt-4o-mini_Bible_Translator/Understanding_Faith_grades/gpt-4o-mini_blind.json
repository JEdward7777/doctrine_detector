  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of what it means to have faith in Jesus according to Christian beliefs. The student accurately describes the aspects of trust, belief, acceptance of sacrifice, personal relationship, reliance on grace, belief in resurrection, and commitment to following Jesus. The emphasis on faith as transformative and not merely intellectual assent is commendable. The response could be strengthened by including references to specific biblical passages that support these concepts."
