  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of 'faithless' within a Christian theological context. It accurately explains the lack of belief or trust in God and its implications for moral conduct. The inclusion of biblical references adds depth and authenticity to the explanation. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the connection between faith and moral behavior in Christian ethics."
