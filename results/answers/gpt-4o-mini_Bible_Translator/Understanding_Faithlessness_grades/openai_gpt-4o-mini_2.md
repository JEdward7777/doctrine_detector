The term 'faithless' implies a lack of faith or trust in God. In a Christian theological context, it often refers to someone who does not believe in God, is untrustworthy in their relationship with Him, or has turned away from their faith. This term can also suggest a failure to uphold one's commitments to God, reflecting a spiritual condition characterized by doubt, disbelief, or disloyalty. In biblical passages, being faithless can lead to consequences, as it indicates a separation from the faithfulness and trustworthiness that God extends to humanity. Overall, 'faithless' denotes a significant absence of belief and commitment to God's promises and character.
