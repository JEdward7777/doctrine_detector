  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that delves into various aspects of how a fool is defined in relation to belief and obedience to God in the Bible. They referenced specific verses and highlighted key characteristics associated with foolishness. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the direct contrast between the fool and the wise person mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
