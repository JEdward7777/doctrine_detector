## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites' perception of Gentiles significantly shaped their relationships with them, especially during the early church period. In the Old Testament, Gentiles (non-Jews) were often viewed with suspicion or as outsiders. This was rooted in a strong sense of identity and covenant belonging among the Israelites, who believed they were chosen by God as His special people. Laws and customs set them apart, and many Israelites held strict views regarding purity, worship, and social interaction with Gentiles.

When it came to the early church, which emerged after the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the descent of the Holy Spirit, these perceptions began to shift. The early apostles and disciples initially saw the message of Jesus as one primarily for the Jews. This is evident in the book of Acts, where the apostles focus on Jewish audiences in their early preaching. However, significant events, such as Peter's vision of the clean and unclean animals (Acts 10), led to a transformative understanding that the Gospel was meant for all people.

The Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15) further shaped the relationship between Jewish believers and Gentiles. This council addressed concerns about whether Gentile converts to Christianity needed to adhere to Jewish laws, including circumcision. The decision that Gentiles did not need to follow the entire Mosaic Law, but rather were called to abstain from certain practices, was a pivotal moment in redefining the relationship between Jewish believers and Gentile converts.

Overall, the early church gradually moved from a view of segregation and separation to one of inclusivity and unity under Christ. The Apostle Paul was particularly instrumental in this shift, emphasizing the idea that in Christ there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile (Galatians 3:28). As the early church grew, these relationships were characterized by both challenges and profound transformations, leading to a more inclusive understanding of the body of Christ. This theological shift laid the groundwork for the global nature of the Christian faith as it continued to spread beyond its Jewish roots.
