  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-developed response that demonstrates a strong understanding of how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles impacted their relationships in the early church. The answer effectively discusses the historical context and key events, such as Peter's vision and the Council of Jerusalem, that influenced the shift towards inclusivity. The student's analysis aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of unity under Christ and the transformative nature of the Gospel message. The only improvement would be to directly address the concern by explicitly stating how these perceptions affected the church's unity, although the overall content and perspective are sound."
