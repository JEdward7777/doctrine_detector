  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the title \"Most High\" in relation to God's authority and sovereignty. They have effectively covered key aspects such as sovereignty, transcendence, protection, security, worship, and reverence. The Biblical references support their points well. However, the response could have been more concise and focused directly on the teacher's reference answer to align more closely with the given concern."
