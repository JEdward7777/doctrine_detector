## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Authority.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "Most High" (Hebrew: Elyon; Greek: Hypsistos) signifies God's supreme authority and sovereignty over all creation. In biblical texts, it emphasizes that God is exalted above all other beings and powers, both earthly and heavenly. 

1. **Sovereignty**: The title conveys that God has ultimate control and governance over everything. Psalm 47:2 proclaims, "For the Lord Most High is awesome, the great King over all the earth." This verse illustrates that God's authority surpasses all human authorities and spiritual powers.

2. **Transcendence**: Referring to God as the Most High underscores His transcendence. He exists above and beyond the limitations of time, space, and human understanding. Isaiah 57:15 states, "For this is what the high and exalted One says—he who lives forever, whose name is holy: ‘I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit.’"

3. **Protection and Security**: The title also carries connotations of refuge and safety. Psalms 91:1 begins, "Whoever dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty." Here, the Most High is presented as a source of security and peace for those who seek Him.

4. **Worship and Reverence**: Acknowledging God as the Most High calls for reverent worship and submission to His will. It reminds believers of their position before God and the need to honor Him as the ultimate authority in their lives.

Overall, the title "Most High" reminds us that God holds the highest authority, encouraging us to live in obedience to His sovereign will, trusting in His protection, and worshiping Him with reverence and awe.
