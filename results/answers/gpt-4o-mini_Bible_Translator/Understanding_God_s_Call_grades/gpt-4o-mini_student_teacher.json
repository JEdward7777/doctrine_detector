  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that aligns closely with the reference answer from a Christian perspective. They effectively touched on the personal relationship, divine purpose, assurance, redemption, and the call to respond to God. The student's understanding of the concept \"God has called us by name\" based on Isaiah 43:1 demonstrates a solid grasp of the biblical and theological implications. The only room for improvement would be to further emphasize the aspect of God's personal choice and appointment of individuals for His purpose, as highlighted in the reference answer."
