  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the concept of being 'called' by God from a Christian perspective, addressing various dimensions and implications of this calling. It effectively connects the idea of personal purpose to faith by emphasizing the relational aspect of Christian faith and the assurance and purpose that come from knowing one is called by God. The response is well-supported with relevant biblical references and offers a holistic view of how God's calling manifests in different aspects of a believer's life."
