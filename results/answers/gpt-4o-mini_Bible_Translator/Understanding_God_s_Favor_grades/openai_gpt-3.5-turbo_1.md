## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Favor.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, particularly in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus' favor with God and men is highlighted in a few key passages.

1. **Childhood of Jesus**: In Luke 2:52, it states, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man." This verse suggests that as Jesus grew up, he developed not only intellectually and physically but also in his relationships with both God and people. His obedience to God and his compassion and interactions with others contributed to this favor.

2. **Baptism and Transfiguration**: At both Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:16-17) and the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:5), God the Father publicly affirms Jesus. At the baptism, the Holy Spirit descends upon Jesus like a dove, and a voice from heaven says, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." Such divine endorsement signifies Jesus’ standing with God.

3. **Teachings and Miracles**: Throughout the Gospels, Jesus demonstrated favor with men through His teachings and miracles. He performed acts of compassion, healed the sick, and preached messages that brought hope and liberation (e.g., Luke 4:18-19). These actions made Him well-regarded among many people, although He also faced opposition from religious leaders.

4. **Relationship with the Father**: Jesus often withdrew to pray, showing His dependence on and relationship with God (Luke 5:16). His prayer life reflects a deep intimacy with the Father, which is fundamental to His favor with God.

5. **Fulfillment of God’s Will**: Jesus emphasized doing the will of the Father throughout His ministry (John 4:34; Matthew 26:39), which is a manifestation of His obedience and alignment with God’s purpose, further demonstrating His favor with God.

In summary, Jesus demonstrated favor with God through His obedience, prayer life, and fulfillment of divine purpose, while His compassion, teachings, and miracles contributed to His favor with men.
