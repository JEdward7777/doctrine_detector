  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of seeking God's will in everyday decisions from a Christian perspective. They have clearly outlined key aspects such as prayer, Scripture, the role of the Holy Spirit, community, circumstances, values, and trust. The theological aspects are sound and align well with Christian teachings. The only minor point for improvement could be slightly emphasizing the importance of submission to God's will even when it may go against our personal desires or understanding. Overall, a solid and doctrinally correct response."
