  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured response that aligns closely with the Christian worldview of seeking God's will in everyday decisions. They emphasized essential aspects like prayer, Scripture, the Holy Spirit, community, circumstances, values, and trust in God. While their answer was thorough and insightful, the teacher's reference answer focused more on the core essence of seeking God's will as understanding His desires and aligning choices with His Word. The student's response could have been more concise and focused directly on the central theme of aligning decisions with God's revealed will in Scripture to receive a higher grade."
