## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible presents God's wrath as a profound aspect of His nature, characterized by both justice and holiness. Unlike human anger, which can be impulsive, often irrational, and influenced by personal offense, God's wrath is always righteous, measured, and in alignment with His perfect justice and holiness.

1. **Righteousness and Justice**: God's wrath is a response to sin and injustice. It reflects His holiness and desire for righteousness. For example, in Romans 1:18, it is stated, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men." This indicates that God's wrath is directed toward sin rather than personal grievances.

2. **Purpose of Divine Wrath**: God's wrath serves a redemptive purpose. It is not simply punitive but aims to correct and bring about repentance. In 2 Peter 3:9, we see that God is patient, "not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance." This reflects a desire for restoration rather than mere retribution.

3. **Controlled and Righteous**: While human anger can often be uncontrollable and stem from selfish motives, God's anger is perfectly controlled and seeks to uphold divine order. James 1:20 asserts, "for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God," highlighting the difference between human and divine anger.

4. **Expression of Love**: Interestingly, God's wrath is also an expression of His love for what is good. Like a loving parent who disciplines a child, God's wrath is motivated by His desire for holiness and justice. Hebrews 12:6 says, "For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives."

5. **Eschatological Context**: The Bible often portrays God's wrath in an eschatological context, associated with end times when ultimate justice will be meted out. Revelation 20:11-15 speaks of the final judgment, where God's wrath is executed against sin and rebellion.

In summary, while human anger is often flawed and self-centered, God's wrath is a just and purposeful response to sin that aligns with His character and ultimately seeks to restore rather than simply punish. Understanding this distinction helps to appreciate the holistic nature of God's dealings with humanity, combining justice, mercy, and love.
