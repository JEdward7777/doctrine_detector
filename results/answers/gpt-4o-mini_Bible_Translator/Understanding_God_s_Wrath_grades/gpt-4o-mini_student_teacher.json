  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-reasoned explanation of the nature of God's wrath as portrayed in the Bible, highlighting key differences from human anger. The response effectively illustrates how God's wrath is rooted in righteousness, justice, and love, and emphasizes its redemptive purpose rather than mere punishment. The theological insights and scriptural references demonstrate a strong understanding of the Christian worldview concerning God's wrath. However, there could be a slightly stronger emphasis on the distinction between God's measured response to sin compared to human impulsivity, aligning more closely with the provided concern. Overall, a well-written and insightful answer deserving of a high grade."
