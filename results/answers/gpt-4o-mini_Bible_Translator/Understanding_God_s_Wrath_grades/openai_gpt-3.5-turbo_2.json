  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful elaboration on the nature of God's wrath, aligning well with a Christian worldview. It emphasizes the importance of God's wrath being a measured response to sin, rather than a fit of rage, which addresses the specified concern effectively. The inclusion of scriptural references further strengthens the analysis and demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological underpinnings of God's wrath. Overall, a well-crafted and insightful response."
