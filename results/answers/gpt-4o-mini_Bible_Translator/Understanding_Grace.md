## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In a Christian context, the term "grace" signifies the unmerited favor and kindness of God towards humanity. It is often understood as a pivotal concept in Christian theology, representing God's love and mercy in action, particularly in relation to salvation.

Grace is seen as a gift from God that cannot be earned or deserved through human effort or good works. Instead, it is given freely to believers through faith in Jesus Christ. This concept is beautifully articulated in passages like Ephesians 2:8-9, which states, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast."

Moreover, grace is not only associated with salvation but also with the ongoing work of sanctification. It empowers believers to live righteously and to grow in their relationship with God. The grace of God sustains Christians in their daily lives and helps them to reflect Christ-like qualities.

In summary, grace in Christianity signifies Godâ€™s unconditional love, mercy, and favor, which allows for salvation and spiritual growth, emphasizing that it is purely a divine gift rather than a result of human merit.
