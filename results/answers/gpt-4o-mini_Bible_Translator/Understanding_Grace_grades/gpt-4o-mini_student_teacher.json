  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the concept of grace in Christian theology, emphasizing its significance in salvation and sanctification. The answer aligns closely with the reference answer by highlighting grace as unmerited favor bestowed by God upon humanity. The student effectively incorporates relevant Bible verses to support their explanation. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly stating that grace is God's help or blessing to sinful individuals, emphasizing the unearned nature of this divine gift."
