It effectively clarifies the concept of God's unmerited favor by discussing its implications for salvation and sanctification. The biblical references and the mention of grace empowering believers in their faith journey further strengthen the explanation. Overall, this response aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern."
