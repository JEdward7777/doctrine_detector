## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the concept of being guilty generally refers to an acknowledgment of wrongdoing or sin in relation to God's laws. It encompasses both moral and spiritual dimensions.

1. **Moral Accountability**: Being guilty means that an individual has violated God's commandments or moral laws. For instance, in Exodus 20, the Ten Commandments outline behaviors that are deemed sinful, and violating these instructions can lead to guilt (e.g., theft, adultery, false witness).

2. **Spiritual Condition**: Guilt in a biblical sense is not just about the act itself but also involves the state of one’s heart and relationship with God. In Psalm 32:5, David speaks of confessing his sin and acknowledges that God forgives guilt, suggesting that guilt is a barrier to spiritual health and relationship with God.

3. **Consequences of Guilt**: The Bible often describes consequences for guilt, which can include physical punishment, social repercussions, or spiritual estrangement from God. For example, Romans 6:23 states, "For the wages of sin is death," indicating that guilt leads to death — both physical and spiritual.

4. **The Role of Jesus**: In the New Testament, the concept of guilt is tied to redemption through Jesus Christ. He offers forgiveness and atonement for sin (guilt) through His death and resurrection (1 John 1:9). Believing in Him provides believers with grace, relief from guilt, and restoration of their relationship with God.

5. **Personal Reflection and Repentance**: The Bible encourages self-examination and repentance as responses to guilt. For instance, in John 8, when Jesus encounters the woman caught in adultery, He does not condemn her but calls her to turn from her sin, highlighting the path to restoration.

In summary, being guilty according to the Bible encompasses the acknowledgment of sin, the resulting separation from God, the consequences of that sin, and the offered redemption through faith in Jesus Christ.
