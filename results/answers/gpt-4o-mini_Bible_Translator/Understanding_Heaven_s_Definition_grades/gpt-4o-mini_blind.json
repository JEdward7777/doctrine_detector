  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-structured explanation of the biblical definition of \"heaven\" and distinguishes it from the concept of \"sky\" effectively. The student accurately depicts heaven as both the dwelling place of God and the eternal home of the righteous, supported by relevant biblical references. The clarification on the cosmic expanse aspect is also commendable. However, the response could be enhanced by incorporating more Scriptural references to strengthen the theological points presented. Overall, a solid answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
