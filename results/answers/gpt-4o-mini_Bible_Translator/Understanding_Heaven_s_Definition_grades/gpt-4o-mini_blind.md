In the Bible, the term "heaven" is used in several contexts, and its definition can encompass different meanings depending on the passage. Generally, "heaven" refers to:

1. **The Dwelling Place of God**: In many passages, heaven is depicted as the spiritual realm where God resides and from which He reigns. For example, Psalm 115:16 states, "The heavens are the Lord's heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of man."

2. **The Eternal Home of the Righteous**: Heaven is also described as the final destination for believers after death, characterized by eternal life in the presence of God. Revelation 21:1-4 provides a vision of a new heaven and a new earth, where God will dwell with His people.

3. **The Cosmic Expanse**: The term can also refer to the physical universe or the "sky" as we understand it from a terrestrial viewpoint. In Genesis 1:1, for example, the "heavens" are mentioned in the context of creation: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."

The distinction between "heaven" and "sky" can be summarized as follows:

- **Heaven** (in a theological sense) often refers to a spiritual realm associated with God's presence, eternal life, and the afterlife for believers.
- **Sky** is typically understood as the atmospheric expanse above the Earth, where clouds, stars, and celestial bodies exist. It is the physical realm we see when we look upward during our earthly lives.

In summary, while "sky" refers primarily to the physical, observable atmosphere and celestial bodies, "heaven" encompasses a broader theological significance relating to God's realm, glory, and the eternal destiny of believers.
