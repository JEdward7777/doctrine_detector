  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the biblical definition of \"heaven\" and its distinctions from the term \"sky.\" They effectively addressed different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture and how they impact our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him. However, the student's answer could have been improved by incorporating more direct references to specific Bible verses that illustrate the distinctions between \"heaven\" and \"sky.\" Additionally, while the student delved into the theological significance of \"heaven,\" a stronger emphasis on the biblical view of \"sky\" as the physical expanse above the earth would have enhanced the response. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding but could have provided more in-depth biblical support for their points."
