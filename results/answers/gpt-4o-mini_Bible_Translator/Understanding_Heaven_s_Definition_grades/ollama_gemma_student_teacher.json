It also correctly notes that \"heaven\" encompasses a broader spiritual realm, while \"sky\" refers to the physical atmosphere. \n\nThe student's articulation of the distinction between the two terms is precise and supported by relevant biblical references. The overall clarity and logical organization of the response contribute to a high grade."
