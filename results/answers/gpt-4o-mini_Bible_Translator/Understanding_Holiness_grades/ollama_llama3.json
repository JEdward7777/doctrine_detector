  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the concept of God's absolute holiness, its implications for our relationship with Him, and the transformative power it has in our lives. The writer provides clear biblical examples to support their points, making the response well-researched and informative. The structure is logical, and the transitions between ideas are smooth.\n\nThe concern about reflection on our own holiness and necessary steps for approaching a holy God is also addressed throughout the response. The author acknowledges the awareness of sin that comes from recognizing God's absolute holiness and emphasizes the importance of atonement and transformation through Jesus Christ.\n\nOne area where the response could improve is in providing more nuance and depth to its analysis. While the writer does an excellent job summarizing the main points, some readers may find certain sections a bit too straightforward or lacking in complexity. Additionally, there are no direct quotes from biblical texts, which might make the response less engaging for some readers.\n\nOverall, however, this is an outstanding response that effectively addresses the question and concern."
