In the Bible, the terms iniquity, sin, and transgression have distinct meanings, though they are often used interchangeably in casual conversation. Here’s a brief overview of each term:

1. **Sin**: The broadest term among the three, "sin" refers to any action, thought, or attitude that goes against God's commands and moral laws. It encompasses all forms of wrongdoing and reflects a state of separation from God. In the New Testament, sin is often understood in terms of missing the mark (as in the Greek word "hamartia"). For example, Romans 3:23 states, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

2. **Transgression**: This term typically refers to a specific act of violating a known commandment or law. It implies a willful disobedience or rebellion against God's authority. The Hebrew word often translated as "transgression" can denote a crossing of boundaries or an overstepping of laws. For instance, 1 John 3:4 says, "Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness," highlighting the aspect of violating God’s law.

3. **Iniquity**: This term often conveys a deeper sense of moral evil or wickedness. It can refer to the habitual or persistent nature of sin, often with an emphasis on the consequences that arise from injustices or profound immorality. Iniquity may suggest a morally corrupt state or condition, which is evident in verses like Psalm 51:2, where David says, "Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin." 

In summary, while all three terms refer to wrongdoing, they emphasize different aspects: sin is the overarching term for any moral failure, transgression highlights the act of breaking law, and iniquity tends to stress the moral depravity or the resulting consequences of sin. Understanding these distinctions can enrich one's grasp of biblical teachings on morality and human behavior in relation to God.
