## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In biblical teachings, the term 'innocent' signifies a state of being free from guilt or wrongdoing. It is often associated with someone who has not committed the offense for which they are being accused. This concept is important in various narratives throughout Scripture.

For example, in the book of Job, Job maintains his innocence while suffering and being wrongfully accused by his friends. His declarations of innocence emphasize his faithfulness and righteousness before God, which underscores the theme of unjust suffering.

Additionally, in the New Testament, Jesus was referred to as 'innocent' in the context of His trial and crucifixion, where He was falsely accused and ultimately condemned despite being completely without sin (Matthew 27:4). His innocence serves to highlight His role as the sinless sacrifice for humanity.

The Hebrew and Greek words translated as 'innocent' also reflect a broader theological understanding of justice and righteousness. For instance, in Psalm 26:6-7, the psalmist appeals to God based on his integrity and requests deliverance from enemies, affirming his innocence in the face of lies.

In summary, being 'innocent' in the biblical sense, especially in the context of wrongful accusation, embodies purity, integrity, and an appeal to divine justice, ultimately reinforcing Godâ€™s commitment to righteousness and truth.
