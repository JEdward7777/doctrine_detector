  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession as supported by key biblical passages. The integration of Scripture references and explanations demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explore further how the Holy Spirit empowers believers in prayer beyond just intercession, but overall, this is an excellent response."
