  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-supported answer with key scriptural references that deepen the understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in intercession. However, while their response is thorough, it is important to remember the simplicity and core message of the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's discussion could have been more concise and focused on the central teaching that the Holy Spirit intercedes for believers in prayer."
