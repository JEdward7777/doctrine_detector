  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical principles behind acting justly according to God's laws. They have articulated various aspects of justice, including God's character, obedience to commandments, fairness and equity, integrity in relationships, advocacy for the vulnerable, restorative justice, and repentance and humility. However, the student's response may have delved too deeply into the nuanced aspects of justice, potentially overcomplicating the concept for some readers. Despite this, the student effectively integrated relevant Bible verses to support their points and conveyed a strong grasp of the topic."
