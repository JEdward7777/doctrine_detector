  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the significance of the term \"Lord\" in both biblical and theological contexts. It provides clear explanations of its usage in reference to both God the Father and Jesus Christ, highlighting their authority and divinity. The inclusion of relevant scripture references adds credibility to the response. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the theological implications of the dual application of the term \"Lord\" in relation to the Trinity."
