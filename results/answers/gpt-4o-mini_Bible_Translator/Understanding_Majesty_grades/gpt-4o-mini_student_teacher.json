  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80. \n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive explanation of what the term 'majesty' signifies in relation to God's character, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments to support their points. They have effectively connected 'majesty' to God's greatness, authority, transcendence, and sovereignty over creation. \n\nHowever, the student's response could have been improved by focusing more explicitly on the specific concern of understanding God's attributes and His sovereignty over creation. While they did touch upon God's reign and strength, they could have delved deeper into how God's majesty exemplifies His sovereign rule over all things. \n\nOverall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of 'majesty' in relation to God's character, but could strengthen their argument by emphasizing the aspect of God's sovereignty more clearly."
