It effectively connects the concept of majesty to God's attributes and His reign, supported by relevant biblical references from both the Old and New Testament. The inclusion of the New Testament perspective on Jesus Christ as the embodiment of God's glory and majesty further enriches the response. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview."
