# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the phrase "born again" primarily originates from the conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus in the Gospel of John, specifically John 3:3-7. Jesus tells Nicodemus, "Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again," and further explains that this new birth is a spiritual rebirth, not a physical one. 

To be "born again" means to undergo a transformation through the Holy Spirit, resulting in a new spiritual life. It is associated with repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. This concept is linked to the idea of regeneration, which is the work of the Holy Spirit that brings a person from spiritual death to spiritual life. 

In theological terms, being born again reflects a fundamental change in a person's relationship with God; it signifies a turning away from sin and a commitment to follow Christ. This transformation leads to a new identity as a child of God and entails living according to His will, marked by ongoing spiritual growth and a desire to live in accordance with biblical teachings.

In summary, according to the Bible, being "born again" signifies a profound spiritual renewal through the work of the Holy Spirit, enabling individuals to enter into a personal relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ.
