In the New Testament, to "perish" in a spiritual sense often refers to a state of separation from God and the consequences of sin. This concept is rooted in the understanding of eternal life versus eternal separation from God's presence.

1. **Separation from God**: The term suggests a condition where an individual is alienated from God due to sin. For instance, in John 3:16, it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Here, 'perish' implies the opposite of eternal life, indicating spiritual death or separation from the divine.

2. **Judgment and Destruction**: Perishing can also refer to the divine judgment that leads to destruction. In Matthew 10:28, Jesus admonishes not to fear those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul, but rather to fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. This denotes a more severe consequence, emphasizing both spiritual death and eternal punishment.

3. **Loss of Purpose and Fulfillment**: To perish spiritually is also to lose the intended purpose and fulfillment that comes from a relationship with God. In this sense, 'perishing' encompasses a life devoid of spiritual vitality, joy, and hope that comes from abiding in Christ.

4. **The Importance of Faith**: The New Testament consistently associates faith in Jesus Christ as a means to avoid spiritual perishing. Believers are promised salvation and eternal life, illustrating that faith acts as a safeguard against spiritual death.

In summary, to spiritually "perish" in the New Testament context typically signifies a profound and eternal separation from God, resulting from sin and a lack of faith, contrasted with the promise of eternal life through belief in Jesus Christ.
