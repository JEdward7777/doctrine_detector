  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The answer provides a solid explanation of the concept of \"perishing\" in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. The student effectively references relevant Bible verses and articulates key points regarding separation from God, judgment and destruction, loss of purpose, and the importance of faith. It could be strengthened by further emphasizing the eternal nature of the separation from God and the severity of the consequences, as well as by connecting the concept of perishing more directly to foundational Christian doctrines such as sin and atonement. Overall, a well-informed response."
