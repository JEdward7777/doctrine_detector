  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of what it means to 'perish' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament, exploring various aspects such as separation from God, judgment, loss of purpose, and the importance of faith. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the central aspect of refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, incorporating more direct scriptural references would strengthen the biblical foundation of the explanation."
