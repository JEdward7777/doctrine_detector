The student effectively connects the theological and ritual aspects of purification with key doctrinal concepts such as holiness, sin, atonement, and community cohesion. Additionally, the mention of the foreshadowing of Christ in the Old Testament purification rituals demonstrates a solid understanding of how these practices point towards the ultimate purification through Jesus Christ in Christian theology. Overall, this answer is doctrinally sound and well-supported. Great job!"
