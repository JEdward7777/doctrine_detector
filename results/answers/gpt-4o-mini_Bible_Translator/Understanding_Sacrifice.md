## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Jesus is referred to as the "Lamb of God" primarily for its theological significance in relation to the sacrificial system established in the Old Testament. This designation highlights several key points in Christian theology:

1. **Sacrificial System**: In the Old Testament, lambs were commonly used as sacrifices for sin. For instance, during Passover, a spotless lamb was slain, and its blood was applied to the doorposts of the Israelites' homes to protect them from the final plague in Egypt (Exodus 12:1-13). This act of sacrifice and the significance of the lamb's blood are central to the concept of atonement.

2. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**: In the Gospel of John, when John the Baptist sees Jesus coming, he declares, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29). This proclamation identifies Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament sacrifices, signifying that He would provide ultimate atonement for humanity's sins.

3. **Spotless and Sinless**: The criteria for a sacrificial lamb in the Old Testament was that it had to be without blemish (Exodus 12:5). Jesus, being sinless and perfect, fits this requirement as the ultimate sacrifice, making Him capable of bearing the sins of the world (1 Peter 1:18-19).

4. **Atonement and Redemption**: Jesus' death on the cross is understood by Christians as the ultimate sacrifice that atones for sin. His shed blood provides a means of reconciliation between God and humanity, fulfilling the purpose of the sacrificial system of the Old Testament (Hebrews 9:12-14, Romans 5:9).

5. **Theological Symbolism**: The lamb has become a profound symbol of innocence and sacrifice, and readers of the New Testament see Jesusâ€™ sacrifice as not merely a historical event but a divine plan for salvation. The Book of Revelation refers to Jesus as the "Lamb" repeatedly, underscoring His role in salvation history and His reign as King (Revelation 5:6-14).

In summary, referring to Jesus as the "Lamb of God" connects His life and sacrificial death to the historical and theological context of the sacrificial lambs in the Old Testament, portraying Him as the fulfillment of the law and the ultimate means of redemption for humankind.
