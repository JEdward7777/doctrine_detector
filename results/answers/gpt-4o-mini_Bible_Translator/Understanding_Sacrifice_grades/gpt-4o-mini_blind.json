  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a well-articulated and comprehensive explanation of why Jesus is referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. The answer effectively covers the theological significance, fulfillment of prophecy, sinlessness of Jesus, atonement, and the symbolism associated with this designation. One point for improvement could be to explicitly mention the connection between Jesus as the Lamb of God and the concept of substitutionary atonement, emphasizing how His sacrifice bears the sins of humanity."
