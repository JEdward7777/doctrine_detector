  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of why Jesus is referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. The response demonstrates a sound understanding of the theological significance behind this designation, drawing upon biblical references and key points in Christian theology. The student effectively connects the Old Testament sacrificial system with Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption. This response is well-reasoned, thorough, and aligns closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher. Great job!"
