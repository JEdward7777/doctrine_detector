# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of the Christian faith, the name "Satan" originates from the Hebrew word "שָּׂטָן" (satan), which means "adversary" or "accuser." In the biblical narrative, Satan is often depicted as a being who opposes God and seeks to lead humanity away from righteousness.

Satan is commonly associated with temptation, deception, and opposition to God’s purposes. In the New Testament, he is depicted as the ultimate source of evil, temptation, and spiritual conflict. For example, in the Gospels, Satan tempts Jesus in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11) and is referred to as the "father of lies" (John 8:44).

The role of Satan within Christian theology encompasses various functions, such as that of a tempter (tempting individuals to sin), an accuser (bringing charges against humanity before God), and a ruler of the powers of darkness (Ephesians 6:12). Ultimately, Christian belief holds that Satan's power is limited and that he is ultimately defeated through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, affirming the triumph of good over evil.
