The Hebrew term 'Shaddai' (שַׁדָּי) is often translated as "Almighty" in English versions of the Bible, particularly in the context of referring to God. The word itself is thought to derive from the root "shad," which can mean "breast" and potentially signifies a nourishing, sustaining aspect of God. Thus, it carries connotations of power, sufficiency, and the ability to provide.

In the Old Testament, 'Shaddai' is primarily used to describe the omnipotent nature of God, emphasizing His capability to fulfill His promises and protect His people. This term appears in key passages, notably in the Abrahamic covenant where God reveals Himself as El Shaddai (God Almighty) to Abraham in Genesis 17:1, reaffirming His promise to make him a father of many nations.

Throughout the Old Testament, 'Shaddai' emphasizes God’s ultimate power over creation and His role as a protector and provider. For example, in Job, God is often referred to as Shaddai, underscoring His authority and sovereignty over human suffering and circumstances. 

Additionally, the term is used in various forms across different contexts, essentially reminding the faithful of God's might and willingness to intervene on behalf of those who trust in Him. Overall, the usage of 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament encapsulates a rich depiction of God's character as powerful, nurturing, and faithful.
