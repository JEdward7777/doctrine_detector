They correctly highlighted the importance of Scripture, faithfulness to His mission, prayer, recognizing the nature of temptation, reliance on the Holy Spirit, and preparation through fasting. While the student's answer delves deeper into each strategy and its significance for Christians facing temptation in daily life, the reference answer simplifies it to the essentials. Thus, the student's answer provides a more comprehensive understanding and application of the strategies Jesus employed."
