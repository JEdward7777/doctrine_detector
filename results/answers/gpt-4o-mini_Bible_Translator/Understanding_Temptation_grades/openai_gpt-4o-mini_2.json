The integration of specific examples from the Gospels, such as Jesus' use of Scripture, faithfulness to His mission, prayer, understanding the nature of temptation, reliance on the Holy Spirit, and preparation through fasting, effectively addresses the concern of combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. The inclusion of these key strategies and their application to Christians facing temptation enhances the depth and relevance of the answer."
