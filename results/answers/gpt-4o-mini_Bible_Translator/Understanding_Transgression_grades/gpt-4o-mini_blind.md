## [Answer](../Understanding_Transgression.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In a Biblical context, the term "transgress" refers to the act of violating or going beyond a boundary set by God, particularly in relation to His commandments, moral laws, or covenantal obligations. It implies a willful disobedience or rebellion against God's will. 

The Hebrew word often translated as "transgress" is *pāša‘*, which conveys the idea of breaking trust or acting treacherously. In the New Testament, the Greek word *parabasis* can also be used, which denotes a breach of law or an infringement upon established standards.

Theologically, transgression signifies a serious offense that alienates an individual from God and can lead to spiritual consequences. It emphasizes the importance of holiness and obedience in the life of a believer and highlights the need for repentance and reconciliation with God through grace, as seen in the teachings about sin and redemption throughout Scripture.
