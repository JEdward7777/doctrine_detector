  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the term \"transgress\" in a Biblical context, incorporating both Hebrew and Greek perspectives. They effectively connect transgression to disobedience against God's will and the theological implications of such actions. The answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, showing a strong understanding of the nature of sin and our relationship with God's commandments from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
