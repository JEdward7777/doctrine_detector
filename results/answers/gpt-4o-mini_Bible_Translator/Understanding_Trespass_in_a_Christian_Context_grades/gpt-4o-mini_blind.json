The student effectively discusses the definitions of sin and trespass, their biblical context, consequences, and the restorative perspective within Christianity. The answer could be further improved by connecting the concept of trespass to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, emphasizing Christ's role as the ultimate sacrifice for our trespasses and sins."
