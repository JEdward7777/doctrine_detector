  "grade": 92.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 92.\n\nThis response effectively expands on the definition of an unholy life, providing specific characteristics and examples from Scripture to support its claims. It also offers practical advice for identifying and overcoming unholy behaviors, including self-reflection, community feedback, and awareness of cultural trends. The tone is informative, yet still acknowledges the importance of personal and communal responsibility in seeking a holy life.\n\nThe only areas where improvement could be made are:\n\n* Some of the sentences could be rephrased or reorganized for greater clarity and concision.\n* While the response provides several examples from Scripture, it would be even stronger if more verses were used to illustrate each point.\n\nOverall, however, this is a well-structured and informative response that effectively addresses the concern about self-examination and awareness of unholiness in personal and communal behavior."
