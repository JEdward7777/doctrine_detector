## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "woe" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments signifies a state of deep distress or lamentation. It is often used to convey God's displeasure or impending judgment against sin, disobedience, or injustice. In the Scriptures, "woe" serves as a solemn warning, highlighting the seriousness of the situation and the consequences that follow unfaithfulness or rebellion against God's commandments.

For example, in the prophetic books of the Old Testament, prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah use "woe" to announce judgment upon nations and individuals who have turned away from God. Similarly, in the New Testament, Jesus employs the term to express sorrow and impending judgment for those who refuse to repent, as seen in passages like Matthew 23, where He pronounces "woes" upon the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy.

In essence, "woe" functions as a call to repentance, urging individuals and communities to recognize their sinful state and return to God before it is too late. It encapsulates both the compassion of God, who warns His people, and the righteousness of God, who judges sin.
