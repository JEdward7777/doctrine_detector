It effectively explains the significance of \"woe\" as conveying distress, God's displeasure, and impending judgment. The student effectively references both Old Testament prophets and Jesus in the New Testament to illustrate the use of \"woe\" as a solemn warning calling for repentance. The emphasis on both God's compassion and righteousness in issuing warnings and judgments is well articulated. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound explanation. Great job!"
