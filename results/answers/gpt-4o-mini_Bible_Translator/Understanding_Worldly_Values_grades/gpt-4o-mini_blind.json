  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the term 'worldly' according to Christian teachings. The student effectively references relevant biblical passages to support their points and demonstrates an understanding of the negative connotations associated with worldly behaviors and values in Christianity. The response could be enhanced by including a bit more emphasis on the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in helping believers overcome worldly influences."
