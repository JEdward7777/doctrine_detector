  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained response that effectively contrasts worldly values with godly principles according to Christian teachings. The use of biblical references and explanations adds depth to the answer. However, the student could have emphasized more on the explicitly negative connotations of 'worldly' as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Striking a balance between the negative aspects of worldly behaviors and the biblical warnings against them would have strengthened the response further."
