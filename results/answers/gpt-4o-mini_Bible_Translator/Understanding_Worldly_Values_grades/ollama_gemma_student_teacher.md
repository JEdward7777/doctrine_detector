## [Answer](../Understanding_Worldly_Values.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian teachings, the term 'worldly' typically implies behaviors and values that are aligned with secular or materialistic pursuits, rather than with spiritual or divine principles. The concept often encompasses a lifestyle that prioritizes immediate pleasures, desires, and ambitions of this life, which may include excessive focus on wealth, power, status, or sensuality.

From a biblical perspective, being worldly can be seen as being influenced by the values and priorities of a society that is often in opposition to God's will. For instance, in 1 John 2:15-17, believers are cautioned against loving the world or the things in the world, as such love is seen as incompatible with a love for the Father. Similarly, James 4:4 states that friendship with the world is enmity with God, highlighting a dichotomy between worldly values and a life devoted to God.

In essence, 'worldly' behaviors and values reflect a focus on the temporal and material, often at the expense of spiritual growth and obedience to God's commandments. Christians are encouraged to seek the things of God rather than be conformed to the patterns of this world (Romans 12:2), thereby cultivating a life that reflects God's glory and purpose.
