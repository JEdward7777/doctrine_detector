  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the concept of being \"worldly\" as referring to behaviors and values that are aligned with secular or materialistic pursuits, rather than spiritual or divine principles. It also correctly emphasizes the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, citing relevant biblical passages such as 1 John 2:15-17, James 4:4, and Romans 12:2.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more specific examples of worldly behaviors and values, rather than relying on general terms like \"selfishness\" and \"ungodliness.\" Additionally, while the response does highlight the importance of seeking God's glory and purpose, it could delve deeper into what this looks like in practical terms for Christians.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively explores the concept of being \"worldly\" from a biblical perspective. The grade of 85 reflects its solid grasp of the topic and its ability to apply relevant biblical passages to understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles."
