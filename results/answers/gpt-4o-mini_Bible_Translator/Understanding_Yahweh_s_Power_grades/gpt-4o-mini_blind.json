  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and well-explained analysis of the statement \"I am Yahweh\" in the context of God's character and power, particularly in relation to commands and promises. The response effectively highlights key theological implications such as self-existence, sovereignty, covenantal relationship, moral authority, power to deliver, and revelation of God's nature. The insights are doctrinally sound and offer a solid understanding of the significance of God's declaration in Scripture. Great job!"
