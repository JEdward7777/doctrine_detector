  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel, they have leaned heavily on scholarly and literary analysis, missing the heart of the concern which focuses on the metaphorical language in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people. \n\nThe student effectively delves into the theological and cultural significance of the term, but their answer lacks a clear connection to the implications for God's relationship with His people. The reference answer from the teacher succinctly highlights this relationship aspect, which the student's response does not explicitly emphasize. \n\nThe student could improve their answer by explicitly tying the metaphorical language of \"Daughter of Zion\" to God's affection and care for His people, as mentioned in the reference answer. This would demonstrate a stronger connection to the concern provided."
