  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the Bible, highlighting their distinctions in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. The response is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the student could have further emphasized the shift in understanding of Sheol and Hades over time, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response with room for slight improvement."
