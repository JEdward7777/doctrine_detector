  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a good job of highlighting the distinction between Sheol and Hades, as well as their respective roles in understanding the fate of the righteous and unrighteous after death. The response correctly notes that while both terms refer to a place of the dead, they have distinct connotations and implications in different parts of the Bible.\n\nOne area for improvement is the lack of detailed biblical support for these points. While the response mentions specific passages (Psalm 6:5, Luke 16:19-31), it would be strengthened by additional scriptural references to further illustrate the distinctions between Sheol and Hades. Additionally, some clarification on how these intermediate states relate to the final judgment and eternal outcomes would enhance the overall understanding of this topic.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical concepts surrounding Sheol and Hades, as well as their significance in understanding the afterlife."
