The explanation is clear and supported by biblical references, demonstrating a solid grasp of the Christian worldview on the topic. The only improvement would be to explicitly tie in the understanding of Sheol and Hades to the divine judgment, as this aspect is crucial in considering the ultimate destinies of the righteous and the unrighteous in Christian theology."
