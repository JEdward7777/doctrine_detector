  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the significance of Jesus Christ as the \"cornerstone\" in the context of the Assembly of believers. The response effectively addresses the concerns raised, highlighting Christ's foundational role, unity, spiritual authority, fulfillment of prophecy, building up of believers, and stability during trials. The explanation is well-supported with relevant scriptural references and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The only minor point of improvement would be to link the content more directly to the concern provided."
