  "grade_comment": "I'm happy to help!\n\nBased on the response, I would give it a score of 92.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The response effectively explains the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone in Christian theology, highlighting various scriptural references and theological points.\n* It provides a clear and concise summary of Jesus' role in the Church, emphasizing His foundation, unity, authority, fulfillment of prophecy, and stability during trials.\n* The response also shows a good understanding of the significance of Christ's role in the church, illustrating how it can impact a believer's faith and community involvement.\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is by providing more explicit connections between Jesus' role as the cornerstone and its practical implications for believers. While the text does touch on this topic, it could be further developed to provide more concrete examples or applications.\n\nOverall, I'm impressed with the response's clarity, depth, and relevance to the concern. It effectively demonstrates an understanding of Christ's role in the church and its impact on believers' faith and community involvement."
