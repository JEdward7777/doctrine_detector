  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComments: This is an excellent response that provides a thorough explanation of the term \"house of God\" in the biblical context. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of both the literal and metaphorical meanings of the term, supported by relevant biblical references. The student effectively conveys the significance of the \"house of God\" in highlighting God's desire for relationship with His people. The only potential area for improvement could be to further emphasize the sanctity and reverence associated with the \"house of God\" as seen in passages like Psalm 84:10 (\"Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked\"). Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
