The student does a commendable job of incorporating key biblical references and theological concepts to support their points. The explanation of the rule of God, the present and future aspects of the kingdom, ethical implications, inclusivity, transformational power, spiritual warfare, and the role of believers in the kingdom is thorough and well-supported. The only area for improvement would be to perhaps delve deeper into the Old Testament background of the kingdom concept to provide a more holistic understanding. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound analysis. Great job!"
