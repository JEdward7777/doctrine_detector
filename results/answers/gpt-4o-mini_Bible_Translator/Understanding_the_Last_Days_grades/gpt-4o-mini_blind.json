The student effectively explains the significance of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' ministry, death, resurrection, and the eventual return. The answer demonstrates a good grasp of key biblical passages and themes related to eschatology. The explanation is doctrinally sound and provides a clear, cohesive overview of the topic. Well done!"
