In Christian theology, the term "last days" generally refers to a period associated with the events leading up to the culmination of God's plan for humanity, particularly in relation to Jesus Christ's first coming, His resurrection, and His promised second coming.

1. **Jesus' First Coming**: The "last days" began with the first coming of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, particularly in the book of Acts (2:17), the Apostle Peter quotes the prophet Joel, asserting that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was a fulfillment of prophecy regarding the "last days." This signifies that with Jesus’ ministry, death, and resurrection, a new era in God's redemptive history has begun. The "last days" denote a time of fulfillment where God's promises are being inaugurated through Christ.

2. **Jesus' Second Coming**: The "last days" also encompass the period leading up to Jesus' second coming. In this eschatological context, Christians believe that the "last days" will involve various signs, trials, and the eventual return of Christ to fully establish God's Kingdom. This is reflected in various New Testament texts, such as Matthew 24 and Revelation, which describe the events and signs that will precede the return of Christ.

Theologically, the "last days" can be viewed as a time of ongoing spiritual struggle, the spreading of the Gospel, and the anticipation of the final restoration when Christ will return in glory to judge the living and the dead, ultimately culminating in the realization of God’s eternal Kingdom.

In summary, the "last days" signify both the fulfillment initiated by Jesus’ first coming and the expectation of His second coming, marking a significant transition in God's redemptive plan and the unfolding of history towards its ultimate conclusion.
