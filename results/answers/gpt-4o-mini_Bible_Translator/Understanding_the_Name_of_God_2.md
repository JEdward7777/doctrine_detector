The name "Yahweh" signifies the personal, covenantal name of God in the context of the Old Testament. It is derived from the Hebrew verb "hayah," meaning "to be" or "to exist," and is often interpreted to convey Godâ€™s eternal nature, self-existence, and faithfulness. 

In Exodus 3:14, when God reveals His name to Moses from the burning bush, He states, "I AM WHO I AM," which underscores His unchanging and eternal essence. The use of "Yahweh" indicates a relational aspect, emphasizing God's commitment to His people and His desire to be known in a personal way. 

Throughout the Old Testament, Yahweh is associated with God's active involvement in history, particularly in the covenant relationships with figures like Abraham, Moses, and the nation of Israel. Yahweh embodies attributes such as holiness, mercy, justice, and sovereignty, making Him central to the identity of the Israelites and their worship practices.
