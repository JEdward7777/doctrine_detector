The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation by showing how the temporary deliverance provided by the judges in the Old Testament foreshadowed the eternal salvation brought by Jesus Christ. The response is well-supported with Scripture references and portrays a strong Christian worldview perspective."
