The student clearly articulates how the judges foreshadow the eternal salvation provided by Jesus, highlighting the progression from temporary deliverance to permanent redemption. The inclusion of key theological points such as divine empowerment, covenant fulfillment, and justice further strengthens the argument and showcases a comprehensive understanding of the Christian worldview. Well done!"
