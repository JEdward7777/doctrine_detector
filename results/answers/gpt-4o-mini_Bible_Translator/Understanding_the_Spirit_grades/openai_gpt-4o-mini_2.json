  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and detailed explanation of the distinction between the human spirit and evil spirits according to a Christian worldview. It effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the nature and roles of each, supported by relevant biblical references. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and effectively differentiates between personal spiritual identity and malevolent spiritual influences. Great job!"
