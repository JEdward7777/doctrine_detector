It accurately highlights key theological and biblical aspects tied to this title, including Jesus' humanity, messianic references, the concept of the suffering servant, and eschatological themes. The answer could be improved by delving deeper into the Old Testament background of the term \"Son of Man\" and how it relates to Jesus' claim of divinity. Overall, a very good and well-articulated response."
