  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' from theological and biblical perspectives. They effectively discuss Jesus' humanity, messianic references, the concept of the suffering servant, and the eschatological focus associated with the title. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, as well as His connection to humanity, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
