  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of capturing the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" and its implications for our faith. The writer provides a clear and concise explanation of the title's meaning, highlighting Jesus' dual nature, His role as the Messiah, and His connection to humanity. The inclusion of specific biblical references (Daniel 7:13-14) and eschatological themes further strengthens the response.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement. While the response provides a good overview of the significance of the title \"Son of Man,\" it could delve deeper into the implications of this identification for our faith. For example, how does Jesus' identification as the Son of Man affect our understanding of His mission and purpose? How can we apply the themes and paradoxes associated with this title to our daily lives?\n\nOverall, this response provides a solid foundation for exploring the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the Son of Man, but could benefit from further development and application."
