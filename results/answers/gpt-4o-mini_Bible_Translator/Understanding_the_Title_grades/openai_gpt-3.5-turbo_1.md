# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The title "Son of Man" is significant in the context of Jesus' identity for several reasons, both theological and biblical.

1. **Humanity**: The term emphasizes Jesus' full humanity. By referring to Himself as the Son of Man, Jesus identifies with the human experience and reflects His role as the representative of mankind. This title indicates that Jesus is not only divine but also fully human, which is foundational to Christian theology concerning the Incarnation.

2. **Messianic Reference**: "Son of Man" also has strong messianic connotations, particularly from the book of Daniel in the Old Testament. Daniel 7:13-14 mentions “one like a son of man” coming with the clouds of heaven and being given authority, glory, and sovereign power. This passage is interpreted by many Christians as a prophetic reference pointing to Jesus as the Messiah who will establish God's kingdom.

3. **Suffering Servant**: In the context of Jesus' ministry, the title captures the paradox of His mission. While He is the Messiah and holds authority, He also came to serve and ultimately suffer. In passages such as Mark 10:45, Jesus states that the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many. This underscores the theme of humility and sacrificial love that is central to His identity and mission.

4. **Eschatological Focus**: The title "Son of Man" is often associated with eschatological themes, referring to the end times and the final judgment. Jesus uses the term multiple times when discussing His return and the coming of the kingdom of God, indicating His authority and role in the final redemption and restoration of creation.

In summary, the title "Son of Man" encapsulates Jesus' identity as both divine and human, His role as the Messiah who suffers, and His prophetic office that encompasses authority and eschatological significance. It draws from Hebrew scriptures and deepens the understanding of His mission and relationship to humanity.
