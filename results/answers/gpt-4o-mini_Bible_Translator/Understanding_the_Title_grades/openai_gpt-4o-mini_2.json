  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and thorough explanation of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" within Christian theology. It addresses the theological, biblical, messianic, and eschatological aspects of this title, demonstrating a deep understanding of its implications for faith. The discussion is well-supported with relevant scriptural references and accurately conveys the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine. The response effectively connects the title to Jesus' role as the Messiah and His relationship to humanity, fulfilling the concern raised. Great job in presenting a comprehensive analysis with a Christian worldview perspective."
