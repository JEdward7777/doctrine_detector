  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively communicates key themes and verses regarding the consequences that God pronounces on ungodly people according to the Bible. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the concepts of separation from God, judgment, death and destruction, final judgment, corruption of character, and temporal consequences. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses strengthens the response and supports the doctrinal integrity of the Christian worldview. Great job overall!"
