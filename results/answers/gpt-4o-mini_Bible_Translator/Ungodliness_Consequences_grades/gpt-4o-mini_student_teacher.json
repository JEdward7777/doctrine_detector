  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70. The student provided a thorough explanation supported by relevant Bible verses on the consequences of ungodliness, highlighting key themes such as separation from God, judgment, death and destruction, final judgment, corruption of character, and temporal consequences. However, the student's answer lacked emphasis on the specific reference answer provided by the teacher, which was God pronouncing judgment and wrath on ungodly people who reject Him and His ways. The student's response could have been strengthened by directly addressing this concern and aligning their detailed explanation with the teacher's reference answer."
