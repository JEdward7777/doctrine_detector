The term "Holy One" is used in various contexts throughout both the Old and New Testaments, often referring to God, His attributes, or individuals who are set apart for His purposes.

   - **Isaiah 1:4**: This verse mentions Israel rebelling against "the Holy One of Israel," signifying God’s holy nature contrasted with Israel’s sin.
   - **Psalm 30:4**: The psalmist calls upon the "Holy One," again referring to God and His unique holiness.

2. **Prophetic References**: The Holy One can also refer to God's chosen instruments:
   - **Isaiah 41:14**: God calls Himself the "Holy One of Israel," providing comfort to Israel amidst their fears.

3. **Messianic Foreshadowing**: The term is used in contexts that foreshadow the coming Messiah:
   - **Isaiah 53:11**: Here the "Righteous One" is understood as a reference to the coming Savior, often linked with the concept of holiness.

4. **God's Judgment and Salvation**: The use emphasizes God’s authority in judgment and redemption.
   - **Habakkuk 1:12**: The prophet acknowledges God as "Holy One," ensuring His actions are just.

### New Testament Contexts:

1. **Jesus Christ**: In the New Testament, "Holy One" is often used to describe Jesus, affirming His divine nature:
   - **Luke 1:35**: The angel tells Mary that "the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God."
   - **Acts 3:14**: Peter refers to Jesus as "the Holy One and the Just" when speaking to the crowds about the crucifixion.

2. **Believers' Calling**: The New Testament also uses the term to describe those who are set apart for God:
   - **1 Peter 1:15-16**: Believers are called to be holy as God is holy. The concept ties in with their identity as a royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9).

3. **Divine Worship**: In discussing worship and the divine nature, references to "the Holy One" highlight the reverence owed to God:
   - **Revelation 4:8**: The beings around the throne proclaim, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,” emphasizing God's eternal holiness.

### Summary:
Overall, the term "Holy One" serves to underscore God’s nature and character, the uniqueness of Jesus as the Messiah, and the calling of believers to reflect God's holiness in their lives. It appears in contexts of worship, prophecy, and teaching about holiness, demonstrating continuity in the biblical narrative.
