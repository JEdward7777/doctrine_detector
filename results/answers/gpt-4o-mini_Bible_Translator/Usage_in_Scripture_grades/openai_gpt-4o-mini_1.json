The inclusion of specific Bible verses and explanations demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. However, there is no direct exploration of the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which was the specified concern. This detailed response could have been enhanced by specifically addressing how the term \"Holy One\" in the New Testament emphasizes Jesus' authority and divinity."
