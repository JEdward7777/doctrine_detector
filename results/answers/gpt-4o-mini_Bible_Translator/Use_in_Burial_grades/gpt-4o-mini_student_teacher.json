  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how myrrh was used in burial practices during biblical times, citing relevant Biblical references. They connected myrrh's significance to honoring the dead and following cultural and religious customs effectively. However, there was some additional information included that may have slightly deviated from the focus on burial practices. The response could have been slightly improved by focusing more on the anointing aspect emphasized in the reference answer."
