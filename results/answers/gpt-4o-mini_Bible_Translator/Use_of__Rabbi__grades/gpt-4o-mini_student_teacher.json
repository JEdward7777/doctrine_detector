They accurately distinguished between the roles of John the Baptist as a prophetic figure and Jesus as a teacher. However, they could have provided more direct evidence to support the claim that both John the Baptist and Jesus were sometimes referred to as \"Rabbi\" by their disciples. It would have been beneficial for the student to include specific instances where John the Baptist was called \"Rabbi\" by his disciples in the Gospels to align more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
