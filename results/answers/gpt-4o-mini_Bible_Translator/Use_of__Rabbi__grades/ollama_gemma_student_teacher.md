## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the term "Rabbi" is primarily used to refer to Jesus. The title means "teacher" in Hebrew and signifies someone who is recognized as an authority in Jewish law and theology.

1. **John the Baptist:** While John the Baptist is often seen as a prophetic figure and a forerunner to Jesus, he is not explicitly referred to as "Rabbi" in the Gospels. Instead, he is known for baptizing and proclaiming the coming of the Messiah. His role was more of a prophetic voice calling people to repentance rather than a teacher in the rabbinic sense.

2. **Jesus:** On the other hand, Jesus is addressed as "Rabbi" by His followers and others throughout the Gospels. For instance, in John 1:38, two of John the Baptist's disciples call Jesus "Rabbi" when they begin to follow Him. This title signifies His role as a teacher and His authoritative position in interpreting the Scriptures.

In summary, John the Baptist is not commonly referred to as "Rabbi," while Jesus is recognized with this title, reflecting His role as a teacher and leader within the Jewish context of His ministry.
