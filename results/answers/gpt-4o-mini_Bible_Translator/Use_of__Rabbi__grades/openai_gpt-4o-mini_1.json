  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response accurately explains the significance of the title \"Rabbi\" in the context of Jesus and John the Baptist. It acknowledges Jesus' and John's roles as teachers and the respect and authority associated with their teachings, aligning well with a Christian worldview that values the teachings of Jesus and recognizes Him as the ultimate authority. The only minor improvement could be providing more specific scriptural references to support the explanation further."
