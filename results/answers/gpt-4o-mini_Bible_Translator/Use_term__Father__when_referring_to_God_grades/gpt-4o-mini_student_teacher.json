  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 70. \n\nWhile the student acknowledges the importance of the term \"Father\" in Christian theology and the scriptural basis for using it, they also consider the potential for misunderstandings in certain contexts and suggest using alternative terminology if needed. However, the student's response does not fully align with the Christian worldview reference answer, which emphasizes the necessity of using the term 'Father' and relying on teaching and context to clarify any misunderstandings. \n\nOverall, the student's answer shows some understanding of the topic but lacks strong alignment with the Christian specific worldview concern provided."
