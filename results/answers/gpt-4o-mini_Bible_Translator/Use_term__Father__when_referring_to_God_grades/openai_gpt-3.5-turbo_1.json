It also acknowledges the need for clarity and explanation in multicultural or interfaith settings to avoid misunderstandings. By emphasizing the importance of teaching and context, the response effectively addresses the concern of potential theological inaccuracies and dilution of the scriptural message. Overall, this is a well-rounded and thoughtful reflection from a Christian worldview."
