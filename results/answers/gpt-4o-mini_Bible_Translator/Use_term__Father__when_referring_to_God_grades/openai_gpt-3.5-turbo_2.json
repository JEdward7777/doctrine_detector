It appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the need to rely on teaching and context to clarify any potential misunderstandings. The suggestion of using alternative language in certain contexts shows careful consideration while still affirming the theological accuracy and scriptural message. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful response from a Christian worldview."
