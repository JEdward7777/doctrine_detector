## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
Jesus used several parables to describe the value of the Kingdom of God. Here are a few notable ones:

1. **The Parable of the Treasure in the Field (Matthew 13:44)**: In this parable, Jesus tells of a man who finds a hidden treasure in a field. He sells all that he has to buy the field, illustrating how the Kingdom of Heaven is of such great value that one should be willing to give up everything for it.

2. **The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price (Matthew 13:45-46)**: Similar to the treasure parable, this story describes a merchant seeking fine pearls who finds one of great value. He sells everything he has to purchase it, representing the immense worth of the Kingdom of God.

3. **The Parable of the Mustard Seed (Matthew 13:31-32)**: Jesus compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds but grows into a large tree. This illustrates how the Kingdom starts small but can grow to become something magnificent.

4. **The Parable of the Leaven (Matthew 13:33)**: Here, Jesus compares the Kingdom to leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, which eventually causes the entire batch to rise. This signifies how the Kingdom of God can influence and transform the world quietly but powerfully.

5. **The Parable of the Lost Sheep (Luke 15:1-7)**: This parable emphasizes the value of every individual within the Kingdom of God. Jesus describes a shepherd who leaves the ninety-nine sheep to find the one that is lost, illustrating God's love and care for every person.

6. **The Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37)**: While not directly stating the value of the Kingdom, it demonstrates the Kingdom's principles of love, mercy, and compassion toward others, showing that true neighbors are those who act in love.

These parables collectively emphasize the extraordinary value, transformative power, and inclusive nature of the Kingdom of God, encouraging believers to seek it above all else.
