The explanations given are thorough and demonstrate a good understanding of the significance of these parables in appreciating the worth of the Kingdom of God in our lives. The additional parables mentioned, such as the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Good Samaritan, although not directly answering the question, effectively highlight the Kingdom's principles of love, care, and compassion. Overall, an excellent response that aligns well with the Christian worldview."
