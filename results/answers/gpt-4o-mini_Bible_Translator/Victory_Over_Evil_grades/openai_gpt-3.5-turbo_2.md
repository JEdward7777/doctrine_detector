## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, one of the key promises regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan is found in the book of Revelation. Revelation 20:10 states, "And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever." This passage emphasizes the finality of Satan's defeat and his eternal punishment.

Additionally, the promise of Satan's defeat can be seen as far back as Genesis 3:15, which is often referred to as the "protoevangelium" or the first gospel. It speaks of enmity between the serpent (representing Satan) and the woman, and it foretells that her offspring would ultimately crush the serpent's head, signifying a decisive victory over evil.

These scriptures collectively affirm the Christian promise that Satan's reign will come to an end, and God will ultimately establish His kingdom in which righteousness prevails. This assurance gives hope to believers regarding the ultimate triumph of good over evil.

Comment: The response effectively references key biblical passages, such as Revelation 20:10 and Genesis 3:15, to support the claim that God's promise of the defeat of Satan through the Messiah offers hope and assurance to Christians. The explanation is clear, well-supported by scripture, and aligns well with a Christian worldview emphasizing God's sovereignty and ultimate triumph over evil. Great job!
