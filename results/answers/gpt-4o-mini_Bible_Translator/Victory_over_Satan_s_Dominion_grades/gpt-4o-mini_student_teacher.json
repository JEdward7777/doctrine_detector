  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response that delves into the significance of Jesus' death on the cross regarding Satan's dominion. While the answer includes various biblical references and theological insights, it slightly deviates from the simplicity and directness of the reference answer provided by the teacher, expanding beyond the given concern. The student effectively captures the broader implications of Christ's victory for believers, but could have focused more on succinctly addressing the specific concern at hand."
