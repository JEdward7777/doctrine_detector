It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the implications of Christ's victory for believers, such as the restoration of the relationship with God, empowerment to resist sin, and participation in God's kingdom. The references to key biblical passages and the comprehensive overview of the theological significance of Christ's sacrifice demonstrate a strong understanding of Christianity's worldview."
