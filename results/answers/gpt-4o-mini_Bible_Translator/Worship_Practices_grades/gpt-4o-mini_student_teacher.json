  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 85.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive list of modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of God, expanding beyond material possessions and wealth to include relationships, entertainment, self, technology, ideology, and tradition. They also highlight the importance of examining one's heart and priorities to ensure that God remains at the center of one's life. \n\nWhile the student covers a wide range of potential modern idols and emphasizes the need for self-reflection and prioritizing God, they could further strengthen their answer by directly connecting each example to the concern of prioritizing devotion to God. By making this connection more explicit throughout their response, the student could provide a more focused analysis aligned with the Christian worldview."
