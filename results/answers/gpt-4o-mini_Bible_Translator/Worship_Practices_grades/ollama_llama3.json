The examples are well-supported with biblical principles, making it easy for readers to understand the concept of idolatry in a contemporary context.\n\nThe response also emphasizes the importance of regular examination of one's heart and priorities, which aligns with the concern that Christians should prioritize their devotion to God above all else.
