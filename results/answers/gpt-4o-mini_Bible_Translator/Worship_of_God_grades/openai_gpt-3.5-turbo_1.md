## Question [Worship of God](../../../questions/Worship_of_God.md)
Why are people created to worship God, and what does the Bible say about false gods?

People were created to worship God, the only true God, as indicated in the Bible. False gods are described as nonliving idols that people mistakenly worship, detracting from the true worship of Yahweh.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of worshiping the true God helps us avoid the pitfalls of idolatry in our lives.

## [Answer](../Worship_of_God.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that people are created for the purpose of glorifying God and enjoying a relationship with Him. This concept is particularly emphasized in passages like Isaiah 43:7, where it states that God created people for His glory. Worshiping God is integral to recognizing His sovereignty, goodness, and love; it aligns believers with their intended purpose.

Regarding false gods, the Bible consistently warns against idolatryâ€”worshiping anything other than the one true God. In the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:3-6), God commands His followers not to have any other gods before Him. Idolatry is seen as a rejection of God's rightful place and often leads to moral and spiritual degradation. Throughout Scripture, false gods (often represented by physical idols or earthly desires) are depicted as powerless and misleading. For instance, in Psalm 115:4-8, the psalmist contrasts the living God with idols, stating that they have no breath, eyes, or ears, emphasizing their inability to offer aid or answer prayers.

In summary, humans are created to worship the true God, and the Bible warns against the dangers and futility of worshiping false gods, urging believers to keep God at the center of their lives.
