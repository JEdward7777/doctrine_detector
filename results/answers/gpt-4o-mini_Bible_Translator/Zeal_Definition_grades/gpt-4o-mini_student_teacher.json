  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that aligns well with the reference answer and demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of zeal within Christian teachings. The student effectively incorporates relevant biblical references to support their explanation and emphasizes the importance of pairing zeal with love, wisdom, and adherence to sound doctrine. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include more emphasis on the aspect of actively promoting a good cause in their definition of zeal, as mentioned in the reference answer."
