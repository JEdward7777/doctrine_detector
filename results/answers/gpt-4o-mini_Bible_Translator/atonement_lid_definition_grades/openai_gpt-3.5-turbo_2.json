The response effectively illustrates how the mercy seat symbolically represents God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament, highlighting the connection to God's redemption of sinful humanity through the sacrificial system. The incorporation of biblical references and theological insights from a Christian worldview enhances the depth of the analysis. Great job in addressing the concern with clarity and depth."
