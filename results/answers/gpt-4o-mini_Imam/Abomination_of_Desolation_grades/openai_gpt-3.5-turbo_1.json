However, the majority of the response focuses on providing context from a Muslim perspective rather than addressing the specific concern about the seriousness of defiling God's sacred spaces from a Christian viewpoint. It could have delved deeper into the implications for Christians and emphasized the need for spiritual discernment and obedience in interpreting and responding to prophetic signs in the Bible."
