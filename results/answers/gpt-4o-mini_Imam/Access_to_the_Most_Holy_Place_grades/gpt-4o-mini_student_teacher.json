  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written and informative response about the Islamic tradition regarding the Kaaba, but fails to address the specific Christian viewpoint requested in the concern provided. The answer also lacks the key Christian perspective that emphasizes the exclusive role of the high priest in entering the 'most holy place' to represent the people before God. The grade is low due to the significant deviation from the Christian-specific worldview required in the answer."
