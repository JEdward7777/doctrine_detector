  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of recognizing the holiness of God and the importance of maintaining sacred spaces. It effectively highlights the significance of ritual purity, tradition, and spiritual significance in restricting access to the Kaaba. The symbolism of exclusivity is also well-explored, emphasizing the special status of the Kaaba as the house of Allah.\n\nHowever, while the response acknowledges the importance of recognizing God's holiness, it doesn't directly tie this concept back to the specific protocols for approaching Him. While the answer does mention the Prophet Muhammad's emphasis on maintaining certain standards in sacred spaces, it could be further developed by exploring how these protocols reflect a deep understanding of God's nature and His desire for reverence.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of recognizing God's holiness and the necessary protocols for approaching Him, but could benefit from a more explicit connection between the two."
