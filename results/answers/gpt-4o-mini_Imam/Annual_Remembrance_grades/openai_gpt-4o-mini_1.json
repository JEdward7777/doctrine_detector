  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the annual celebration of Passover in the Bible, highlighting the importance of remembrance, covenant with God, education of future generations, celebration of community, and spiritual reflection. The incorporation of biblical references and the connection to Christian faith's emphasis on remembrance enhances the quality of the response. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie in the importance of remembrance in the context of Christian faith, but overall, this is a well-written and insightful response."
