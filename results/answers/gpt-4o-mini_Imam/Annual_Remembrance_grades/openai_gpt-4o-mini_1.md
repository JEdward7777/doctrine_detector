## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Bible, the celebration of Passover by the Israelites was commanded as a means of commemorating and remembering their deliverance from slavery in Egypt. This event is described primarily in the Book of Exodus, particularly in Exodus 12.

Here are some key reasons for the annual celebration of Passover:

1. **Remembrance of Deliverance**: Passover marks the remembrance of the Israelites' liberation from bondage in Egypt. God instructed them to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood so that the Angel of Death would "pass over" their homes during the tenth plague, which resulted in the death of the firstborn of Egypt (Exodus 12:12-13). This act of remembrance serves as a powerful symbol of freedom and divine intervention.

2. **Covenant with God**: The practice of commemorating Passover reinforced the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites. By observing this command, the Israelites affirm their identity as a chosen people who have seen God's saving power in their lives.

3. **Education of Future Generations**: The yearly observance serves as a teaching moment for each generation. The instructions included in the Passover observance encourage families to explain to their children the significance of the festival and the events surrounding the Exodus (Exodus 12:26-27). This helps to pass down the history and lessons of faith from one generation to the next.

4. **Celebration of Community**: Passover is also a time of gathering, where families and communities come together to celebrate. This fosters a sense of unity and shared heritage among the people, strengthening their cultural and religious identity.

5. **Spiritual Reflection**: Beyond the historical aspect, Passover becomes a moment for spiritual reflection on themes of redemption, sacrifice, and God's faithfulness. For many, it symbolizes hope and the promise of liberation from all forms of bondage.

In conclusion, the annual celebration of Passover is deeply rooted in the history and faith of the Israelites, providing them with an opportunity for remembrance, education, community bonding, and spiritual reflection.
