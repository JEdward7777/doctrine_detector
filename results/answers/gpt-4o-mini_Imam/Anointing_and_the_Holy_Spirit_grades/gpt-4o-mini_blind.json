However, it lacks clarity in defining the Christian understanding of receiving the Holy Spirit through anointing, focusing more on the comparison with Islamic beliefs. The response does acknowledge the differences in theological frameworks but doesn't delve deeply into the specific Christian perspective on the topic. More emphasis on the biblical basis and significance of receiving the Holy Spirit through anointing would have strengthened the answer."
