  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a general overview of the concept of antichrist from a Christian perspective but did not directly address the specific concern about traits defining antichrists according to the Apostle John. The student also included unrelated information about Islamic beliefs which was unnecessary in this context. The answer lacked depth and specificity, resulting in a lower grade."
