  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and well-written explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the significance of apostles in spreading the message of Jesus. While the response is informative and well-organized, it does not directly address the Christian-specific context of the apostles being sent by Jesus to preach about God and his kingdom with the authority of Christ. The answer lacks integration of the Christian worldview, which is essential for answering the question in the context of the Great Commission."
