It connects the Islamic beliefs about prophets and communities to the role of the apostles in disseminating the message of Jesus. However, the response could have more directly addressed the concern about the Great Commission from a Christian worldview, emphasizing the specific authority given to the apostles by Jesus to spread the Gospel to all nations. By focusing more on the Christian understanding of apostleship within the context of the Great Commission, the response could have been more aligned with the specified concern."
