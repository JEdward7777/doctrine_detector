  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: While the student provides a comprehensive overview of common values in Christianity and Islam related to reconciliation, their answer lacks specificity in applying the principle of reconciliation in daily life from a Christian perspective. The response mainly focuses on general principles shared by multiple faiths, rather than delving deeply into the Christian-specific aspects of reconciliation. Additionally, the student could have included more references to biblical passages and teachings to support their points. Overall, while the effort is commendable, the response falls short in addressing the concern in a Christian-specific context."
