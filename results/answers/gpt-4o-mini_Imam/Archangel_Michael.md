In the Bible, the only angel explicitly referred to as an "archangel" is Michael. This title is mentioned in the New Testament, specifically in the Book of Jude (Jude 1:9), where it states, "But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not presume to pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'" 

In Islamic tradition, Michael (known as Mikail) is also recognized as one of the key angels, responsible for providing nourishment to human bodies and souls, as well as overseeing natural phenomena. Both Christian and Islamic teachings emphasize the important roles that angels like Michael play in God's creation.
