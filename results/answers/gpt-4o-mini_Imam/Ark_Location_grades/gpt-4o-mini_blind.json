The focus should have been on the biblical account of the Ark's location in the tabernacle as described in the Old Testament, rather than Islamic traditions. Additionally, the description of the Most Holy Place and the High Priest's access to it is accurate, but overall, the answer misses the mark by not emphasizing the Christian understanding and significance of the Ark within the tabernacle."
