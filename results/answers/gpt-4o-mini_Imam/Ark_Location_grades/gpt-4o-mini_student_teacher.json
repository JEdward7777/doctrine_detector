  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate response regarding the location of the Ark of the Covenant in the tabernacle, understanding its significance in both Islamic and Judeo-Christian contexts. However, the response did not directly address the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God within this specific worldview, which was the main concern highlighted. It would have been beneficial for the student to connect the location of the Ark to the concept of God's presence and holiness in the most holy place from a Christian perspective."
