  "grade": 55.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComments: The student's response provides a general overview of the significance of the Ark of the Covenant in the Bible but fails to address its importance within a Christian worldview specifically. The inclusion of information about Islam's perspective, although respectful, is not relevant to the question. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of the Ark, such as its foreshadowing of Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity. It lacks doctrinal correctness and theological depth necessary for a higher grade."
