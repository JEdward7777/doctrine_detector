## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islam, belief in Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is an important part of faith, as he is considered one of the greatest prophets. Muslims believe that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary (Maryam) and performed many miracles by God's permission. However, it is essential to note that the Islamic perspective differs from the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God.

In the Quran, Jesus is mentioned as a messenger of God, and those who believe in him are encouraged to follow his teachings and the guidance he brought. The Quran emphasizes the importance of faith in one God (Allah) and acknowledges the role of Jesus in conveying God's message.

The assurance given to believers, which includes those who believe in all the prophets, including Jesus, can be derived from several Quranic verses. For example:

1. **Divine Mercy and Forgiveness:** The Quran assures believers of God's mercy and forgiveness. In Surah Al-Zumar (39:53), Allah invites those who have wronged themselves to not despair of His mercy.

2. **Reward of Paradise:** Believers who have faith and do righteous deeds are promised a place in Paradise. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:82), it states that those who believe and do good works will be rewarded and will dwell in Paradise.

3. **Protection from Fear and Grief:** In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:277), it mentions that those who believe and are patient will find reassurance in their faith and a refuge from fear and grief.

Overall, while the assurance for believers in Jesus specifically may not be explicitly stated, the broader context of faith in God and the prophets, including Jesus, emphasizes mercy, reward, and a promise of guidance and protection in this life and the hereafter.
