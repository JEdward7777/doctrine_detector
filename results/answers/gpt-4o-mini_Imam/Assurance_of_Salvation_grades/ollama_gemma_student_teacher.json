  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the Islamic perspective on faith and assurance. However, it lacks clarity in addressing the specific concern related to the assurance given to believers in Jesus Christ from a Christian worldview. While the student provides relevant information about Islamic beliefs and Quranic verses, it does not directly address the Christian understanding of salvation through faith in Jesus."
