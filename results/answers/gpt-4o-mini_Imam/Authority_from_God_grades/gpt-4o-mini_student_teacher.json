  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of 'divine authority' in the Islamic context and its significance in the life of a believer. They effectively discussed the concepts of guidance, purpose, accountability, peace, community, and moral framework in relation to divine authority. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern provided and relating the discussion more explicitly to the Christian worldview. By focusing on the specific aspect of discerning God's will and maintaining obedience, the student could have presented a more targeted and relevant response from a Christian perspective."
