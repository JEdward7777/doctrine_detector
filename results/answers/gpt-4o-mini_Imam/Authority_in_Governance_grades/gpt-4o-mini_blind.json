  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid overview of the Biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers over citizens, particularly drawing from Romans 13:1-7. The emphasis on divine establishment, the role of rulers, obedience to authorities, and consequences for disobedience is well articulated. Additionally, the reference to Proverbs 8:15-16 adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could be improved by including additional scriptural references that further support the points made. An enhanced analysis of how rulers are called to govern justly according to God's standards would also strengthen the answer."
