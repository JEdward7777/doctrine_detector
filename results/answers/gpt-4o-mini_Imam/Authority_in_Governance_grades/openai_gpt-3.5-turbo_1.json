  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the God-ordained structure of authority and the responsibility to obey based on the reference to Romans 13:1-2. It effectively highlights the key points from the Bible regarding the authority of governing rulers. The explanation is clear and well-supported with relevant scriptural references. The only minor improvement would be to provide a more explicit connection to the concern raised about our responsibility to obey authorities, although it is implied throughout the response. Overall, this is an excellent interpretation from a Christian worldview."
