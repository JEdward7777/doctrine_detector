It effectively highlights the key points from the biblical passage and emphasizes the divine establishment of governmental authority. The connection between God's ordination of rulers and our responsibility to obey them is clearly articulated in a coherent and insightful manner. This response aligns well with the concern regarding understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our obligation to obey. Great job!"
