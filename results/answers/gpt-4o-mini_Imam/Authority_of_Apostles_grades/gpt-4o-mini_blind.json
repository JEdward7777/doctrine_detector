However, from a Christian worldview, the answer misses the mark in addressing the authority of the apostles specifically within Christianity. It lacks the necessary focus on the unique authority given to the apostles by Jesus Christ Himself, as seen in passages like Matthew 10:1 and Luke 10:19. Additionally, the reference to \"peace be upon him\" in relation to Jesus and Muhammad is not consistent with Christian beliefs. The response could benefit from including how the apostles' authority, ability to perform miracles, and bold preaching were directly tied to the empowerment of the Holy Spirit and the commission given by Jesus."
