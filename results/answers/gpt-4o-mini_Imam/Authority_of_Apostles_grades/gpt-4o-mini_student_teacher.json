  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40 \n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation within an Islamic theological framework, which is well-written and informative. However, the answer did not address the concern of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles specifically within Christianity. The student's response focused on Islamic beliefs regarding prophets and messengers, which, while insightful, deviated from the Christian-specific worldview requested in the concern. It is important for the student to stay within the parameters of the specified concern when providing a response."
