The writer effectively demonstrates how these concepts are intertwined, highlighting their connection to divine authority, miraculous signs, and bold preaching.\n\nWhile the response does not explicitly address the concern of exploring divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, it indirectly touches on this theme through its discussion of the prophets' and messengers' roles. The writer does acknowledge the apostles' authority in Christianity and draws parallels with Islamic concepts, such as the companions of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nTo improve the response, consider explicitly addressing the concern by highlighting specific biblical passages that illustrate the divine empowerment and authority given to the apostles for ministry, as mentioned in the original answer (\"The apostles were empowered by God to boldly preach the gospel, heal people, and cast out demons...\"). This would help strengthen the connection between the two faiths and provide a more direct exploration of the concern."
