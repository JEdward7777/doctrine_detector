It effectively draws parallels between the apostles in Christianity and figures in Islamic theology, demonstrating a good understanding of the concern raised. However, it falls short of directly addressing the empowerment and authority specifically bestowed upon the apostles as described in the Christian context, hence the deduction in points."
