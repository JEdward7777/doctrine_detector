It effectively draws parallels between the concept of authority, miracles, and preaching in Islam and how they relate to the apostles in Christianity. The explanation provided is thorough and insightful, showcasing a deep understanding of the topic from both Islamic and Christian viewpoints. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how the apostles in Christianity specifically received their authority from Jesus, as that was a central aspect of the original concern."
