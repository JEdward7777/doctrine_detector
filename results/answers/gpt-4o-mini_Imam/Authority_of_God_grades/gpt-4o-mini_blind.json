However, the inclusion of a comparison with Allah in Islam could be misleading from a Christian worldview, as the attributes and nature of God in Christianity and Islam differ significantly. The response could have been stronger by focusing solely on the Christian understanding of God's authority over spiritual beings, without drawing parallels with other faith traditions."
