  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: While the response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"Yahweh of hosts\" in both Hebrew Bible and Islamic contexts, it falls short in addressing the concern provided. The concern highlighted the importance of understanding God's authority to deepen faith and trust in His omnipotence, which the response did not explicitly focus on. The explanation provided is insightful and informative but lacks a direct connection to how understanding God's authority can impact faith and trust."
