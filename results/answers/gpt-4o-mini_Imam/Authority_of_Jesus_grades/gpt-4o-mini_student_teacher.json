The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of Jesus' sovereignty and how it applies to believers acknowledging His authority in their lives. The student effectively uses biblical references and theological concepts to support their points. The response aligns closely with the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern outlined. Great job overall!"
