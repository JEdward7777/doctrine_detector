The points made about the fulfillment of prophecy, universal kingship, rejection and acceptance, the Kingdom of God, and the nature of His reign are all well-supported and align with a Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by showing how understanding Jesus' authority can lead believers to acknowledge His sovereignty in their lives."
