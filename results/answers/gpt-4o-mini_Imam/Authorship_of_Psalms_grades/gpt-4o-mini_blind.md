## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Psalms, which are primarily associated with the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh, key figures traditionally credited with authorship include:

1. **King David**: He is perhaps the most prominent figure associated with the Psalms, with many of the Psalms attributed to him, reflecting his experiences, emotions, and spiritual reflections.

2. **Asaph**: A prominent musician and a Levite, Asaph is attributed to several Psalms, particularly those focusing on worship and the majesty of God.

3. **The Sons of Korah**: This group was responsible for a number of Psalms that express themes of worship and lament.

4. **Solomon**: Some Psalms are thought to be written or compiled during the reign of Solomon, reflecting wisdom and teachings.

5. **Moses**: He is traditionally credited with Psalm 90, which is a prayer expressing the transience of human life.

6. **Various Anonymous Contributors**: Many Psalms remain anonymous, and it's acknowledged that various poets and singers may have contributed to the collection over time.

The Psalms are a significant part of the Jewish and Christian traditions, and they hold a place of reverence in these faiths. In Islam, although the Psalms are acknowledged with respect, the Qur'an mentions the Zabur (often understood to refer to the Psalms) given to Prophet Dawud (David), emphasizing his role as a servant of Allah and a prophet.
