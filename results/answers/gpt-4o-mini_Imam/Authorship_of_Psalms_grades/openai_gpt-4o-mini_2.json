  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response adequately expands on the key figures traditionally associated with the Psalms, providing additional context and information. By acknowledging the roles of figures like the Sons of Korah and various anonymous contributors, it demonstrates a well-rounded understanding of the authorship of the Psalms. However, it could further enhance understanding by delving deeper into how the authorship of specific Psalms contributes to the themes and messages conveyed throughout the collection."
