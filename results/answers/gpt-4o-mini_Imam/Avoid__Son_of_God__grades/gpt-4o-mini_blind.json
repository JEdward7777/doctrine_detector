However, the answer leans more towards accommodating cultural sensitivities rather than upholding doctrinal correctness. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to uphold the truth of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, as revealed in the Bible, even if it may not align with other religious beliefs. It is important to approach interfaith discussions with respect and understanding, but the priority should be on upholding the integrity of Christian beliefs rather than diluting them for the sake of cultural harmony."
