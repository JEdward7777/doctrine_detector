  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has presented a thoughtful and well-articulated response that showcases an understanding of the concerns surrounding the term 'Son of God' in polytheistic cultures. While the student acknowledges the potential for misunderstandings and advocates for using neutral language to prevent confusion, the teacher's perspective from a Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of teaching and explaining the true meaning behind the term rather than avoiding it altogether. The student's answer could benefit from incorporating how teaching and explaining the term 'Son of God' can bridge theological gaps and provide a deeper understanding of Jesus' identity within a Christian context."
