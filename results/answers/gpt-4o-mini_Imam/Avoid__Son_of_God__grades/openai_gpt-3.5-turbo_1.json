  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: This response provides a thoughtful consideration of the implications of using the term 'Son of God' in differing religious contexts, specifically in relation to Islamic beliefs. The student effectively discusses the potential for confusion or misinterpretation and the importance of cultural sensitivity in interfaith dialogues. However, the response does not directly address the concern that avoidance of the term can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. While the student presents a valid perspective on using more neutral language, they do not fully engage with the idea that teaching the meaning of the term through context and explanation can help bridge theological gaps. The response could be enhanced by acknowledging the necessity of addressing potential misunderstandings while still respecting the theological differences between Christianity and Islam."
