  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful consideration of the implications of using the term 'Son of God' in an Islamic context and the importance of cultural sensitivity in interfaith dialogues. While the response suggests avoiding the term and opting for more neutral language, it fails to sufficiently address the concern that avoidance can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity from a Christian perspective. A higher grade could be achieved by acknowledging the concern more directly and offering a balanced approach that incorporates both cultural sensitivity and accurate theological representation."
