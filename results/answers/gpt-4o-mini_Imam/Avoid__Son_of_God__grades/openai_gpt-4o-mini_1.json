While the suggested approach is respectful and sensitive to differing beliefs, it does raise valid concerns about potential theological gaps and misunderstandings that could arise from avoiding the term 'Son of God'. The response could strengthen its argument by acknowledging the importance of teaching the meaning of the term within its Christian theological context while still respecting the sensitivities of other faith traditions."
