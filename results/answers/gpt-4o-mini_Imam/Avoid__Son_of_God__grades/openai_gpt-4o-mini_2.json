  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the concern about potential misunderstandings regarding Jesus' identity if the term 'Son of God' is avoided, which is important from a Christian worldview perspective. However, the focus of the response is more on advocating for using neutral language to avoid confusion, rather than emphasizing the importance of teaching and explaining the true meaning of the term within Christianity. It could have been stronger by more explicitly emphasizing the foundational Christian belief that Jesus is the literal Son of God."
