  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and comprehensive overview of the different methods of baptism mentioned in the Bible and offers insightful interpretations within various Christian contexts. However, there is a significant deviation from the given reference answer as the student includes extraneous information about the Qur'an and interfaith dialogue which detracts from the main focus on the interpretations and methods of baptism within Christianity. Focusing more on the core aspects of baptism in Christian contexts would have strengthened the response."
