The response effectively highlighted key points such as baptism being a symbol of faith and repentance, identification with Christ, initiation into the Christian community, obedience to Christ's command, and spiritual cleansing and new birth. The inclusion of relevant Bible references strengthened the theological foundation of the discussion. The student's effort to acknowledge the differences in belief systems between Islam and Christianity also showed respect for diversity while maintaining a focus on Christian teachings. Great job overall!"
