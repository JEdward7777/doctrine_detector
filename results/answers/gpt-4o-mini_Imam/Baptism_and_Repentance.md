## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, repentance (Tawbah) is a crucial part of a believer’s relationship with Allah. It involves acknowledging one’s sins, feeling genuine remorse, asking Allah for forgiveness, and making a commitment to avoid those sins in the future. This concept echoes in various religious traditions, including Christianity.

In the New Testament, baptism is closely associated with repentance. For instance, John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4). The act of baptism symbolizes not only a cleansing from sin but also an inward transformation and a commitment to a new way of life. In this context, the act of being baptized represents an outward expression of an inward change, indicating that the individual is turning away from sin and turning towards God.

While there are similarities in the concepts of repentance in both Islam and Christianity, there are also key differences. In Islam, repentance is directly between the person and Allah, who is All-Forgiving. In Christianity, particularly in the New Testament, baptism serves as a sacrament that is often seen as a necessary step for receiving salvation, linking physical ritual with spiritual rebirth.

In summary, while both repentance in Islam and baptism in Christianity relate to turning away from sin and seeking a relationship with God, they do so within differing theological frameworks and understandings of the processes involved in forgiveness and salvation. In Islam, the focus is more on direct repentance without the requirement of ritual acts like baptism, whereas, in Christianity, baptism is integral to the practice of faith and a visible sign of one's commitment to a new life in Christ.
