However, the focus should have been on explaining the Christian doctrine specifically without diluting it with comparisons to other religions. The answer could have been improved by highlighting the Christian belief that repentance is a necessary precursor to baptism for believers to demonstrate a turning away from sin and a commitment to following Christ."
