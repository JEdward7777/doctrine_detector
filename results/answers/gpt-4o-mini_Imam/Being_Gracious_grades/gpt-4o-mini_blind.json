  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70 \n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer on the term 'gracious' and its implications on interactions with others. The explanation of the qualities of graciousness and how they play out in our interactions was well-articulated. However, the response deviated from a Christian specific worldview by incorporating references to Islamic teachings and beliefs. To improve the grade, the student should focus on providing a Christian perspective on graciousness, using Bible verses or teachings from Jesus to support their points."
