While these qualities are commendable and align with Islamic teachings, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern from a Christian perspective. In Christianity, forgiveness and kindness are seen as obligations based on the example of Jesus Christ, who demonstrated ultimate forgiveness and love even towards those who wronged Him. Connecting the concept of graciousness to Christian teachings and the importance of embodying these virtues in accordance with God's grace would have strengthened the response."
