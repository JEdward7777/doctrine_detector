## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The Pharisees were a religious and political group among the Jews during the Second Temple period, and they are often contrasted with the Sadducees. They held distinct beliefs, particularly regarding life after death and spiritual beings. 

1. **Afterlife Beliefs**: The Pharisees believed in the resurrection of the dead. They held that there would be a future resurrection at the end of times, where the righteous would be rewarded and the wicked punished. This belief is rooted in various Hebrew Scriptures that they interpreted as indicating an afterlife, such as Daniel 12:2, which speaks of some rising to everlasting life and others to shame and everlasting contempt.

2. **Spiritual Beings**: The Pharisees acknowledged the existence of spiritual beings, which included angels and demons. They viewed angels as messengers and servants of God, involved in the affairs of the world. Their writings suggest a belief in both good and evil spiritual forces, reflecting a dualistic understanding of the spiritual realm.

3. **Importance of the Oral Law**: The Pharisees believed in the Oral Law, as well as the written Torah. They thought that the Oral Law provided additional insight into spiritual matters, including the afterlife, and sought to apply these teachings to daily life.

4. **Moral and Ethical Focus**: Their beliefs also emphasized ethical living and adherence to the commandments as a way to participate in the promises of the afterlife. They taught that one's actions in this life had implications for the next.

These beliefs played a significant role in shaping early Jewish thought and later influenced early Christianity, particularly in concepts related to resurrection and judgment.
