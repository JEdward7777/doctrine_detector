The student accurately presents the Pharisees' belief in the resurrection of the dead, their acknowledgment of spiritual beings like angels and demons, as well as the importance of the Oral Law and ethical living. The answer effectively connects these beliefs to early Jewish thought and their influence on early Christianity. One area for improvement could be to delve deeper into the Pharisees' specific teachings and practices related to these beliefs, providing more detailed examples or references."
