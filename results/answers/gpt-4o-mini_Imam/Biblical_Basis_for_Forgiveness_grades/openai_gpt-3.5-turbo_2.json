  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of key Bible verses that emphasize the importance of forgiveness among believers, drawing from Matthew 6:14-15, Ephesians 4:32, and Colossians 3:13 as requested. The explanation is clear and concise, demonstrating a strong understanding of forgiveness in the Christian faith. The inclusion of relevant verses and their explanations align well with the concern raised. However, a direct reference to Colossians 3:12-14, as mentioned in the provided answer, is missing in the response, which slightly affects the grade."
