  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, citing relevant passages and emphasizing their role in serving the church community. However, the student did not directly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, which was the specific focus of the question. Connecting the responsibilities of deacons to the fair distribution of resources, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer, would have strengthened the response."
