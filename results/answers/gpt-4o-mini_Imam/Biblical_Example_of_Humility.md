## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic teachings, humility is a highly regarded trait, and while I answer primarily from a Muslim perspective, I recognize the common values shared across the Abrahamic faiths.

One prominent biblical example of humility is that of Moses (Musa in Arabic). He is described in the Bible as "very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth" (Numbers 12:3, ESV). Throughout his life, Moses demonstrated humility in many ways, particularly in his leadership of the Israelites. Despite being chosen by Allah (God) to deliver His message and lead His people out of Egypt, Moses often placed the needs of his community above his own desires and recognized his reliance on God for guidance and strength.

Similar to the way humility is emphasized in Islamic teachings, Mosesâ€™ conduct can serve as a model of how true leadership involves serving others with a humble heart and recognizing one's limitations in the face of divine authority. This aligns with the Islamic teaching that true greatness lies in being humble, serving others, and maintaining a close relationship with Allah.

In summary, Moses stands out as a biblical figure who beautifully exemplifies humility, and his life can be a source of inspiration in both Christian and Islamic traditions.
