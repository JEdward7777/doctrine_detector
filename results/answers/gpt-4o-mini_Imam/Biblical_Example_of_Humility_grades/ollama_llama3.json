  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 75.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of providing concrete examples of humility in the scriptures, specifically referencing Moses' life and actions as described in the Bible. The connection between Moses' humility and Islamic teachings is also well-handled, showing a clear understanding of both biblical and Quranic perspectives on humility. The summary effectively highlights Moses as a model of humble leadership.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly address the concern about David being an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God. While David's character is mentioned in passing, there is no direct analysis or application of his life to illustrate humility. A higher grade would require a more explicit connection between David's example and the concern about finding tangible examples of humility in scriptures.\n\nThe comment on this grade: \"This response demonstrates a good understanding of biblical and Islamic teachings on humility but falls short in explicitly addressing the concern about David being an example of humility. To improve, consider directly analyzing David's life and actions to illustrate humility and connect it to the broader concern.\""
