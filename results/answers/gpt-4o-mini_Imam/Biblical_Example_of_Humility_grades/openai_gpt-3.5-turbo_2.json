By drawing parallels between the humility exemplified by Moses in the Bible and the importance of humility in Islamic tradition, the response effectively addresses the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. It expands upon the initial answer while maintaining a focus on humility within a Christian worldview. Well done!"
