  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good understanding of how blessings are illustrated in scripture by referencing specific verses from the Book of Genesis. However, the student's answer could have been more focused on the specific example provided in the reference answer, rather than offering a more general perspective. Additionally, while the student acknowledged their primary training in the Islamic context, a stronger connection could have been made to how blessings are viewed within a Christian worldview."
