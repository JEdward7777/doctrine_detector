  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The student provided an answer that focused on Islamic teachings regarding Jesus rather than examples from Scripture. While the content regarding Jesus's innocence and the false accusations against him in the Quran is informative, it does not directly address the question of providing examples from Scripture. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, it is important to prioritize examples from the Bible when discussing theological concepts related to Jesus. Thus, the student's response is not aligned with the specific request of the question."
