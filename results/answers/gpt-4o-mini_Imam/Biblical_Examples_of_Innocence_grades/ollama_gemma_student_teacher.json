  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on Jesus's innocence and the accusations he faced. It provides relevant textual evidence from the Quran to support the claim that Jesus was regarded as innocent in Islamic teachings. The student also acknowledges the differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific instances from Scripture that illustrate the idea of Jesus's innocence, as referenced in the teacher's answer."
