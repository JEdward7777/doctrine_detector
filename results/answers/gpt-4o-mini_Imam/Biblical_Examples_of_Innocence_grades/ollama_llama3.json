While it does not directly address the concern about Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence, the provided examples from the Quran demonstrate a similar emphasis on Jesus' purity and faithfulness.\n\nThe response could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern and providing direct connections to the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence.
