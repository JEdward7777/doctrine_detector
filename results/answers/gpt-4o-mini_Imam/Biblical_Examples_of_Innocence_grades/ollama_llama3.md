## Question [Biblical Examples of Innocence](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md)
Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

## Stated Concern
These examples serve to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic teachings, Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) is regarded as a significant prophet, and the Quran presents his character with great respect. While the Quran does not detail the crucifixion and trial of Jesus in the same manner as the New Testament, it does speak to his innocence and the false accusations made against him.

1. **The Innocence of Jesus**: In the Quran, Jesus is described as a prophet born of a virgin, performing miracles by the permission of Allah, which emphasizes his miraculous nature and innocence. For example, Surah Al-Imran (3:45-47) recounts the announcement of Jesus's miraculous birth and his role as a sign for mankind:
   - “When the angels said, 'O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary - distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those who are near [to Allah ]. He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous.'”

2. **Accusations Against Jesus**: In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:110), Allah speaks to Jesus on the Day of Judgment about the miracles he performed and the disbelief shown by some among the Children of Israel, demonstrating that despite his innocence and the signs shown to them, they still accused him:
   - “The Day when Allah will say, ‘O Jesus, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Pure Spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and [remember] when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel, and when you design from clay [what is] like the form of a bird, then you breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by permission of Allah ; and you heal the blind and the leper, and when you bring forth the dead by permission of Allah ; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from [killing] you when you came to them with clear proofs and those who disbelieved among them said, ‘This is not but obvious magic.’”

3. **Defenders of Innocence**: The Quran emphasizes that Jesus's innocence is acknowledged by Allah and that there were those who believed in him. His actual disciples (Hawariyyun) are recognized as followers who believed in his mission and defended him against accusations, as mentioned in Surah Al-Saff (61:14):
   - “O you who have believed, be supporters of Allah, as when Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the disciples, ‘Who are my supporters for [the cause of] Allah ?’ The disciples said, ‘We are supporters of Allah. We have believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims.’”

While the Bible describes Jesus's trial and the false accusations made against him in more detail, the Islamic tradition emphasizes his prophethood, his purity, and the faith of his true followers. These themes underscore that ultimately, the truth of Jesus's message and his innocence was recognized by those who truly believed in him.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a detailed and respectful exploration of Jesus' innocence in Islamic teachings, highlighting key Quranic passages that emphasize his miraculous birth, miracles, and ultimately, his innocence despite false accusations. While it does not directly address the concern about Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence, the provided examples from the Quran demonstrate a similar emphasis on Jesus' purity and faithfulness.

The response could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern and providing direct connections to the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence. However, the overall presentation is clear, well-organized, and demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic teachings related to Jesus.
