It effectively contrasts the Islamic perspective with a Christian-specific example from the New Testament. However, it could further strengthen the Christian worldview by explicitly highlighting the theological significance of Jesus' innocence in Christian belief, tying it back to the overall message of redemption and salvation through Jesus Christ."
