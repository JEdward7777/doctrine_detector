The examples given, such as Job, David, Jeremiah, Jesus, and the Woman of Nain, are relevant and well-explained. The student effectively draws out key lessons regarding honesty in lament, communal grief, hope in suffering, and empathy. The integration of a Muslim context at the end could have been omitted to maintain a more focused and purely Christian worldview perspective. Assimilating the insights into a broader cultural and interfaith context might dilute the foundational principles of the Christian worldview."
