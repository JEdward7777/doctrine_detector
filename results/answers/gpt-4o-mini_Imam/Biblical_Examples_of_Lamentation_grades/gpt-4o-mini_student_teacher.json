  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer identifying key Biblical figures who expressed lament and offering insightful lessons from their examples. They successfully connected the concept of biblical lamentation to personal growth and a deeper relationship with God, highlighting the importance of honesty, community, hope, empathy, and compassion in the process of lament. The only area for improvement would be to directly reference the teacher's answer in a clearer manner to demonstrate a deeper understanding and application of the specified concern. Overall, a well-thought-out response with a strong biblical foundation."
