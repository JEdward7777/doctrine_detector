  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-researched and detailed response that effectively highlights the power and importance of prayer from a Christian perspective. The examples chosen from the Bible are relevant and help illustrate the significance of prayer in one's relationship with God. The student also nicely acknowledges the similarities in the concept of prayer across Abrahamic faiths. The only area for improvement would be to incorporate more direct references to the doctrinal teachings on prayer within Christianity to enhance the theological depth of the response."
