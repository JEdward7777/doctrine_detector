  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response with relevant examples from the Bible that illustrate the power and importance of prayer. However, the examples given by the teacher in the reference answer were more concise and directly related to the question. The student did well in drawing parallels between Islamic and Christian views on prayer but could have focused more on the specific examples requested in the question."
