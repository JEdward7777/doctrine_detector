  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student did a good job in providing examples from the Bible that demonstrate the act of repentance. However, the response could have been stronger by focusing more on Christian doctrine and teachings rather than bringing in comparisons to Islamic beliefs. Additionally, there were missed opportunities to further elaborate on the theological significance and implications of repentance within a Christian worldview. Overall, a decent effort but room for improvement in terms of depth and doctrinal specificity."
