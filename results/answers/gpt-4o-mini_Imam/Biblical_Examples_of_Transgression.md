## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Bible, the concept of transgression generally refers to the act of violating a command, a moral law, or a covenant. Here are a few key biblical references that illustrate this concept:

1. **Psalm 51:1-2**: David, in his penitential psalm, writes, "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin." Here, David acknowledges his transgressions before God and seeks forgiveness.

2. **Isaiah 59:2**: This verse states, "But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear." This passage illustrates how transgressions can create a barrier between humanity and God.

3. **1 John 3:4**: The New Testament defines sin by saying, "Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness." This emphasizes that transgressions are acts against divine law.

4. **Romans 5:14**: Here, Paul writes, "Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam." This refers to the original sin and highlights the idea of transgression as a direct violation of Godâ€™s command.

5. **James 2:9**: This verse states, "But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors." It indicates that transgression occurs not just through actions but also through attitudes and failures to uphold the laws of God.

These verses collectively demonstrate the seriousness of transgressions in a biblical context, underlining the themes of sin, separation from God, and the need for repentance and forgiveness.
