  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. \n\nWhile the student provided relevant biblical references and effectively explained the concept of transgression, they missed out on key references highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. By not including some significant verses like 1 Thessalonians 4:6, Daniel 9:24-25, and Psalm 32:1, the student's response lacks comprehensive coverage of the topic. Encouraging the student to expand their research and inclusion of a wider range of biblical examples would enhance the depth and accuracy of their response."
