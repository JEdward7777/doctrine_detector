  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of transgression from a Christian perspective. They effectively identify relevant biblical references and explain the significance of transgression as an act of violating God's commands, laws, or covenants. The inclusion of passages that highlight the consequences of transgression, such as separation from God and the need for repentance, adds depth to the analysis. However, including additional references suggested by the teacher would have strengthened the overall breadth of the response."
