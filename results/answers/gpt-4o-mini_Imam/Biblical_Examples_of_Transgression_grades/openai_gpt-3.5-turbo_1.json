The inclusion of various verses from both the Old and New Testaments helps to paint a comprehensive picture of transgression as seen through a Christian worldview. However, the response could have been enhanced by directly addressing the concern of learning from biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls in one's life. Connecting the discussed biblical references to practical applications for individuals to learn from and apply in their own lives would have further strengthened the response."
