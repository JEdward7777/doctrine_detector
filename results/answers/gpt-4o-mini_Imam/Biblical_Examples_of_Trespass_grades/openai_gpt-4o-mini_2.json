The integration of both Old and New Testament passages enriches the discussion and enhances understanding. However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern by explicitly linking the examples provided to implications of believers' actions and God's forgiveness. A more explicit connection between the chosen biblical examples and their implications for believers could further strengthen the response."
