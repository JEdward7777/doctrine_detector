The answer does well in connecting the theme to other Abrahamic faiths such as Islam. However, the response would benefit from a stronger emphasis on how idol worship is negatively contrasted with true worship in the Christian context, as well as a more explicit articulation of the theological implications of idol worship in Christianity. Additionally, it could further explore the consequences or warnings associated with idol worship in the Bible."
