## Question [Biblical Examples of Worship](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md)
Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, a notable example of worship being contrasted with idol worship can be found in the book of Exodus, particularly in Exodus 20:3-6, which is part of the Ten Commandments. In these verses, God commands the Israelites not to have any other gods besides Him and forbids the making of idols:

"You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God..."

This passage clearly emphasizes the worship of the one true God in contrast to the worship of idols or images, highlighting the importance of monotheism in the Abrahamic faiths. This theme continues throughout the scriptures, where fidelity to God is often contrasted with the temptation of idol worship, indicating that true worship involves a commitment to God alone, without the association of created images or false deities. 

From a Muslim perspective, this aligns with the core belief in Tawhid, the oneness of God, and the rejection of any form of shirk (associating partners with God), which is considered a grave sin in Islam.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the contrast between worship and idol worship in the Bible, specifically referencing Exodus 20:3-6. However, the inclusion of the perspective from Islam deviates from the Christian worldview focus of the question, and the answer could have been more concise by sticking closely to the specific example given in Exodus 20:3.
