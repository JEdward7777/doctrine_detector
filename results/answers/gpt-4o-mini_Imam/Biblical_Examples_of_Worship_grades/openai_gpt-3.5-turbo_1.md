## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
Certainly! In the Bible, a notable example of worship being contrasted with idol worship can be found in the book of Exodus, particularly in Exodus 20:3-6, which is part of the Ten Commandments. In these verses, God commands the Israelites not to have any other gods besides Him and forbids the making of idols:

"You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God..."

This passage clearly emphasizes the worship of the one true God in contrast to the worship of idols or images, highlighting the importance of monotheism in the Abrahamic faiths. This theme continues throughout the scriptures, where fidelity to God is often contrasted with the temptation of idol worship, indicating that true worship involves a commitment to God alone, without the association of created images or false deities. 

From a Muslim perspective, this aligns with the core belief in Tawhid, the oneness of God, and the rejection of any form of shirk (associating partners with God), which is considered a grave sin in Islam.
