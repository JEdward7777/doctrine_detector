However, the answer primarily focuses on the Islamic perspective rather than examining and emphasizing the specifics of Jesus' directive as recorded in the New Testament. Additionally, the final paragraph seems to prioritize the Islamic viewpoint over the Christian perspective, which may lead to confusion or misunderstanding in a Christian-specific context. The answer would benefit from a more thorough discussion of Jesus' specific instructions to his apostles from Christian teachings."
