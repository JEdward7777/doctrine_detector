## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Islamic context, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is regarded as a prophet who brought the message of God to the Children of Israel. One of the key directives that he provided to his apostles was to spread the message of the good news, or the Gospel, which includes teachings of worshiping one God and living a righteous life according to God's commandments.

In the Christian tradition, specifically in the New Testament, Jesus instructed his apostles to go out into the world and preach the good news to all nations. This directive is commonly linked to the Great Commission, found in Matthew 28:19-20, where Jesus tells his disciples to make disciples of all nations. 

From an Islamic perspective, while we honor Jesus as a great prophet and messenger of God, we also emphasize the finality of the message delivered by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the last of the prophets, which complements and builds upon the earlier revelations, including that of Jesus.

Grade: 50

Comment: The response provides a general overview of the directive given by Jesus to his apostles regarding spreading the good news in both Islamic and Christian contexts. However, the answer primarily focuses on the Islamic perspective rather than examining and emphasizing the specifics of Jesus' directive as recorded in the New Testament. Additionally, the final paragraph seems to prioritize the Islamic viewpoint over the Christian perspective, which may lead to confusion or misunderstanding in a Christian-specific context. The answer would benefit from a more thorough discussion of Jesus' specific instructions to his apostles from Christian teachings.
