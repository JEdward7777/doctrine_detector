## [Answer](../Biblical_Fulfillment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The title “King of the Jews” ascribed to Jesus in the New Testament can be understood through various Old Testament prophecies that establish the framework for the coming of a messianic king. In Islamic tradition, we acknowledge Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) as one of the great prophets and recognize that many of these texts can hold significance in understanding the continuity of God's message.

1. **Messianic Expectations**: The Old Testament contains numerous prophecies regarding a future messiah, a king from the line of David who would restore Israel and establish God’s kingdom. For example, Jeremiah 23:5-6 speaks of a Branch raised from David’s line, who will reign wisely and will be called "The Lord Our Righteous Savior." 

2. **Genealogy**: The genealogical references in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke trace Jesus’ lineage back to David, reinforcing His rightful claim to the title of king, as foretold in prophecies like 2 Samuel 7:12-16, where God promises David that his throne will be established forever.

3. **The Prophecy of a Universal King**: Isaiah 9:6-7 speaks of a child to be born who will be called “Mighty God,” “Everlasting Father,” and “Prince of Peace,” indicating a ruler who would have a global and eternal reign. This points towards a more universal acceptance of his kingship, beyond just the Jewish context.

4. **Entry into Jerusalem**: The significance of Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, where He is hailed as king, is seen in the light of Zechariah 9:9, which prophesies that the king would come to Jerusalem riding on a donkey. This event is central to the narrative in the Gospels and is fulfilled as described.

5. **Final Judgment and Kingship**: In many interpretations, references to Jesus as the “King of the Jews” also tie into the eschatological expectations present in the Scriptures. Many believe that he will have a role in the final judgment, and this is echoed in passages such as Psalm 2, which talks about God’s anointed king.

While Muslims do not view Jesus as the son of God but rather as a revered prophet, the acknowledgment of His role as a significant figure within the Judeo-Christian tradition highlights the continuity of divine messages across different scriptures. In Islam, Jesus is respected, and the concept of his kingship resonates with the Islamic belief in a final significant messianic figure (the Mahdi) who will restore justice and righteousness before the Day of Judgment. 

In summary, the references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" reflect a deep connection with Old Testament prophecies concerning messianic expectations, underscoring the prophetic traditions that anticipate a divinely appointed leader.
