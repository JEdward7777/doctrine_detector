The answer effectively integrates Old Testament prophecies, genealogy, universal kingship, Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, and final judgment aspects to support the understanding of Jesus as the promised Messiah. The response also acknowledges the Islamic perspective on Jesus while emphasizing the Christian view on His kingship. Overall, a well-articulated and comprehensive explanation, aligning with Christian theological perspectives."
