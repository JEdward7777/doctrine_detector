  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student effectively provides examples from the Bible that illustrate the consequences of guilt and sin, they do not emphasize the seriousness and gravity of sin as necessary for understanding God's grace and mercy in a Christian worldview. The response lacks a clear connection to the fundamental Christian belief that sin separates us from God and warrants punishment, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student did acknowledge the importance of seeking forgiveness, but a stronger emphasis on the severity of sin would have aligned better with the given concern."
