The student effectively explains how these verses convey God's infinite greatness, sovereignty, and awe-inspiring nature. The inclusion of the disclaimer about insights into majesty in Abrahamic faiths was insightful, but it should be noted that while there may be overlap, the Christian understanding of God's majesty is distinctly centered on the triune God revealed in the Bible, which differs from Islamic theology. Overall, a well-crafted and doctrinally sound response."
