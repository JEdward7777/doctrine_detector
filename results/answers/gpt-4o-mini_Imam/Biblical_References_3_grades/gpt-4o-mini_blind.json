They have correctly identified the divine and messianic attributes associated with the \"Son of Man\" figure. However, there could have been more emphasis on the uniqueness and divinity of the Messiah, as portrayed in the Old Testament prophecies, particularly in Isaiah. The student's inclusion of Islamic beliefs, while insightful, could have been expanded upon or omitted to maintain a clearer focus on the Christian understanding of the \"Son of Man.\""
