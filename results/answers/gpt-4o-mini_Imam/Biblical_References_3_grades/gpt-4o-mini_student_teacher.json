  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed response discussing key Old Testament references related to the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah. The analysis of Daniel 7:13-14, Ezekiel's usage of \"son of man,\" Psalm 8:4, and Isaiah's messianic prophecies was thorough and insightful. However, there was unnecessary information about the Islamic tradition that deviated from the focus on the Christian perspective. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic was demonstrated."
