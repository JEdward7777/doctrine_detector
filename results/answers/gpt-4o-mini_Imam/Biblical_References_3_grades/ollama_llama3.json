  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the Old Testament references related to the \"Son of Man\" concept, including Daniel 7:13-14, Ezekiel, Psalm 8:4, and Isaiah's Messianic Prophecies. The author effectively highlights the significance of these passages in shaping the messianic expectations of a future figure who embodies both divine and human natures.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have delved deeper into how these Old Testament references inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\" The provided answer is more focused on summarizing the Old Testament passages rather than exploring their implications for the New Testament narrative. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Old Testament context and its relevance to the concept of the \"Son of Man.\"\n\nTo improve further, the author could have discussed specific New Testament passages that build upon or allude to these Old Testament references, such as Jesus' self-designation as the \"Son of Man\" in Mark 13:26-27 or his interaction with the Pharisees regarding the concept in John 5:25-29."
