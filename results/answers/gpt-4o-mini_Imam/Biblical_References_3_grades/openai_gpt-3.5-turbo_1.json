It offers a thorough analysis of relevant passages and their implications, highlighting the divine and human nature of the \"Son of Man\" as portrayed in the Old Testament. The connection between the prophetic identity in Ezekiel and the messianic expectations in Daniel is clearly articulated, demonstrating how these Old Testament concepts inform the understanding of Jesus as the fulfillment of the \"Son of Man\" prophecy in the New Testament. A well-rounded and insightful response overall."
