It effectively connects the prophecies in Daniel and Ezekiel to the concept of the Messiah, emphasizing the divine and human nature of Jesus. The inclusion of relevant verses from the Psalms and Isaiah further strengthens the argument. However, a deeper analysis of the implications of these Old Testament references on Jesus' identity and mission in the New Testament could enhance the response even further."
