The explanation of key passages like Daniel 7:13-14, Ezekiel, and Psalm 8:4, along with the reference to Isaiah\u2019s messianic prophecies, demonstrates a solid foundation in linking the Old Testament concepts to Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies in the New Testament. Additionally, the comparison with Islamic beliefs showing similarities in the expectation of a coming Messiah adds depth to the discussion. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern provided in a Christian-specific worldview perspective."
