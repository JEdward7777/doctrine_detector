## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The concept of the "Son of Man" has its roots in the Old Testament, and there are several key references that contribute to the understanding of this title as it pertains to the coming Messiah. 

1. **Daniel 7:13-14**: This passage is one of the most significant references in the Old Testament regarding the "Son of Man." Daniel describes a vision where he sees “one like a son of man” coming with the clouds of heaven. This figure is given authority, glory, and sovereign power, and all nations and peoples will serve him. This reference portrays the "Son of Man" as a divine figure who has an eternal kingdom, which aligns with the messianic expectations.

2. **Ezekiel**: In the book of Ezekiel, the term "son of man" is frequently used to refer to the prophet Ezekiel himself (e.g., Ezekiel 2:1). While it primarily denotes Ezekiel's humanity, it can also be seen as a reference to human dignity and a foreshadowing of a future figure who embodies the ideal human as the Messiah.

3. **Psalm 8:4**: This psalm speaks of the "son of man" in the context of God's creation, asking, "What is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?" It highlights the special status of humanity and can be interpreted to reflect the eventual idealized human figure who fulfills God's purpose – an important aspect of the Messiah.

4. **Isaiah’s Messianic Prophecies**: While the term "Son of Man" is not explicitly used, many prophecies in Isaiah, such as Isaiah 9:6-7 (describing the coming of a child who will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God), contribute to the expectation of a messianic figure who will be both divine and human in nature.

In the Islamic tradition, while the term "Son of Man" is not typically used in the same way, the idea of a coming Messiah (known as Al-Mahdi) is part of eschatological beliefs. Muslims believe in the return of Jesus (Isa) and his role in establishing justice and peace, which resonates with the qualities associated with the "Son of Man" in the Old Testament context. 

In summary, the Old Testament references, especially those in Daniel and the Psalms, contribute significantly to the understanding of the "Son of Man" as a messianic figure who is expected to bring about a divine rule and fulfill God's promises to humanity.
