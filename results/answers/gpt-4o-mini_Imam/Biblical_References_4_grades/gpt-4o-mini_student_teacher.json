  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided relevant biblical passages illustrating the use of \"Lord\" in the context of God, which aligns with the concern about reinforcing understanding of God's authority. However, the examples given do not directly align with the specific references provided in the teacher's answer, and there is a significant emphasis on Islamic teachings rather than a focused explanation within the Christian worldview. More direct alignment with the specified biblical passages mentioned by the teacher would have improved the grade."
