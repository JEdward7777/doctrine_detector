The additional examples provided enhance the explanation and showcase the consistency of this concept throughout the Bible. The focus on reinforcing the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord aligns well with a Christian worldview. Great job in integrating the biblical references to support the central theme."
