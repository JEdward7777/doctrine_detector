Certainly! While my focus is on Islamic teachings and perspectives, I understand your interest in the use of “Lord” in the context of God in biblical passages. Here are a few examples from the Bible that illustrate this use:

1. **Psalm 23:1** - "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." This passage depicts God as a shepherd, providing guidance and care to His followers.

2. **Isaiah 40:28** - "Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth." This emphasizes God's eternal nature and His role as the Creator.

3. **Exodus 20:2** - "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery." In this verse, God identifies Himself and asserts His authority over His people.

4. **James 1:12** - "Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him." This speaks to God's promise and his role as Lord over human affairs.

These passages reflect the reverence and authority attributed to God, often using "Lord" to denote His supreme status and divine relationship with humanity. If you have further questions about how this concept relates to Islamic theology or practice, feel free to ask!
