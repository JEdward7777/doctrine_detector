  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation connecting the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings, specifically highlighting its significance in the context of the Last Supper and the Jewish Passover. The references to Matthew 26:26 and 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 help support the explanation well. The student could enhance the response by delving deeper into the theological significance behind the use of unleavened bread, connecting it more explicitly to Jesus as the ultimate Passover lamb and the fulfillment of Old Testament foreshadowing. Overall, a good explanation with room for further elaboration on doctrinal connections."
