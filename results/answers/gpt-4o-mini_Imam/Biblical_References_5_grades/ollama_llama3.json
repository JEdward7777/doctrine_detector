  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical context surrounding unleavened bread, particularly in relation to the Last Supper and the Jewish Passover. It also correctly identifies 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 as a relevant passage that connects unleavened bread to Christian life and purity.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response could have delved deeper into the biblical texts and their connections. For example, it only mentions Matthew 26:26 in passing, without providing further context or explanation. Additionally, the response could have explored more explicitly how the concept of unleavened bread relates to Christian teachings on sacrifice, remembrance, and spiritual cleansing.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical context surrounding unleavened bread, but could have provided more depth and analysis in its discussion."
