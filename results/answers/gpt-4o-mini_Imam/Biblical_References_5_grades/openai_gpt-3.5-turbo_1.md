## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The concept of unleavened bread is primarily connected to the New Testament in the context of the Last Supper, which Jesus shared with his disciples before his crucifixion. In the Gospel of Matthew, for example, during the account of the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26), Jesus takes bread and breaks it, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me." This moment is significant for Christians, as they associate the bread with the sacrifice of Jesus.

Additionally, the practice of using unleavened bread is influenced by the Jewish Passover, during which unleavened bread is traditionally consumed. This ties into the broader theme of Jesus' role as the Passover lamb, which is central to Christian theology regarding redemption and sacrifice.

In the context of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 also highlights the importance of sincerity and truth, using the metaphor of leaven to discuss the idea of sin and its removal during the observance of this feast. Paul encourages the followers to "purge out the old leaven," signifying the need for spiritual purity.

These references illustrate how the concept of unleavened bread connects to Christian teachings, emphasizing themes of sacrifice, remembrance, and spiritual cleansing.
