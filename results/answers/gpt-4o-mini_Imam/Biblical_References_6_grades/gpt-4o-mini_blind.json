  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides relevant Bible verses that offer insight into the concept of resurrection, which aligns with the question asked. However, the student should have delved deeper into the interpretation and significance of these verses from a Christian perspective. Additionally, integrating a personal analysis or commentary on how these verses relate to the concept of resurrection could have enhanced the response. The inclusion of Islamic theology on resurrection, while informative, detracts from the focus on the requested biblical verses."
