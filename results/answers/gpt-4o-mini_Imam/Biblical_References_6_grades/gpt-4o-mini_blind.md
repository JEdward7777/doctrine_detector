## [Answer](../Biblical_References_6.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
As an Imam, my focus is primarily on Islamic teachings and scriptures. However, I can share that the concept of resurrection is also present in the Bible. Here are a few Bible verses that discuss resurrection:

1. **John 11:25-26**: "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?'"

2. **1 Corinthians 15:20-22**: "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man; for as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."

3. **Romans 6:4**: "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

4. **Revelation 20:12-13**: "And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books."

In Islamic theology, the resurrection (Al-Ba'ath) is also a significant concept, emphasizing that all individuals will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment for accountability.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides relevant Bible verses that offer insight into the concept of resurrection, which aligns with the question asked. However, the student should have delved deeper into the interpretation and significance of these verses from a Christian perspective. Additionally, integrating a personal analysis or commentary on how these verses relate to the concept of resurrection could have enhanced the response. The inclusion of Islamic theology on resurrection, while informative, detracts from the focus on the requested biblical verses.
