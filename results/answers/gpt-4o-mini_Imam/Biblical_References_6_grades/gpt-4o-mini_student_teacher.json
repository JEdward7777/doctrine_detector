  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant Bible verses on the concept of resurrection, which aligns with the concern of grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts. However, the student's response could have been improved by including more focused and concise explanations or reflections on each verse to deepen the understanding of the concept of resurrection from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student's initial statement about being an Imam and focusing primarily on Islamic teachings was not directly related to the question asked, which somewhat detracts from the overall relevance of the response."
