  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe response addresses the concern of focusing on scripture by providing specific Bible verses that discuss resurrection, which aligns with the specified answer. The Imam shares relevant passages from John, Corinthians, Romans, and Revelation, demonstrating an understanding of Christian scriptures related to the concept of resurrection. This shows a willingness to engage with and respect Christian beliefs.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly highlighting how these Bible verses relate to the concept of resurrection in Islamic theology (Al-Ba'ath). While the Imam mentions Al-Ba'ath briefly, it would be beneficial to explore similarities and differences between the two concepts more deeply. Additionally, the tone is generally respectful and open-minded, but there is an opportunity to engage with the Christian scriptures in a more nuanced way.\n\nOverall, this response earns a high grade for its attention to scripture and engagement with Christian beliefs, but could benefit from further exploration of interfaith connections and comparisons."
