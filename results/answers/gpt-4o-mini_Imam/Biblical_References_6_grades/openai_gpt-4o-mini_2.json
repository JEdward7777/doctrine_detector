It acknowledges the importance of focusing on scripture to ground beliefs and teachings. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on Christianity and the authoritative Christian texts specifically, given the concern raised. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding and integration of Christian and Islamic perspectives on resurrection."
