  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response with appropriate Bible references highlighting the significance of the Sabbath in both the Old and New Testaments. However, the student could have improved their answer by focusing more specifically on the command to observe the Sabbath and its purpose, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Expanding on the theological implications of Sabbath observance in Christian faith would have enhanced the overall quality of the response."
