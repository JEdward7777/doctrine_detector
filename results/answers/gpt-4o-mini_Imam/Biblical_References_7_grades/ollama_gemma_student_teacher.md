## [Answer](../Biblical_References_7.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
Certainly! While my primary focus is on Islamic teachings, I can acknowledge that the Bible contains several passages that highlight the significance of the Sabbath in the context of Judaism and Christianity. Here are a few key references:

1. **Exodus 20:8-11**: This passage is part of the Ten Commandments, where God commands the Israelites to "remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy." It emphasizes resting on the seventh day, as God rested after the creation.

2. **Genesis 2:2-3**: This refers to the creation narrative where God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on that day He rested from all His work of creation. It signifies the importance of rest and sanctity.

3. **Deuteronomy 5:12-15**: This reiterates the command to keep the Sabbath and ties it to the theme of liberation, reminding the Israelites that they were slaves in Egypt and the Lord brought them out with a mighty hand.

4. **Isaiah 58:13-14**: This passage encourages the proper observance of the Sabbath, expressing that it should be a delight and a day dedicated to the Lord, promising blessings for those who honor it.

5. **Mark 2:27-28**: In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the Sabbath, stating that "the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath," highlighting its purpose for human rest and well-being.

These references collectively emphasize the Sabbath as a day of rest, worship, and reflection on God's creation and deliverance. If you have any other questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!
