  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of key Bible verses referencing the concept of ransom and how they contribute to the understanding of redemption. They effectively highlighted the sacrificial nature of Jesus' mission and the universal scope of His ransom. However, deducting some points for including a comparison with a Muslim perspective, which deviates from the focus of exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption within a Christian worldview. Overall, a strong demonstration of understanding biblical concepts."
