  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively provides a detailed explanation of the concept of ransom in the Bible, citing key verses and explaining their significance in relation to redemption. The integration of verses like Matthew 20:28, Mark 10:45, 1 Timothy 2:5-6, Hebrews 9:12, and Revelation 5:9 demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. The comparison with a Muslim perspective is insightful, but could have been expanded further to provide a deeper analysis. Overall, the response shows a comprehensive exploration of the Christian worldview on redemption."
