  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student correctly identified relevant Bible verses that touch upon the concept of covenant faithfulness, showcasing an understanding of the subject. However, there is room for improvement in accurately aligning the context of the verses with the concern provided. Mentioning the distinct covenantal perspectives between Christianity and Islam would have strengthened the response. Additionally, while the student did well in providing verses, including more explicit examples, like Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18, would have further enhanced the answer. Overall, a solid effort with some areas for refinement."
