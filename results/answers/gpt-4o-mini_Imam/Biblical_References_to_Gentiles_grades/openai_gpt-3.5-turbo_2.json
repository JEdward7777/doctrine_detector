The explanation offered aligns well with the concern related to exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion from a Christian worldview. However, since the response comes from an Imam and is based on a general analysis from a Christian theological perspective rather than a specific Christian perspective, there could be some nuances or deeper insights that a Christian theologian might provide."
