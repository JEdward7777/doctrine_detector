The inclusion of relevant passages from Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Leviticus demonstrates a good understanding of the festival's significance in Jewish tradition. However, there is room for improvement as the student missed mentioning the relevant references in 2 Chronicles and Numbers as stated in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the inclusion of information about Pentecost in the New Testament and the connection to Christian beliefs was well done. The mention of a Muslim context, while interesting, was not directly relevant to the scriptural basis for the observance of Pentecost."
