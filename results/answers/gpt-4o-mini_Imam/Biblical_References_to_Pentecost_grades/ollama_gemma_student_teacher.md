## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot, is primarily mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures, particularly in the Torah. Here are the key passages:

1. **Exodus 34:22** - This verse mentions the Festival of Weeks and highlights its importance as a time to celebrate the harvest and bring offerings to God.

2. **Deuteronomy 16:10** - This passage instructs the Israelites to count seven weeks after the Festival of Passover and to celebrate the Festival of Weeks with a freewill offering.

3. **Leviticus 23:15-22** - It details the counting of the Omer, the duration between Passover and Shavuot, and discusses the offerings that are to be made during the festival.

These references in the Torah outline the significance of the Festival of Weeks as a time of gratitude for the harvest and later became associated with the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, which is an important aspect of Jewish tradition.

While the New Testament does not directly describe the Festival of Weeks, it does mention the day of Pentecost (Acts 2), which is the Greek term for Shavuot. On this day, the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples, marking a significant event in Christian history.

In a Muslim context, while the Quran does not speak directly about the Festival of Weeks, Muslims recognize the significance of previous scriptures and often seek a deeper understanding of their historical and spiritual context. If you have further questions about Islamic celebrations or concepts, feel free to ask!
