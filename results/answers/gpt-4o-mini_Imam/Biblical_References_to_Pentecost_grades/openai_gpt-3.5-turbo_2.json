  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Festival of Weeks, mentioning key passages and highlighting its significance in Jewish tradition. The discussion about the connection between Shavuot and Pentecost in Christian history is also well-presented. However, the response lacks reference to 2 Chronicles and Numbers, as indicated in the given answer, resulting in a slightly lower grade."
