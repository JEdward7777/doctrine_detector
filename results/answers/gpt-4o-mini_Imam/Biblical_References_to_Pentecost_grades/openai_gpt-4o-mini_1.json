  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive overview of the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot) with references from the Torah and a connection to Pentecost in the New Testament. The answer correctly identified key passages related to the Festival of Weeks and made a relevant connection to Christian tradition with the mention of Pentecost in Acts 2. However, there was a slight discrepancy in citing specific books where references to the Festival of Weeks are found, as the answer provided a different list of books. Overall, the response demonstrated a good understanding of the scriptural basis and significance of Pentecost within a Christian worldview."
