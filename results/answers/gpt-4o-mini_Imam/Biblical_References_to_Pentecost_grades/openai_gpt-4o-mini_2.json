  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70 \n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot) with relevant references from the Torah and a mention of the New Testament (Acts 2) linking the festival to Pentecost. However, there is a discrepancy between the provided answer and the actual references given in the response. The response also addresses a Muslim context tangentially but does not directly address the concern about the significance of Pentecost. Overall, the explanation is informative but lacks precision and depth in addressing the specific concern raised."
