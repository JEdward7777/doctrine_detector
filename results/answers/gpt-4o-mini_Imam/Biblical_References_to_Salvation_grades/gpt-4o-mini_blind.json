The response could benefit from a more in-depth explanation of how these passages reveal Christ's unique role in salvation, emphasizing concepts such as atonement, grace, and faith in Him as essential for redemption. Additionally, while it is informative to provide insights from an Islamic viewpoint, the focus should have been on presenting a thorough Christian understanding of Christ as Savior as requested in the question."
