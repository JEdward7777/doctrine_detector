However, the response could have delved deeper into the specific scriptural references provided (1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20) to strengthen the argument and tie it more directly to the belief in Jesus as Savior within Christian theology. Additionally, while the explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus is informative, it slightly detracts from the focus on the Christian view in this context."
