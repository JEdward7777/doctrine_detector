  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a great job of highlighting various scriptures that emphasize Jesus' role as the cornerstone, providing context and explanations for each passage. The writer also effectively weaves together the different verses to convey the significance of Jesus' rejection and ultimate importance in the faith. The summary is concise and accurately reflects the main points made throughout the response.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response does not explicitly encourage believers to explore scripture as requested by the concern. While the writer provides scriptural references, they do not explicitly urge readers to delve deeper into the Bible or explore its depths, which could be an important aspect of deepening one's understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively communicates the biblical concept of Jesus as the cornerstone and demonstrates a good understanding of scripture."
