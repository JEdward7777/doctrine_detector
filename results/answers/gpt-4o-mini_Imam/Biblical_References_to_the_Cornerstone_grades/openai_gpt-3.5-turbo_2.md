## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Cornerstone.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Christian scriptures, several verses refer to Jesus as the cornerstone, highlighting His foundational role in the faith. Here are the key passages:

1. **Matthew 21:42** - Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" This quote references Psalm 118:22 and emphasizes the idea that although Jesus was rejected by many, He became the essential foundation of faith for believers.

2. **Acts 4:11** - Peter states, "Jesus is 'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.'" This verse asserts that Jesus, though initially dismissed by some leaders, is fundamental to the salvation offered to humanity.

3. **Ephesians 2:19-20** - Here, Paul writes, "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone." This passage conveys the idea that the Church is built upon Jesus’ teachings and His role in salvation.

4. **1 Peter 2:6** - Peter quotes Isaiah, saying, "For in Scripture it says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.'" This emphasizes the significance of faith in Jesus as the cornerstone for believers, offering them assurance and a strong foundation.

In summary, these verses convey that Jesus is the cornerstone of the faith—central to the structure of the Church and essential for true belief and salvation. His rejection by some highlights the paradox of His ultimate importance and the recognition of His role as foundational to the faith that Christians practice.
