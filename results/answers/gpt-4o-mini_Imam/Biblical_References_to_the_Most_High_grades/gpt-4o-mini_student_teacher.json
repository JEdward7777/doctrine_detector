However, the student could improve by focusing more directly on the significance of God's sovereignty in the selected verses and how they deepen our understanding of His divine authority. Additionally, while the comparisons with Islamic beliefs were informative, a more thorough exploration of Christian perspectives on God's sovereignty would enhance the response."
