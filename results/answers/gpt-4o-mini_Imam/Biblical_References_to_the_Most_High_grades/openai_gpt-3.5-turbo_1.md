## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Most_High.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Biblical context, the concept of God as the "Most High" is significant and is reflected in several verses. Here are a few key passages that illustrate this idea:

1. **Psalm 7:17** - "I will give thanks to the Lord according to His righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High."
   - This verse highlights God's righteousness, indicating that He is just and fair, deserving of praise and worship.

2. **Psalm God, the Most High, is identified as a powerful protector and deliverer, underscoring His sovereignty over all creation.**
   - This reflects His supreme power and authority, suggesting that there is none above Him.

3. **Daniel 4:34** - "At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored; then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever."
   - This passage emphasizes God's eternal nature and sovereignty over kingdoms and people, revealing that He is to be honored above all.

4. **Isaiah 57:15** - "For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: ‘I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit...’"
   - This verse indicates not only God's exalted position but also His intimate desire to be with those who are humble and contrite, illustrating His mercy and compassion.

5. **Luke 1:32** - "He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David."
   - In the New Testament, this reference to Jesus as the Son of the Most High underscores God's authority and the centrality of recognizing God’s supremacy in the plan of salvation.

These verses collectively convey that God is characterized by His sovereignty, righteousness, eternality, and compassion. The title "Most High" serves as a reminder of His ultimate authority and mastery over all things, as well as His closeness to the humble and contrite. While Muslims believe in the oneness and greatness of Allah, these themes are echoed in the Quranic descriptions of Allah as Al-A'la (The Most High) and Al-Wahid (The One), emphasizing similar characteristics of majesty, purity, and closeness to His creation.
