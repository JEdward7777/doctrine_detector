In the Hebrew Bible, the temple is often referred to as the "house of Yahweh" or similar terms that denote its sacred status as the dwelling place of God. Some specific references include:

1. **1 Kings 6:1**: This verse discusses the construction of the temple built by King Solomon, stating that it was built as a house for Yahweh.
  
2. **1 Kings 8:13**: Here, Solomon acknowledges the temple as a house for Yahweh during the dedication ceremony.

3. **2 Chronicles 2:5**: This verse refers to the temple being built as a house for Yahweh, emphasizing its importance.

4. **2 Chronicles 3:3**: This describes the construction of the temple and refers to it as the house of Yahweh.

5. **Psalm 27:4**: In this Psalm, David expresses his desire to dwell in the house of Yahweh.

6. **Isaiah 56:7**: This verse mentions that Godâ€™s house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.

These references highlight the concept of the temple as a sacred space where God's presence dwells, underscoring its significance in Jewish worship and belief. While these texts originate from the Hebrew Bible, in a Muslim context, we recognize the importance of these themes in relation to the broader context of God's oneness and the sanctity of places of worship.
