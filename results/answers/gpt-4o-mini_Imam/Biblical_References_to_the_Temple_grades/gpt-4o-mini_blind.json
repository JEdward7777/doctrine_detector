  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough and accurate list of scriptures that specifically reference the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" in the Hebrew Bible. The references provided support the concept of the temple as a sacred space where God's presence dwells. The inclusion of relevant verses from 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Psalms, and Isaiah demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the concluding statement regarding a Muslim context seems out of place and does not align with a Christian worldview, hence the slight deduction in grade."
