  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of scriptures that specifically reference the temple as the \"house of Yahweh,\" demonstrating a good understanding of the concept. The additional reference to a Muslim context, while acknowledging the significance of these themes, diverts slightly from the Christian-specific worldview required for this question. Overall, the answer is well-researched and informative."
