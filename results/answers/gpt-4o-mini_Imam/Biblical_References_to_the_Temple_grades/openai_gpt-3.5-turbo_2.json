  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and relevant discussion on the concept of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" based on the given answer and concern. It effectively references key scriptures from the Hebrew Bible that discuss this theme, showcasing a good understanding of the topic. However, the inclusion of verses from Psalms and Isaiah, while enriching the discussion, does slightly deviate from the initial focus on the specific phrase \"house of Yahweh.\" Overall, a strong response reflecting a solid grasp of the subject matter."
