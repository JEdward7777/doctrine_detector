The integration of various references from the Hebrew Bible effectively reinforces the concept of the temple as a sacred space where God's presence dwells. The connection to Jewish worship and belief is clearly articulated. However, the inclusion of a reference to a verse from the Quran or Islamic context was not necessary within the given framework, slightly detracting from the Christian-specific worldview focus."
