  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful analysis of the term \"woe\" in the Bible, offering multiple examples from both the Old Testament and the New Testament. They effectively connected each example to God's judgment, highlighting how \"woe\" is used to address various forms of sin and injustice. The student's answer demonstrated a solid understanding of the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture, making it an excellent response. However, their answer could have been strengthened by including more examples and referencing additional relevant verses to further support their points."
