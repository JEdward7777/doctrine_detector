# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
Certainly! The term "woe" is found throughout the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament and the New Testament, and it often indicates a warning of impending judgment or disaster. Here are a few notable examples and their implications regarding God's judgment:

1. **Isaiah 5:8-11**: "Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field, until there is no more room, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!" In this context, "woe" is pronounced against greed and social injustice. It reveals God's displeasure with the exploitation of others and the accumulation of wealth at the expense of community.

2. **Jeremiah 22:13**: "Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his upper rooms by injustice." This passage underscores God's judgment against those who use unethical means to gain power and wealth, emphasizing that such actions lead to destruction.

3. **Matthew 23:13**: "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces..." Here, Jesus uses "woe" to rebuke the religious leaders of His time for their hypocrisy and obstruction of God's truth. It illustrates that Godâ€™s judgment extends to spiritual leaders who mislead others.

4. **Luke 6:24**: "But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation." This verse shows that material wealth can lead to spiritual complacency, and those who prioritize riches over righteousness will face God's judgment.

The term "woe" serves as a serious lament or pronouncement of divine displeasure and often acts as a call to repentance. It reveals that God's judgment is not arbitrary but based on justice, righteousness, and the moral state of individuals and societies. In all these instances, the warnings serve to call people back to God, urging them to reflect on their actions and turn towards righteousness.
