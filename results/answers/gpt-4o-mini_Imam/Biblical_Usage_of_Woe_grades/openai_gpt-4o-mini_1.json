  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough examination of the term \"woe\" in biblical contexts, particularly in relation to divine judgment. The examples given from Isaiah, Jeremiah, Matthew, and Luke effectively illustrate how God's judgment is expressed through warnings of impending disaster or consequences for sinful actions. The connection between 'woe' and the seriousness of divine judgment is well-analyzed and supported with relevant scriptural references. The response could be further strengthened by discussing the concept of repentance and God's mercy alongside divine judgment, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
