  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the figurative ways 'Zion' is used in the Bible, highlighting its symbolism of God's presence, hope and restoration, community of believers, and spiritual significance. The explanation is well-structured and supported by relevant biblical contexts. However, to enhance the grade, the student could have included more specific biblical references to demonstrate a deeper understanding of each figurative use. Additionally, connecting these figurative uses back to the overarching narrative of God's plan for redemption could have strengthened the theological depth of the response."
