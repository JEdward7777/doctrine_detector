## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In biblical times, altars were constructed using various materials, depending on the cultural and historical context. Common materials included:

1. **Natural Stones**: Many altars were built from uncut stones, as commanded in the Torah (Exodus 20:25). This emphasized the natural and unadulterated aspect of worship, in particular avoidance of tools that could alter the stone.

2. **Earth**: In some instances, altars were made from earth or soil, especially for offerings that involved simplicity and humility (Exodus 20:24).

3. **Wood**: In certain contexts, wooden structures were used for altars, particularly in tabernacle settings or temporary shrines.

4. **Animal Sacrifices**: Although not a material for the altar itself, the altars were often used for the sacrifice of animals, which comprised the essence of their function.

5. **Bronze and Gold**: In more elaborate settings, especially in the Temple in Jerusalem, altars could be made from or overlaid with precious metals like bronze and gold, signifying their sanctity.

These materials highlight the significance of the altar as a sacred space for worship and sacrifices in ancient religious practices.
