  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times. They included relevant biblical references to support their points and highlighted the significance of each material in the context of worship and sacrifices. The student's answer demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, but they went into more detail than necessary, adding additional materials that were not asked for in the question. An excellent response overall."
