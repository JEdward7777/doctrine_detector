  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe student's response accurately mentions some common materials used for altars, such as packed dirt or large stones. However, they fail to provide a comprehensive overview, missing out on other important details about the cultural and historical contexts in which these materials were used.\n\nAdditionally, while the student mentions that some special altars were constructed from wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze, they do not elaborate further on this point. This lack of detail limits their response's ability to deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship.\n\nOverall, while the student's response is not entirely inaccurate, it could be improved by providing more context and depth in terms of the materials used for altars and their significance in biblical practices.\n\nComment: The student shows some awareness of the materials used for altars, but lacks a deeper understanding of their cultural and historical contexts. To improve, they should strive to provide more detail and nuance in their response."
