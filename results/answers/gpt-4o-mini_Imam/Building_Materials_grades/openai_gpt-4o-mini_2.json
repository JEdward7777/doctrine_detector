  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the materials commonly used in constructing altars in biblical times, aligning well with the concern of deepening a Christian's understanding of biblical practices. Additionally, the mention of animal sacrifices as an essential aspect of altar function further enhances the overall understanding of the significance of altars in ancient religious practices. The response could have been improved by explicitly referencing biblical verses or passages that support the use of specific materials for altars."
