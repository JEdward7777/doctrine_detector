  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer regarding personal sanctification in Islam, which is commendable. However, the answer did not address the specific concern related to emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process. From a Christian worldview, the focus is on believers sanctifying themselves to God and being holy in all aspects of life, emphasizing personal responsibility in actively pursuing sanctification. It would have been more beneficial if the student had directly addressed this concern in their response."
