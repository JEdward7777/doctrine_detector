While it mentions believers being encouraged to \"strive continuously towards self-improvement,\" this is not explicitly emphasized throughout the response.\n\nHowever, the response does acknowledge the importance of individual effort in achieving personal sanctification through actions such as avoiding sin, seeking forgiveness, and following the Sunnah. This suggests that personal responsibility plays some role in the sanctification process, even if it is not explicitly stated.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to directly address the concern by highlighting the importance of individual accountability and personal effort in achieving sanctification."
