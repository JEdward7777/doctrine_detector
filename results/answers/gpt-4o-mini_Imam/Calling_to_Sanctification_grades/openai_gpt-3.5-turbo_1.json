However, from a Christian worldview perspective, while the principles outlined in the response align with the concept of sanctification, the ultimate focus on personal sanctification in Islam differs from the Christian belief that true sanctification comes through faith in Jesus Christ. This distinction should be acknowledged for a more comprehensive evaluation."
