The focus on spiritual and ritual purity, purification of the soul, avoiding sin, seeking forgiveness, and following the Sunnah aligns well with the idea of sanctifying oneself to God. However, the response could further emphasize personal responsibility in the sanctification process by highlighting the individual's active role in seeking holiness and maintaining a close relationship with God."
