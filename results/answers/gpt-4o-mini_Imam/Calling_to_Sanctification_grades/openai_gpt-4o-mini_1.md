## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islam, believers are commanded to seek personal sanctification and purity through several principles outlined in the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). One of the key commands in this regard is found in the Quran:

**1. Spiritual and Ritual Purity:** Allah commands believers to maintain both physical and spiritual purity. This is manifested in the practice of ablution (wudu) before prayers, as mentioned in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:6), which highlights the importance of cleanliness.

**2. Tazkiyah (Purification of the Soul):** Believers are encouraged to engage in tazkiyah, which refers to the purification of the soul through righteous actions, remembrance of Allah, and the cultivation of good character. In Surah Ash-Shams (91:9-10), it states, "The one who purifies it has succeeded, and the one who corrupts it has failed."

**3. Avoiding Sin and Seeking Forgiveness:** Believers are urged to avoid sin and seek forgiveness for their shortcomings. Allah promises forgiveness to those who repent sincerely, as mentioned in Surah Al-Furqan (25:70): "Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good..."

**4. Following the Sunnah:** The teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) serve as a guide for believers in their quest for personal sanctification. Following his example in morality, worship, and conduct helps to cultivate a pure heart and righteous character.

In summary, personal sanctification in Islam involves a holistic approach that includes physical cleanliness, spiritual growth, ethical conduct, repentance, and adherence to the Sunnah. Believers are encouraged to strive continuously towards self-improvement and closeness to Allah.
