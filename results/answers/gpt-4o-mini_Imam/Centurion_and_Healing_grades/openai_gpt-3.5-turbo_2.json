  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus in the context of faith and authority. The student effectively connects Islamic teachings with the Christian narrative, highlighting common themes such as faith, humility, and the inclusivity of God's mercy. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the nature of faith and authority within Jesus' ministry, albeit from a perspective grounded in an Islamic context. A minor deduction is made due to the need for a more explicit emphasis on Jesus' divinity and the unique Christian understanding of His authority."
