The response focuses more on comparing the event to Islamic teachings rather than emphasizing the unique Christian perspective of universal salvation through Christ for all nations. There is a lack of depth in connecting the event to the core Christian belief in spreading the Gospel to all peoples and embracing inclusivity through God's love. The response could have further highlighted how this event exemplifies the Church's mission and the Gospel's inclusivity within the Christian faith."
