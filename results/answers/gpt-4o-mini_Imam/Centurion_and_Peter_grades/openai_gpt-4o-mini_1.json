However, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives, while informative, may detract from a purely Christian interpretation of the event and its implications within the context of the Christian faith. The focus should have been more on the mission of the Church to reach all nations and the inclusivity of the Gospel specifically from a Christian worldview."
