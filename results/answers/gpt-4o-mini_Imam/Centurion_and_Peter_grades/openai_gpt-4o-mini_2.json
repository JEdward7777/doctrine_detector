However, the perspective provided primarily focuses on Islamic teachings and interpretations rather than delving deeply into the Christian specific worldview of the mission of the Church to reach all nations and the inclusivity of the Gospel. The inclusion of more Christian theological insights and scriptural references would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
