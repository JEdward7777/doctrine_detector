The information is accurate and well-explained within the context of the time. However, the answer could be enhanced by emphasizing the spiritual significance and biblical foundations of the roles of chief priests and ordinary priests. Connecting these roles to the Old Testament scriptures and the sacrificial system ordained by God would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
