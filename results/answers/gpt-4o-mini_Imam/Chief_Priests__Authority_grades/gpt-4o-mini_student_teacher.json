  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the relationship between chief priests and ordinary priests in the Jewish religious hierarchy during the early Islamic period. They correctly highlighted the hierarchical structure where the chief priests held higher authority than ordinary priests. The inclusion of specific responsibilities and roles of each group demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. However, deducting some points for unnecessary information about the broader political landscape and collaboration with the Roman Empire, as it was not directly related to the authority relationship between the chief and ordinary priests."
