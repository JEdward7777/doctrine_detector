# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Jewish religious hierarchy during the time of the early Islamic period and earlier, chief priests and ordinary priests had distinct roles within the temple system that carried different levels of authority.

1. **Chief Priests**: The chief priests, often referred to as the high priests, held the highest authority among the priests. They were responsible for overseeing the temple rituals, maintaining the sanctity of the temple, and serving as leaders within the religious community. The high priest was often seen as a mediator between God and the people, and he performed the most important sacrifices and rituals, particularly on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement). Additionally, the chief priests often held significant influence within the broader political landscape, collaborating with ruling authorities, such as the Roman Empire during its occupation of Judea.

2. **Ordinary Priests**: Ordinary priests, who belonged to the priestly family of Aaron, fulfilled various duties within the temple. These included performing sacrifices, maintaining the temple, and assisting in various religious ceremonies. While they had authority in their roles, it was subordinate to that of the chief priests. Ordinary priests were responsible for carrying out the directives given by the chief priests and were key to the functioning of temple operations.

The relationship can be understood as hierarchical, with the chief priests providing leadership and authoritative direction, while the ordinary priests executed the practical aspects of temple worship and religious life. This structure helped maintain order and adherence to religious laws within the Jewish community and facilitated the carrying out of intricate rituals that were central to their faith.
