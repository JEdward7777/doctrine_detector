The answer is well-supported with relevant details and demonstrates a clear understanding of the religious leadership structure during that time. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the distinction in rank and authority between chief priests and ordinary priests, with a specific emphasis on the high priest's significant role. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the priestly family of Aaron, which provides additional context to the roles of ordinary priests. Overall, an excellent response from a Christian worldview perspective."
