  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful response discussing the Islamic perspective on being servants of Allah. However, the answer did not directly address the Christian understanding of being called 'children of God' and how it impacts the relationship between believers and God. The response also did not address the concern about deepening one\u2019s faith and sense of belonging in the Christian community specifically. Therefore, the grade is lower as the answer did not align well with the question and concern provided."
