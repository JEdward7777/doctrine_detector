  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of what a 'clear conscience' means in the context of Christian teachings, touching on aspects like inner peace, moral clarity, aligning with God's will, and seeking forgiveness when falling short. However, the student veered off course by including a perspective from Islam, which is not aligned with the Christian worldview requested in the question. It is important to maintain a clear focus on the Christian teachings when responding to questions from that specific perspective."
