  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful analysis of the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22, drawing parallels with Islamic thought on mercy and redemption. However, the response lacked a clear focus on balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment, which was the specified concern. The student could have delved deeper into how these teachings reconcile justice and mercy in the context of punishment as a form of condemnation."
