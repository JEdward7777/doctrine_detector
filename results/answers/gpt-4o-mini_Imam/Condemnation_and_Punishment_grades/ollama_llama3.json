  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of exploring the teachings of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22, drawing out key insights about mercy, compassion, and the role of punishment in the context of condemnation. The author's ability to connect these biblical verses to broader Islamic teachings on mercy (*rahmah*) and redemption is particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe response also effectively addresses the concern about balancing divine justice and mercy, highlighting how both Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 encourage a mindset that prioritizes understanding, compassion, and forgiveness over harsh judgment and condemnation. The conclusion nicely summarizes the main points and reiterates the importance of fostering a mindset that leans heavily on mercy, compassion, and redemption.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are minor, such as some repetition in the introduction and a few instances where the language could be more concise. Overall, however, this is a strong response that thoughtfully engages with the biblical teachings and broader Islamic concepts to explore the complex issue of balancing divine justice and mercy."
