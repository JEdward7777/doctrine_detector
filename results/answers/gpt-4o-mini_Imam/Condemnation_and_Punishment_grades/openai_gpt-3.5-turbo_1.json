However, there is a concern that the answer provided does not fully address the balance between divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. While the response acknowledges the importance of mercy, compassion, and redemption, it would have been stronger if it had delved deeper into how divine justice intersects with these concepts in the context of punishment. Further exploration of how God's justice is expressed alongside His mercy would have enhanced the overall analysis."
