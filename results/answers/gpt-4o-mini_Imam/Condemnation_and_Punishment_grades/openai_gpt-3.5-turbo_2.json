However, the concern raised about balancing divine justice with mercy in understanding punishment is not effectively addressed. The response primarily focuses on the importance of mercy and redemption without delving deeply into the concept of divine justice in punishment. It would have been beneficial to explore how divine justice can coexist with mercy and redemption in the context of punishment, providing a more comprehensive Christian perspective."
