The connection to Islamic thought is well-drawn, but the focus on Islam may detract somewhat from a Christian-specific worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the importance of balancing divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment, but could benefit from more explicit references to Christian beliefs on these concepts."
