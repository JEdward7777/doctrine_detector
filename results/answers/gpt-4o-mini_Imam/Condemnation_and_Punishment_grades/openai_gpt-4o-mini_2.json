However, the response did not address the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy adequately. While it emphasizes the importance of mercy and redemption, it lacks sufficient discussion on the role of divine justice in understanding punishment. A more balanced approach that delves deeper into reconciling divine justice with mercy would enhance the overall response."
