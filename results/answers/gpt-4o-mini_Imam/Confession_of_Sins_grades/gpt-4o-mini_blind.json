The emphasis on prayer, scripture, fellowship, avoiding triggers, and remembering God's promises aligns well with Christian teachings. However, the response could have been strengthened by including specific Bible verses that directly address the issue of temptation and sin. Additionally, mentioning the importance of relying on the power of the Holy Spirit for strength could have enhanced the completeness of the answer."
