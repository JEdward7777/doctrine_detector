  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded response with insights that align with general principles found in Christianity and other Abrahamic faiths. However, the student did not emphasize the importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness, which was a key concern in the reference answer provided by the teacher. In a Christian worldview, the act of confessing sins and seeking God's forgiveness is paramount in overcoming temptation. The student's response could have been stronger if it explicitly highlighted this aspect from a Christian perspective."
