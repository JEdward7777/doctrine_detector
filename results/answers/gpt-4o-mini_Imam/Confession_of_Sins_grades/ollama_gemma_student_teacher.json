  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of biblical principles for overcoming temptation from a Christian perspective. It addresses the concern about acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning the importance of confessing sins as a Christian response to temptation. The reference answer emphasizes this crucial step, which is not explicitly addressed in the student's response. Otherwise, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of relevant biblical passages and concepts."
