It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the essential step of acknowledging personal sin in seeking God's forgiveness and help in resisting sin. The inclusion of key points such as prayer, scripture, fellowship, avoiding triggers, and remembering God's promises aligns well with Christian teachings on overcoming temptation. The only area for improvement would be to further elaborate on how confession and seeking forgiveness play a transformative role in the Christian's relationship with God and the process of sanctification."
