The connections made between their consecration and their roles in God's plan are insightful. However, it would strengthen the response if it also included examples like the prophets Elijah and Elisha, who were clearly set apart for God's service and performed miraculous works in His name. Additionally, a more direct tie-in to the concept of consecration as a dedicated setting apart for divine purposes would enhance the overall depth of the answer."
