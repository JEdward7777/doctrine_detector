  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 70. \n\nWhile the student has provided a detailed explanation of how consecration prepares individuals or things for divine service in Islam, there are doctrinal issues from a Christian perspective. The fundamental differences between Islamic beliefs and Christian beliefs regarding consecration and service to God need to be addressed for a higher grade. The answer correctly discusses concepts such as intention, purification, commitment to faith, and connection to the divine, but the theological framework is not aligned with a Christian worldview. The student should incorporate Christian beliefs and practices related to consecration and service to God to improve the grade."
