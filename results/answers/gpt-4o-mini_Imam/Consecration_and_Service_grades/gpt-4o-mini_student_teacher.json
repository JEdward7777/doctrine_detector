  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of how consecration is viewed within Islam and how it prepares individuals or things for divine service, the response did not adequately address the concern of understanding the purification process that comes with consecration. The student did touch on purification in their response, mentioning physical and spiritual purification, but did not delve deeply into this aspect as much as the reference answer did. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of consecration in Islam, but fell short on emphasizing the purification aspect specifically."
