While it doesn't directly address the concern about understanding the purification process that comes with consecration, it does mention purification as one of the key steps in the consecration process (point 2). The response also provides a clear explanation of what consecration means in Islamic context, which aligns well with the given answer. However, to better address the concern and provide a more detailed understanding of the purification process, some additional information could be added to strengthen the response."
