It is important to delve deeper into specific biblical verses and theological teachings to provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the Christian perspective on evil and its consequences. Additionally, the response could have emphasized the need for repentance, the atonement through Christ, and the ultimate judgment based on one's actions, in line with Christian beliefs."
