  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer highlighting key biblical passages on pride and humility, as well as offering examples from Scripture to support their points. However, the student's answer could have delved deeper into the emphasized contrast between pride and humility as outlined in the reference answer given by the teacher. Focusing more on the spiritual implications of these virtues would have strengthened the response."
