The examples from scripture further enhance the understanding of these concepts. However, the ending statement mentioning Muslims seems somewhat out of context in a Christian worldview-focused evaluation. It would have been more appropriate to further elaborate on how these biblical teachings can impact one's spiritual life in the context of pride and humility."
