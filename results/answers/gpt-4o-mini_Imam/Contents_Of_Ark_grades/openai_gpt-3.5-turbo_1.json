However, it lacks depth in relating these items to the significance of God's covenant with the Israelites as portrayed in the Bible, particularly in terms of His provision and priestly leadership. The Christian worldview emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and His people, and understanding the deeper symbolic meanings would enrich the response further."
