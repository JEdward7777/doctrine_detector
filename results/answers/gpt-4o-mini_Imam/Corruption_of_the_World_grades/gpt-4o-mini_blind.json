The response lacks doctrinal references or principles unique to Christianity, and instead, emphasizes more universal ethical considerations. It is important for a Christian audience to have clear guidance grounded in Christian doctrine and Scripture when discussing such topics. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to include references to the teachings of Jesus and the Apostle Paul on discerning and confronting corrupt influences in the world. The focus on interfaith perspectives may dilute the distinct Christian perspective that the question called for."
