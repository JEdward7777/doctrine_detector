  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible. The examples given are doctrinally sound and supported by relevant biblical references. The distinction between conditional and unconditional covenants is well articulated. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on the unconditional nature of the covenants to emphasize the sovereignty and faithfulness of God in fulfilling His promises regardless of human actions. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
