  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer with clear examples of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible. They have demonstrated an understanding of God's promises and expectations in covenants, citing relevant biblical references. However, there could be a slight improvement in emphasizing the dynamics of obedience and faithfulness in conditional covenants, aligning more closely with the teacher's focus on obedience as a key factor in conditional covenants."
