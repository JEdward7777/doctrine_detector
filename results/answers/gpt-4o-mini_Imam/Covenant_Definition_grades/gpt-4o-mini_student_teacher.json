  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the nature of biblical covenants, showing a good understanding of the topic. The answer effectively incorporates key features of biblical covenants and provides relevant examples. However, the student's response could have been improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern of defining a biblical covenant based on the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, there is a minor deviation in the interpretation of the biblical definition of a covenant compared to the teacher's reference answer, which slightly impacts the grade."
