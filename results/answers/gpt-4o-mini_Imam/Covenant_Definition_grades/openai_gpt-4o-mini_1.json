The incorporation of relevant biblical examples and the connection to the concept of the New Covenant through Jesus Christ further enriches the explanation. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps include a brief mention of how covenants are central to the overarching narrative of redemption and salvation in the Bible."
