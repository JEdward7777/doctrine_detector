The incorporation of core Islamic values such as mercy, forgiveness, guidance, and community solidarity further strengthens the response. However, the discussion could have been enhanced by directly addressing the concern regarding the continuity of God's promises and the overarching narrative of redemption in the Bible. Doing so would have provided a more comprehensive analysis of the topic."
