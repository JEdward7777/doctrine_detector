The response lacked a clear linkage between the concept of curses and God's judgment as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, the Islamic perspective dominated the discussion rather than emphasizing the Christian worldview and the seriousness of disobedience to God's commands highlighted in Galatians 3:10. More integration of the Christian perspective and a direct application to the concern provided would have strengthened the answer."
