It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the symbolism of the serpent in relation to temptation, disobedience, redemption, and the ongoing struggle against evil. The connection to Christ as the fulfillment of redemption in Christianity is acknowledged and compared to the concept of redemption through repentance in Islam. The response could have further emphasized the unique Christian belief in Christ as the ultimate redeemer, grounding the discussion more firmly in a Christian specific worldview."
