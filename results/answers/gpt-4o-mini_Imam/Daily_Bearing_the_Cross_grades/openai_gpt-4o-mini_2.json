The connection between following Jesus and following the Prophet Muhammad is well articulated. However, the response could have benefited from a clearer emphasis on the unique and central role of Jesus in Christianity as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins and the need for personal salvation through faith in Him. This aspect is crucial in a Christian worldview when discussing the call to discipleship and personal cost of following Christ."
