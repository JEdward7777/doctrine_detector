  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer regarding the significance of the 'day of the Lord' in the New Testament, discussing key themes such as judgment, restoration, and the need for believers to be vigilant. However, the student's response goes beyond the specific concern by including a comparison with Islamic beliefs on the day of judgment. While this broader perspective adds depth to the discussion, it somewhat deviates from the focus on the Christian worldview in relation to the given concern. Hence, a lower grade is assigned to reflect the slight departure from the Christian-specific context."
