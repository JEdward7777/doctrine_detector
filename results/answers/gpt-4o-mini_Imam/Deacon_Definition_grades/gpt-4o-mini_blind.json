  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the absence of the role of a deacon in Islam and how roles are structured within Islamic communities. However, the answer strays off track by focusing primarily on Islamic practices rather than fully addressing the role of a deacon in a Christian context. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on describing the primary role of a deacon within the local church and how it aligns with Christian teachings and principles."
