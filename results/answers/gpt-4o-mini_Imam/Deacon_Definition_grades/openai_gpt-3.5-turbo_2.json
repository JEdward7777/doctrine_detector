However, the response does not directly address the concern regarding the biblical role of servanthood in the church as exemplified by deacons. While it acknowledges the service aspect, it lacks a connection to the biblical foundation of servanthood within the Christian context. A stronger integration of biblical principles would have enhanced the response."
