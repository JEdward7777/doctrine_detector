However, it could have further connected this role of servanthood to the biblical foundation of deacons being called to serve and support the church body in a Christ-like manner. The response also effectively addresses the concern by comparing the role of a deacon in Christianity to the roles within Islamic communities, highlighting the distinct emphasis on community service in Islam."
