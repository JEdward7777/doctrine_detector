## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Christian context, the term 'adultery' is primarily understood as a violation of the marital covenant, involving sexual relations between a married person and someone who is not their spouse. This definition is grounded in various passages of the Bible, particularly in the Old and New Testaments.

1. **Old Testament**: One of the most notable references to adultery is found in the Ten Commandments. Exodus 20:14 states, "You shall not commit adultery." This commandment emphasizes the sanctity of marriage and the moral expectation of fidelity.

2. **New Testament**: Jesus addressed the issue of adultery in several passages. In the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:27-28), He expanded the understanding of adultery beyond just the physical act, stating that thinking lustfully about someone who is not one's spouse is also considered adultery. This teaching underscores the idea that adultery begins in the heart and mind, not just in physical actions.

3. **Other References**: In Matthew 19:9, Jesus speaks about the grounds for divorce, stating that sexual immorality (which includes adultery) is a valid reason for divorce. The Apostle Paul also speaks on matters of sexual ethics in his letters, reinforcing the importance of marital fidelity.

Overall, in the Christian context, adultery is seen as a serious sin that disrupts the sacredness of marriage and the trust between spouses, reflecting broader themes of faithfulness and commitment in the relationship.
