  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the term 'adultery' in the Christian context according to Scripture. They have correctly referenced key passages in both the Old and New Testaments that address adultery and have explained the broader implications of this sin on marriage and faithfulness. The inclusion of Jesus' teachings on adultery being not just a physical act but also a matter of the heart is a strong point in their answer. This response shows a good understanding of Christian beliefs regarding adultery."
