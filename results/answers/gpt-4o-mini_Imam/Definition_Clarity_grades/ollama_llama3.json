  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of providing specific biblical references to support its understanding of adultery, covering both Old and New Testament passages. It also effectively highlights the expanded definition of adultery in Jesus' teaching, emphasizing that it begins in the heart and mind rather than just physical actions.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more detailed in exploring the implications of adultery beyond its biblical definition. While it touches on the disruption to marriage and trust between spouses, further elaboration on the consequences of this sin would strengthen the overall discussion.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical definition and implications of adultery, making it a solid grade of 85."
