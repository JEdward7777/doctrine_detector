  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and detailed response, discussing various alternative translations for the term \"intercede\" in Scripture and explaining each alternative well. The student also accurately highlighted the significance of intercession in prayer and the act of advocating for others. Additionally, their answer demonstrated an understanding of the concept of intercession within a scriptural context. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a few more examples of specific biblical passages that demonstrate the concept of intercession using the alternative translations provided.\n\nOverall, the student's answer shows a strong grasp of the topic and effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the meaning and application of intercession in different contexts."
