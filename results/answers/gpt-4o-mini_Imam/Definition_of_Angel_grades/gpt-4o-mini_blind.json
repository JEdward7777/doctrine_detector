  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The answer provided a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on angels, which is informative. However, the response did not address the question directly, which asked for the biblical definition of angels and their primary role. The focus on the Islamic interpretation, while interesting, deviated from the specific request for information based on a Christian-specific worldview. To improve the grade, the student should focus on addressing the question from the perspective of biblical teachings."
