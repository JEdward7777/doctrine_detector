## [Answer](../Definition_of_Angel.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In a Muslim context, while we honor and respect the figures and teachings in the Bible, we interpret the concept of angels primarily through Islamic teachings.

In Islam, angels (known as "mala'ika") are considered beings created by Allah from light. They are non-physical entities, which means they do not possess free will like humans do. Their primary role is to serve Allah and carry out His commands. Some of the notable functions of angels include delivering messages to prophets, recording human deeds, and assisting in the governance of the universe. 

For instance, the angel Gabriel (Jibril in Arabic) is known as the messenger who brought revelations to prophets, including the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Another important angel is Malik, the guardian of Hell, while the angels known as Kiraman Katibin are responsible for recording the deeds of every person.

Thus, while the biblical definition of angels may emphasize their role as messengers and servants of God as well, in Islam, angels hold a broader significance as essential beings in the execution of Allah's will across creation.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on angels but does not directly address the biblical definition and primary role of angels as per the Christian worldview. While it is insightful to discuss the Islamic understanding of angels, the focus should have been on the specific biblical definition and role of angels, as requested in the question. The response could have been improved by incorporating biblical references and highlighting the distinctions between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on angels.
