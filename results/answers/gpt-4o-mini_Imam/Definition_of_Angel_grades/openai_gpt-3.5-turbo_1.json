However, while it emphasizes the importance of angels in carrying out Allah's commands, it does not explicitly address how this understanding can deepen faith and provide assurance of divine protection and guidance. More emphasis on the significance of angels in strengthening faith and acknowledging God's providence would have enhanced the response from a Christian viewpoint."
