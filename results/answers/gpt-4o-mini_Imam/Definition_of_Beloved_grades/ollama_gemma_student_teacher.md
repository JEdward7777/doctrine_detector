It reflects the unconditional love of God towards His followers.

4. **Christ as Beloved**: Jesus Himself is referred to as the 'beloved Son' (Matthew 3:17) during His baptism, signifying divine approval and love. This establishes the importance of Jesus as central to the understanding of Godâ€™s love.
