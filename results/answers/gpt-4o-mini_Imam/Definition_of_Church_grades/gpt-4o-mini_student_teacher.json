  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament, highlighting its significance as a community of believers rather than just a physical building. They also discussed key biblical concepts related to the church, such as the Body of Christ, the Temple of the Holy Spirit, and the mission of evangelism. However, the student included a paragraph at the end that deviates from the Christian perspective and introduces elements of Islamic beliefs, which was not relevant to the given question and concern. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of maintaining a focused Christian worldview in the response."
