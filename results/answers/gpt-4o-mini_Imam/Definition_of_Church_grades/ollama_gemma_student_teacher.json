  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the term \"church\" in the New Testament. It provides a comprehensive definition that encompasses both the local congregations and the universal body of believers. The inclusion of notable aspects such as the body of Christ, the temple of the Holy Spirit, and mission and evangelism showcases a deep grasp of the church's multifaceted role in Christianity. \n\nThe student's acknowledgment of the Islamic perspective adds depth and demonstrates an awareness of the broader religious context. However, the grade could be slightly higher if the response had more directly addressed the concern about understanding the church's role beyond just a building."
