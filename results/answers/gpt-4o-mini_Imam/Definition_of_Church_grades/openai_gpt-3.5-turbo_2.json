  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament, covering both the local and universal aspects of the church and highlighting key concepts such as the Body of Christ, the Temple of the Holy Spirit, and the church's mission. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing that the church is not just a physical building but a community of believers with a shared faith and purpose. However, the inclusion of the Islamic perspective in the concluding paragraph may dilute the focus on the Christian worldview and could have been omitted in favor of further elaboration on how the church extends beyond a mere physical structure."
