The answer could have been improved by delving into the theological significance of confession in Christianity, such as the role of Jesus Christ as the mediator between God and humanity in the act of confession. Additionally, the response could have highlighted the difference in the understanding of confession between Christianity and Islam, without equating them as wholly similar concepts."
