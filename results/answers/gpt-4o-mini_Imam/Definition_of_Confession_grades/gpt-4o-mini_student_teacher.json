  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a decent explanation of confession from a broader religious perspective, linking it to the importance of honesty, accountability, and seeking forgiveness from God. However, the student's response lacks depth in specifically addressing the biblical context of confession, which was the specified concern. There is also room for improvement in directly aligning the definition provided by the teacher with the biblical concept of confession. Encouragement to further explore and emphasize the unique biblical perspective on confession would enhance the overall response."
