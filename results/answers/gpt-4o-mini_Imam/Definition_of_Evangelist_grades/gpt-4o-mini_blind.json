However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to clarify that while various figures may convey messages in different religious traditions, the specific role of an evangelist is to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the central and unique message of salvation. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to emphasize the distinctiveness of the Christian understanding of evangelism compared to other faith traditions."
