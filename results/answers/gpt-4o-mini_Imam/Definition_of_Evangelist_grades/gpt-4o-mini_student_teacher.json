  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"evangelist\" by discussing its Greek origin and its application in a Christian context. However, the student also included information about Islamic terminology, which is not directly relevant to the question about the literal meaning of the term. To improve their response, the student should focus more on explaining the Christian-specific understanding of an evangelist in sharing the gospel."
