## [Answer](../Definition_of_Evangelist.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The term "evangelist" comes from the Greek word "euangelistes," which means "bringer of good news" or "messenger of good news." In a Christian context, it typically refers to individuals who spread the message of the Gospel, specifically the teachings of Jesus Christ. In Islamic terminology, while we do not use the term "evangelist," we understand the concept of sharing God's message, as all prophets and messengers, including Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), are considered to have been sent to convey Allah's guidance and good news to humanity.
