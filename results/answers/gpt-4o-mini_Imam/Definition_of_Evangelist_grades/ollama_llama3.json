  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does accurately define the term \"evangelist\" as someone who brings or preaches good news, which aligns with the provided answer. It also provides some insight into the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel, mentioning that they typically spread the message of Jesus Christ. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more detail about the significance and importance of the evangelist's role in sharing the gospel.\n\nThe only drawback is that the response does not specifically address the concern of understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel beyond a brief mention. A higher grade would require a more comprehensive explanation of how evangelists share the good news, such as discussing their methods, responsibilities, and impact on the world."
