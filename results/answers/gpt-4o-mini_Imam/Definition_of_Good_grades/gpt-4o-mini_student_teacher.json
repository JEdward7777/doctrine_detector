  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed comparison of the concepts of 'good' and 'evil' in Christianity and Islam, their response did not directly address the concern of understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making, as per the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the student's answer focused more on similarities and theological aspects rather than a clear and concise explanation specifically within a Christian worldview. There is room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with the reference answer and addressing the specified concern."
