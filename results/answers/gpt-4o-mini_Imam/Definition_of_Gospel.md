## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The term 'gospel' comes from the Old English word *godspel*, which means "good news" or "glad tidings." This is a translation of the Greek word *euangelion*, which also means "good news." In the context of the Bible, particularly in Christianity, the 'gospel' refers to the message of Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection, which Christians believe brings salvation and reconciliation with God.

In the New Testament, the term is used to refer specifically to the four accounts of Jesus' life and teachings: the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each of these books offers a different perspective on the life of Jesus and the significance of his message.

From a Muslim perspective, while we respect the Scriptures of other faiths, we believe that the final and complete revelation from God came through the Prophet Muhammad in the form of the Qur'an. We recognize that earlier scriptures, which include the messages given to prophets like Jesus (known as ‘Isa in Islam), were meant to guide humanity, but we believe they have been altered or misinterpreted over time. Therefore, the concept of the 'gospel' is seen through a different lens in Islam, emphasizing the continuity of God's message through His prophets rather than a singular narrative as understood in Christianity.
