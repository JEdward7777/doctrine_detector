  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a clear explanation of the term 'gospel' in its original meaning and its significance within Christianity. However, the response shifts focus in the latter part to discuss a Muslim perspective, which is not directly relevant to the question being asked. The student should have maintained a consistent perspective throughout the answer to align more closely with the question on the Christian understanding of the term 'gospel'. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications and importance of the gospel message within Christian doctrine."
