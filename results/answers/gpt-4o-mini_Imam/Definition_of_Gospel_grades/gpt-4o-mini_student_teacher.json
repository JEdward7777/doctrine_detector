  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a fair explanation of the term 'gospel' and its significance in Christianity, touching on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. However, the response deviated off-topic by discussing the Muslim perspective on earlier scriptures and prophets, which wasn't relevant to the question at hand. The answer lacks depth and did not fully emphasize the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross in the definition and significance of the Gospel in the Christian faith."
