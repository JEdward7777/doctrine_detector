The explanation of divine sanctity, prophetic context, covenantal relationship, and judgment and salvation is relatively accurate. However, the answer could benefit from more specific references to biblical passages that highlight the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in the Christian context. Additionally, while drawing parallels between Christian and Islamic teachings is helpful, more focus on the Christian perspective would strengthen the response."
