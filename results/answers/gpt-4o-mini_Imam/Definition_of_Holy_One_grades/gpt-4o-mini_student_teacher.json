However, the focus on Islamic teachings and the lack of specificity to the Christian worldview dilutes the analysis of the term's significance in the context of the holiness of God and His unique role in Scripture, as indicated in the concern. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the Christian understanding of God's holiness and how it is manifested through the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible."
