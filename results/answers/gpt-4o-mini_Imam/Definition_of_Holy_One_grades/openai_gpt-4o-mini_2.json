However, the response could have delved deeper into the unique role of the Holy One in scripture, particularly emphasizing the significance of Jesus in the New Testament as the embodiment of God's holiness and redemption for humanity. Further exploration of the specific biblical passages highlighting the holiness of God and Jesus would have strengthened the connection to Christian beliefs."
