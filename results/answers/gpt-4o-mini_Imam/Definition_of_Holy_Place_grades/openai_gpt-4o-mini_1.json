It effectively connects the initial statement about the significance of the holy place with a broader understanding of sacred spaces in religious contexts. The response demonstrates a strong grasp of the design and function of God's dwelling place by comparing and contrasting the tabernacle/temple with Islamic holy sites such as the Kaaba."
