The Imam's attempt to draw parallels with Islamic teachings on Tawbah (repentance) is also appreciated. However, the response could be further strengthened by exploring the nuances of Christian repentance and its connection to spiritual growth, as requested by the concern. Additionally, while the response provides some biblical references, it would benefit from more detailed and in-depth engagement with Scripture. Overall, a good effort, but room for improvement!"
