## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the New Testament, the term 'saints' refers to individuals who are set apart for God, often indicating those who are believers in Jesus Christ. The word comes from the Greek term "hagios," meaning "holy" or "sacred." In the New Testament, it is used predominantly to describe the followers of Christ, emphasizing their spiritual status as people who have been sanctified and called to live according to God’s will.

Saints in this context are not necessarily those who have performed miracles or lived exceptionally pious lives, as might be understood in some Christian traditions today. Instead, the term encompasses all believers, collectively forming the body of Christ, and is used to denote the community of faith. They are called to pursue holiness, live righteously, and support one another within the community of faith.

For Muslims, understanding this term can offer insights into the commonalities and differences between Christian and Islamic views of sanctity and righteousness. In Islam, every believer is invited to strive towards righteousness and to be among the "mu'min," or true believers, while also acknowledging that all humans can fall short. Both traditions value the importance of community, faith, and striving towards God’s commands.
