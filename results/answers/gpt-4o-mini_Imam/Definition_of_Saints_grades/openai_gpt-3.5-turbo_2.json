It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints to differentiate between cultural and scriptural interpretations. The response could further strengthen the Christian perspective by delving into the role of saints in intercession and the communion of saints, but overall, it demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview."
