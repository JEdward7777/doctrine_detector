It effectively relates this understanding to believers in Jesus Christ and emphasizes their spiritual status and call to live according to God\u2019s will. The response also touches on the commonalities and differences between Christian and Islamic views on sanctity and righteousness. It effectively addresses the concern by distinguishing between cultural and scriptural interpretations. Great job in integrating a Christian worldview perspective into the discussion."
