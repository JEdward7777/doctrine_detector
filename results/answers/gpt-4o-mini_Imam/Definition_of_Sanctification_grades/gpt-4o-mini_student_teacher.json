  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a generally accurate and informative explanation of the concept of sanctification in the Bible, including key aspects such as God's action, personal holiness, ritual purity, and the ongoing process of sanctification. However, the answer lacked depth in explaining the process of sanctification as being intertwined with faith in Jesus Christ and transformation by the Holy Spirit. Additionally, the student's perspective as an Imam could have been leveraged to provide a unique insight or comparison with Islamic teachings on sanctification. Overall, the answer exhibits a good understanding of the topic but could have delved deeper into the Christian perspective for a higher grade."
