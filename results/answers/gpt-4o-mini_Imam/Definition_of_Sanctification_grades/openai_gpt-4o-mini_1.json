  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the biblical concept of sanctification, covering key aspects related to God's action, personal holiness, ritual purity, and the ongoing process of sanctification in Christian doctrine. The explanation is clear and aligns well with a Christian worldview. The only minor area for improvement could be to directly reference specific Bible verses related to each concept for further depth, although the response already provides a solid foundation of understanding."
