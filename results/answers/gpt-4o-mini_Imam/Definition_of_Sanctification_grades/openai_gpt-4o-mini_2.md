## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
As an Imam, my focus is primarily on Islamic teachings and perspectives; however, I can provide a general understanding of the term "sanctify" as it relates to the Bible.

In a biblical context, "sanctify" means to make something holy or to set it apart for special use, especially in relation to God. The term is derived from the Latin word "sanctificare," which means "to make holy." Throughout the Bible, sanctification can refer to several key concepts:

1. **God's Action:** It often describes the act of God setting apart people for His service. For example, in the Old Testament, the Israelites were called to be a holy nation (Exodus 19:6).

2. **Personal Holiness:** It also refers to the process of moral and spiritual cleansing of individuals. In the New Testament, believers are sanctified through faith in Jesus Christ, transforming them into a more holy state (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

3. **Ritual Purity:** In some contexts, sanctification involved rituals or laws that separated certain days or objects as holy, such as the Sabbath or specific sacrifices.

4. **Ongoing Process:** In Christian doctrine, sanctification is often viewed as an ongoing process where believers grow in holiness and become more like Christ through the Holy Spirit.

In summary, "sanctify" in the biblical context emphasizes being set apart for God's purposes and the journey toward spiritual purity and holiness.
