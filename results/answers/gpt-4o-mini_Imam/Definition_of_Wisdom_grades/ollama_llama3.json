  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the biblical concept of wisdom, covering key aspects such as reverence for God, practical application, moral integrity, understanding, and long-term perspective. The author's attempt to connect Islamic teachings with biblical wisdom is also commendable, demonstrating an effort to bridge gaps between different religious perspectives.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by more explicit connections between the biblical concept of wisdom and making decisions that align with God's will. While the author mentions \"pleasing God\" in their initial definition of wisdom, this theme is not fully developed throughout the rest of the response. Additionally, some minor points of biblical wisdom (e.g., the role of prayer or meditation) are not explored in depth.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of wisdom and its relevance to Christian decision-making. With further development and connection-making, it could be even more effective in helping readers understand how to apply biblical wisdom in their daily lives."
