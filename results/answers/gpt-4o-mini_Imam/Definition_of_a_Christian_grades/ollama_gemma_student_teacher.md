## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Christian.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In a Muslim context, we recognize that the term "Christian" refers to followers of Jesus Christ (known as Isa in Arabic), and they identify primarily with the teachings found in the New Testament of the Bible. 

The biblical definition of a Christian can be understood through several key aspects:

1. **Belief in Jesus Christ**: Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior of humanity. They affirm his crucifixion and resurrection as central tenets of their faith. This belief is articulated in verses such as John 3:16, which emphasizes faith in Jesus for eternal life.

2. **Following His Teachings**: A Christian is also one who strives to live according to the teachings of Jesus as found in the Gospels. This includes moral principles, commands, and the love of God and neighbor.

3. **Baptism and Community**: In the New Testament, particularly in Acts 11:26, the term "Christian" was used to describe the followers of Jesus in Antioch. Baptism is often seen as a rite of initiation into the Christian faith, symbolizing the acceptance of Jesus’ teachings and community membership.

4. **The Holy Spirit**: Christians believe in the Holy Spirit’s role in guiding them and empowering them to live in accordance with their faith.

From an Islamic perspective, while we respect the spiritual and moral teachings of Jesus and acknowledge the importance of the Christian faith, our understanding of God and prophets differs. Islam teaches strict monotheism (Tawhid) and recognizes Jesus as a revered prophet, not the Son of God. 

In essence, a Christian is defined within their religious framework as a believer in Jesus Christ, his resurrection, and a follower of his teachings, while we as Muslims view their beliefs through our own theological lens.
