However, the response could have more directly addressed the given concern of how understanding miracles can deepen one's faith and acknowledgment of God's power. Additionally, while the student effectively explained the Islamic perspective on miracles, they could have connected it more explicitly to the Christian concept of miracles and God's authority."
