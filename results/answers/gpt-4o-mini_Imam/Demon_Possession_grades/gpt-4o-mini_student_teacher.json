  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of demon possession from a Biblical perspective, discussing the nature of possession, Jesus' ministry in casting out demons, spiritual warfare, exorcism, and theological interpretations. The response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer. However, the student could have emphasized more the centrality of Jesus Christ in the deliverance from demon possession as the ultimate solution, which would have provided a stronger connection to the concern of the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ."
