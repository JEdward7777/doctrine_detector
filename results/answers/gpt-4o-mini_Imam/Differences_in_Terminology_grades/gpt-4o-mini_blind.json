The definitions are well articulated and demonstrate a good understanding of the nuances of each term. However, to enhance the answer further, incorporating specific biblical examples or references where these terms are used could strengthen the Christian perspective on guidance and correction. Additionally, tying the concepts back to biblical principles on counseling and discipline would have deepened the analysis. Overall, a solid explanation with room for additional theological depth."
