  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the key differences between 'exhort,' 'encourage,' and 'admonish,' demonstrating a good understanding of the nuances of each term. The student effectively incorporated examples within a spiritual context to illustrate the application of these terms. However, there was a slight deviation in the explanation of 'admonish' compared to the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's response could have been improved by aligning their definition of 'admonish' more closely with the scriptural definition of warning or correcting someone for wrong behavior. Overall, a strong effort with room for minor refinement."
