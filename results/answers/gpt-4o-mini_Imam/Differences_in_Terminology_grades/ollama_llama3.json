  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good foundation for understanding the nuances of \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" in a Christian context, but it falls short in addressing the concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. While the response does provide some examples of how Imams might use these terms in a spiritual context, it does not explicitly tie these concepts to biblical principles or verses. To earn a higher grade, the response could have incorporated more scriptural support and reflection on how these terms relate to biblical teachings about guidance, correction, and encouragement."
