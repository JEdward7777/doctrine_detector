  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the terms 'exhort,' 'encourage,' and 'admonish' in the context of offering guidance or support, taking into consideration the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of these forms of encouragement according to scripture. The explanation aligns well with Christian teachings on the importance of guiding others with love, support, correction, and urgency when necessary. A slightly higher grade could be achieved by including more explicit references to biblical examples or principles that illustrate the use of these forms of encouragement."
