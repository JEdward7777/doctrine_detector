However, there are doctrinal inaccuracies in the response. It is important to note that while there may be similarities in the roles and qualities of disciples and companions in Christianity and Islam, the theological contexts and the specific reasons for the selection of the twelve apostles by Jesus are distinctively Christian. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration of Christian beliefs regarding the apostles' unique roles in establishing the foundation of the Christian faith."
