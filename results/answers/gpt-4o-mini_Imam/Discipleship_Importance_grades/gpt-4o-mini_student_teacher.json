  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and insightful comparison between the selection of the twelve apostles in Christianity and the companions of Prophet Muhammad in Islam. While the response shows a good understanding of the importance of disciples in both traditions, it slightly deviates from the Christian-specific focus of the question. The answer lacks a direct acknowledgment of the central role of spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church as stated in the reference answer. Therefore, the grade reflects the need for a more direct connection to the Christian perspective on the apostles' role and significance."
