  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides a more comprehensive explanation than the original answer, demonstrating an understanding of the significance of the apostles in the New Testament. The discussion highlights the themes of divine selection, leadership and guidance, diversity of representation, commitment and sacrifice, and witnessing to miracles and teachings, which are all relevant to the concern about understanding the role and significance of the apostles.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific biblical references to support its claims and by exploring the theological implications of the apostles' roles in a deeper way. Additionally, while the response does make some interesting connections with Islamic perspectives, these are not fully developed or integrated into the main argument.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the apostles' role and significance in the New Testament, but could be further strengthened by more detailed biblical analysis and theological reflection."
