## [Answer](../Division_of_Israel.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
After King Solomon's reign, which ended around 931 BCE, a significant event in Israel's history was the division of the united kingdom of Israel into two separate kingdoms: the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. 

This division occurred due to political and social tensions, particularly following Solomon's death. His son, Rehoboam, succeeded him but faced opposition from the northern tribes who sought relief from heavy taxation and forced labor policies instituted during Solomon's reign. When Rehoboam refused to lighten these burdens, ten northern tribes broke away and established the kingdom of Israel, with Jeroboam as their king, while Rehoboam ruled over the southern kingdom of Judah.

This split led to distinct political, religious, and cultural developments in both kingdoms, with Israel being influenced more by surrounding cultures and often falling into idolatry, while Judah retained a more direct connection to the Temple in Jerusalem and the Davidic lineage. The division ultimately set the stage for various prophetic missions, conflicts, and eventual conquests, including the Assyrian conquest of Israel in 722 BCE and the Babylonian exile of Judah in 586 BCE.
