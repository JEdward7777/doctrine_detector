  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of humanity's role in having dominion over the earth, they captured the essence of stewardship, Imago Dei, collaboration with God, and community and relationships well. The student effectively tied these concepts back to the biblical text, particularly Genesis 1:26-28.\n\nThe student's response demonstrated a strong understanding of the importance of responsible stewardship and ethical treatment of creation, aligning with Christian teachings on our God-given authority over the earth. The only room for improvement would be to ensure a more direct and concise alignment with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
