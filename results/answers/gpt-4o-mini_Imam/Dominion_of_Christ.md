## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic understanding, Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) is a revered prophet and messenger of Allah, but he is not seen as divine or as a son of God. The Bible presents various descriptions of Jesus Christ's dominion, particularly in the New Testament. Here are some key points:

1. **Kingdom of God**: Jesus often spoke of the Kingdom of God, emphasizing that it is not of this world. He preached about a spiritual kingdom characterized by righteousness, peace, and joy. This kingdom is accessible to all who believe in him.

2. **Authority over Creation**: The New Testament describes Jesus having authority over nature, illness, and even death. Miracles such as calming the storm, healing the sick, and raising the dead illustrate this dominion.

3. **Judgment**: In passages like Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus is depicted as the one who will judge the living and the dead, indicating his ultimate authority and dominion in the eschatological context.

4. **Eternal Reign**: Certain scriptures, particularly in the Book of Revelation, portray Jesus as having an eternal reign, often associated with themes of a new heaven and a new earth where he will rule.

From an Islamic perspective, while Jesus is indeed acknowledged as a significant figure with miraculous abilities, Muslims believe he is a servant and prophet of Allah, distinct from God himself, who will return before the Day of Judgment to restore justice, but he does not possess dominion in the divine sense as described in the Bible.
