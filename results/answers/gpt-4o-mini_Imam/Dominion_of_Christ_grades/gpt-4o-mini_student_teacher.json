  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of Jesus Christ's dominion as described in the Bible from an Islamic perspective, which is informative. However, the response did not directly address the given concern of recognizing the authority of Christ in all aspects of life and how this impacts our faith from a Christian worldview. The student should have focused more on emphasizing Jesus' role as prophet, priest, and king in asserting his authority over all creation in a Christian context."
