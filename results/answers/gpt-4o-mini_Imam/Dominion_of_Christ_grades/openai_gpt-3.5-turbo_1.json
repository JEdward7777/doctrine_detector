It acknowledges the key aspects of Jesus' dominion over creation and his role as judge and ruler. However, there could have been more emphasis on how recognizing the authority of Christ impacts faith and daily life for Christians, from a Christian worldview perspective. Expanding on this aspect would have strengthened the response further."
