However, the response falls short in directly addressing the concern of recognizing Christ's authority in all aspects of life and how this impacts faith. The response focuses more on describing Jesus' dominion rather than discussing its implications for one's faith and daily living. A stronger connection between Jesus' authority and its practical relevance for believers would have enhanced the response."
