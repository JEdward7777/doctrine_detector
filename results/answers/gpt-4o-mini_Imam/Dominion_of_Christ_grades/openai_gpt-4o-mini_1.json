It acknowledges Jesus as having authority over creation and in the eschatological context, aligning with the Christian view of Christ's dominion. However, it falls short in explicitly connecting Jesus' dominion to how it impacts faith and recognizing the significance of his authority in all aspects of life from a Christian perspective. There is room for further elaboration on the implications of Jesus' dominion for believers in shaping their faith and daily lives."
