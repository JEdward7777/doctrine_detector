However, it falls short in addressing how recognizing the authority of Christ in all aspects of life impacts our faith. It lacks a deeper reflection on the transformative power of Christ's dominion and how it should influence our daily lives and decisions as Christians. An integration of this aspect would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
