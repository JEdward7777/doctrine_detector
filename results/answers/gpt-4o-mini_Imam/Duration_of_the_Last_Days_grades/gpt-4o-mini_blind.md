## [Answer](../Duration_of_the_Last_Days.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, we tend to focus on our own scriptures, the Quran and the Sunnah, rather than on other religious texts. However, it is known that in Christian tradition, "the last days" or "the end times" often refer to a period leading up to the return of Jesus (peace be upon him) and the final judgment. 

The Bible speaks about these times, but it does not specify an exact duration for them. Verses in the New Testament, such as Matthew 24:36, highlight that no one knows the day or hour when these events will occur, not even the angels in heaven, nor Jesus himself, but only the Father. 

From an Islamic perspective, we believe in the Day of Judgment and the signs preceding it, but the specifics of timelines and events are known only to Allah. It's advised for us to focus on our actions and faith in preparation for the hereafter, rather than trying to pinpoint dates or durations pertaining to the end times.

Grade: 60

Comment: The answer discusses the concept of "the last days" from both Islamic and Christian perspectives. However, from a Christian worldview, the response falls short in doctrinal correctness by not providing a clear interpretation of the Bible's teachings on the duration of 'the last days.' The student correctly references Matthew 24:36 regarding the unknown timing of these events, but could have emphasized more on the biblical themes of urgency, preparation, and vigilance.Additionally, the answer could have better highlighted the Christian belief in the second coming of Jesus and the final judgment as central to the concept of 'the last days.'
