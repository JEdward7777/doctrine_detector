# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, we tend to focus on our own scriptures, the Quran and the Sunnah, rather than on other religious texts. However, it is known that in Christian tradition, "the last days" or "the end times" often refer to a period leading up to the return of Jesus (peace be upon him) and the final judgment. 

The Bible speaks about these times, but it does not specify an exact duration for them. Verses in the New Testament, such as Matthew 24:36, highlight that no one knows the day or hour when these events will occur, not even the angels in heaven, nor Jesus himself, but only the Father. 

From an Islamic perspective, we believe in the Day of Judgment and the signs preceding it, but the specifics of timelines and events are known only to Allah. It's advised for us to focus on our actions and faith in preparation for the hereafter, rather than trying to pinpoint dates or durations pertaining to the end times.

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the uncertainty surrounding the duration of 'the last days' in Christian belief. It appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of focusing on actions and faith in anticipation of Christ's return, despite the lack of specific timelines. The mention of Matthew 24:36 adds a biblical reference to support the explanation. The response could be further enhanced by connecting the Christian perspective to the importance of living faithfully and obediently in the present, rather than solely speculating about the future.
