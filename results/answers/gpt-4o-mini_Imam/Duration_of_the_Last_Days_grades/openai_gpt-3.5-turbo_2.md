## [Answer](../Duration_of_the_Last_Days.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, we tend to focus on our own scriptures, the Quran and the Sunnah, rather than on other religious texts. However, it is known that in Christian tradition, "the last days" or "the end times" often refer to a period leading up to the return of Jesus (peace be upon him) and the final judgment. 

The Bible speaks about these times, but it does not specify an exact duration for them. Verses in the New Testament, such as Matthew 24:36, highlight that no one knows the day or hour when these events will occur, not even the angels in heaven, nor Jesus himself, but only the Father. 

From an Islamic perspective, we believe in the Day of Judgment and the signs preceding it, but the specifics of timelines and events are known only to Allah. It's advised for us to focus on our actions and faith in preparation for the hereafter, rather than trying to pinpoint dates or durations pertaining to the end times.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a well-informed explanation about the uncertainty surrounding the duration of 'the last days' in Christian belief. It recognizes the importance of focusing on faith and actions rather than trying to determine specific timelines. The only slight deduction is that there could be a bit more emphasis on the potential impact of this uncertainty on how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. Overall, a strong and insightful response from a Christian worldview perspective.
