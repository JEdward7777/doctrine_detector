It appropriately highlights the Biblical verse emphasizing the unknown timing of these events. The focus on the importance of faith and preparation for the hereafter aligns well with Christian teachings on living out one's faith in readiness for Christ's return. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of being steadfast in faith and righteous living regardless of the unknown timeline, which would have provided a stronger connection to the concern raised."
