## [Answer](../Duration_of_the_Last_Days.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, we tend to focus on our own scriptures, the Quran and the Sunnah, rather than on other religious texts. However, it is known that in Christian tradition, "the last days" or "the end times" often refer to a period leading up to the return of Jesus (peace be upon him) and the final judgment. 

The Bible speaks about these times, but it does not specify an exact duration for them. Verses in the New Testament, such as Matthew 24:36, highlight that no one knows the day or hour when these events will occur, not even the angels in heaven, nor Jesus himself, but only the Father. 

From an Islamic perspective, we believe in the Day of Judgment and the signs preceding it, but the specifics of timelines and events are known only to Allah. It's advised for us to focus on our actions and faith in preparation for the hereafter, rather than trying to pinpoint dates or durations pertaining to the end times.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the uncertainty surrounding the duration of 'the last days' in Christian belief. It appropriately highlights the Biblical verse emphasizing the unknown timing of these events. The focus on the importance of faith and preparation for the hereafter aligns well with Christian teachings on living out one's faith in readiness for Christ's return. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of being steadfast in faith and righteous living regardless of the unknown timeline, which would have provided a stronger connection to the concern raised.
