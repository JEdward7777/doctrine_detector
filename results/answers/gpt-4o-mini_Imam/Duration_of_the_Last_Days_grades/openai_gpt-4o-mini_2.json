It correctly references Bible verses and acknowledges the importance of focusing on faith and actions in preparation for the return of Jesus. The concern about how this uncertainty can impact Christian living is valid and the response effectively addresses the potential implications for living out one's faith in anticipation of Christ's return. Well done."
