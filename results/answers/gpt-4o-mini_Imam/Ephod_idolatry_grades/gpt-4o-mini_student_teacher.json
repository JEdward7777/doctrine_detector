  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed analysis of the story of Gideon and the creation of the golden ephod from an Islamic perspective, highlighting important lessons related to idolatry, monotheism, leadership, faith, and the consequences of misguided actions. While the student's response is well-written and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic, the concern provided focuses specifically on the importance of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith. The student's answer, although informative, did not directly address this concern with a Christian-specific worldview. It is essential to align the response more closely with the specified concern to receive a higher grade."
