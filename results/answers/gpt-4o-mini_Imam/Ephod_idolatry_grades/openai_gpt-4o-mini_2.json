The student effectively incorporates Islamic teachings on monotheism and leadership responsibilities. However, there is room for improvement in explicitly addressing the concern of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith throughout the entire response. An enhanced connection between the Islamic perspective presented and this concern would have strengthened the overall coherence of the analysis."
