  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the materials used in constructing the high priest's ephod, highlighting their symbolic significance. However, the response included additional materials like linen which were not specifically mentioned in the reference answer. The student demonstrated a deep understanding of the symbolism behind the materials, but should have focused more on directly answering the question with the materials mentioned in the reference answer."
