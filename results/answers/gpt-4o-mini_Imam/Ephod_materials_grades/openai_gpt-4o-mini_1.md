The ephod worn by the high priest, as described in the Book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible, was made from specific materials that were both luxurious and symbolic. According to Exodus 28:5-6, the ephod was crafted from:

1. **Gold**: This symbolizes purity and divinity.
2. **Blue**: This color is often associated with the heavens and the divine.
3. **Purple**: This color represents royalty and majesty.
4. **Scarlet**: This color symbolizes sacrifice and atonement.
5. **Linen**: Fine linen was used for its purity and comfort.

These materials were woven together to create a magnificent and intricately designed garment, representative of the high priest's role and his service to God and the people of Israel. The ephod included a breastplate, which held precious stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel, further emphasizing its significance in the priestly garments.
