  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the significance of the high priest's ephod in the context of Old Testament worship. They have covered various aspects such as the garment's sacredness, symbolism of authority, representation of the twelve tribes, and its role in atonement and sacrifice. However, the student could have focused more on the primary role of the ephod in mediating between God and the people, as well as the use of the Urim and Thummim for discerning God's will, which are the core aspects highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding is demonstrated."
