The points made effectively elaborate on how the ephod symbolized the priest's unique role, authority, and responsibilities, as well as its connection to divine guidance, covenant, representation of the tribes, and atonement. The response addresses the concern by clearly demonstrating how understanding the high priest's ephod contributes to a deeper comprehension of the Old Testament priesthood and worship practices."
