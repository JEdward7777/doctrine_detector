  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on the Trinity. It clearly articulates the Islamic belief in the oneness of God (Tawhid) and rejects the Christian concept of the Trinity. However, the response lacks clarity in addressing the specific concern related to the essence of God. While the student correctly explains the Islamic understanding of God as unique and indivisible, the connection between this and the essence of God as a whole remains underdeveloped."
