  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from the perspective of Islamic theology regarding the eternal consequences for those described as \"perishing.\" While the answer is informative and well-structured, it does not directly address the specified concern of understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God. From a Christian worldview, the emphasis would be on the eternal separation from God and the consequences of rejecting a relationship with Him. The student's answer could be improved by focusing more on this aspect from a Christian perspective."
