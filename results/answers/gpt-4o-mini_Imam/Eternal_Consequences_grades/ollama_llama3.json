While it does not explicitly state that those who perish will not live eternally with God in heaven, it effectively conveys the seriousness of eternal separation from God by highlighting the severe consequences of rejecting faith and failing to seek repentance.\n\nThe response also emphasizes Allah's mercy and compassion, emphasizing the importance of seeking forgiveness and turning back to Him. This aspect is crucial for understanding the gravity of the situation and encouraging readers to take heed. Overall, the response effectively conveys the seriousness of eternal separation from God, even if it does not directly address the concern in the exact wording provided."
