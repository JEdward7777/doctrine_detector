The reference to Islamic teachings on accountability, regret, and the lack of opportunity for repentance adds depth to the discussion of this serious consequence. However, the response could further highlight the significance of eternal separation from God in terms of the ultimate loss of His presence, love, and grace, which are foundational aspects of a Christian worldview."
