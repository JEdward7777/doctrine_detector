However, from a Christian worldview, there is a concern about the response not addressing the theological significance of Jesus as the eternal Son of God, involved in creation. The emphasis on the eternal existence and preeminence of Jesus as the Son of God is a central Christian belief and should have been directly engaged with in the response to better address the concern provided."
