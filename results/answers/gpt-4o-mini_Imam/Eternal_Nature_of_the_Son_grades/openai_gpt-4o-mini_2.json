However, from a Christian worldview which emphasizes the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God, the discussion is not in alignment with that perspective. Jesus, as the Son of God, is believed to have always existed and played a role in creation, which is a central tenet of Christian belief. The response did not address this concern and instead focused solely on contrasting the Islamic understanding with human sons."
