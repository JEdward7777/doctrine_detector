  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provides a comprehensive explanation from an Islamic perspective about the concept of eternal punishment in hell, the answer does not align with the teacher's reference answer which is based on a Christian worldview. The student's response lacks a direct reference to Jesus' sacrifice as the basis for salvation and eternal consequences. It is important to ensure that the answer is framed within the specific Christian beliefs and understanding of justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences."
