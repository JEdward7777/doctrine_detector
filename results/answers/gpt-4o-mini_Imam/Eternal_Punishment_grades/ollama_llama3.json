Instead, it presents a nuanced discussion of Islamic theology's views on eternal punishment, accountability, the severity of sin, and God's mercy.\n\nThe response highlights the importance of understanding God's justice in Islam, emphasizing that His attributes are central to the faith. It also discusses the concept of hell as a reminder for believers to turn back to God and seek forgiveness, which aligns with the concern about divine justice and mercy.\n\nWhile the response does not directly address the original answer, it provides a thoughtful and well-reasoned exploration of the Islamic perspective on eternal punishment. The discussion is engaging and informative, making it an excellent response in terms of content and presentation. However, since it does not explicitly address the original answer, it does not fully align with the concern.\n\nTo improve this response, consider incorporating more direct references to Jesus' sacrifice and how they relate to Islamic theology's views on eternal punishment. Additionally, providing more explicit connections between the Islamic perspective and the Christian concept of hell as a consequence of rejecting Jesus' sacrifice would strengthen the response's relevance to the original answer and concern."
