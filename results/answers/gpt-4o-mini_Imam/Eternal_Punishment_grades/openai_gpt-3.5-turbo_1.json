  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice within an Islamic theological framework. The points raised regarding divine justice, accountability, severity of sin, the mercy of God, reminder for believers, and the balance with eternal reward are all well-developed and address the concern raised regarding the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. The only reason for slight deduction is the deviation from a solely Christian perspective, as the response focuses on Islamic beliefs rather than directly addressing the concern from a Christian worldview. Nonetheless, the reasoning and analysis provided in the response are sound and demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic."
