The points made about divine justice, accountability, severity of sin, the mercy of God, the reminder for believers, and the balance with eternal reward all contribute to a strong argument. However, the response should have directly addressed the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences raised with the provided answer. Engaging more directly with the specific concern would have strengthened the response even further."
