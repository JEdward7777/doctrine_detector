  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful analysis of the significance of the encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch in the context of the early church. However, the response focused more on drawing parallels with Islamic beliefs rather than addressing the concern of inclusiveness within the Christian message. The student did not fully emphasize the importance of the extension of the Gospel beyond cultural boundaries and the acceptance of people from diverse backgrounds within the early church. The answer lacked a clear Christian-specific worldview in addressing the concern provided."
