The response seems to downplay the uniqueness of Christianity in its universal message and fails to emphasize the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus Christ. It is important to approach such comparisons from a Christian worldview that upholds the distinctiveness of Christian teachings and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ for all people."
