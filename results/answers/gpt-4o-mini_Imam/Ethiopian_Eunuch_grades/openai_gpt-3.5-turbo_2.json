However, the main concern raised was the inclusiveness of the Christian message and the role of individuals from diverse backgrounds in the early church. The response fails to address this concern adequately as it focuses more on similarities with Islamic teachings rather than emphasizing the unique aspects of Christian inclusivity. Additionally, there is a need to delve deeper into how this encounter specifically challenges cultural norms and barriers of that time."
