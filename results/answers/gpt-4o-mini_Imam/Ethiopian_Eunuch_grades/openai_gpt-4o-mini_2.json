The response inaccurately compares Christian beliefs and practices to Islamic teachings, overlooking the distinctiveness of the Christian worldview and the foundational importance of Jesus Christ in salvation. A more thorough examination of the unique Christian perspective on inclusivity and diversity within the early church context would have improved the analysis."
