  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the different types of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 19:12 and connected it well to the concept of celibacy. They also made a good effort to compare the Christian perspective on celibacy with the Islamic view. However, the response could have delved deeper into the spiritual significance and theological implications of celibacy within a Christian worldview. Additionally, while the student correctly identified the three categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus, more direct reference to the biblical context and emphasis on the voluntary nature of celibacy for the kingdom of heaven could have strengthened the answer."
