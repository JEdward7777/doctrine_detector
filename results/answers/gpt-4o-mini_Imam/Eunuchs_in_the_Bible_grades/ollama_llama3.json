  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately summarizes Jesus' discussion of eunuchs in Matthew 19:12, highlighting the three types of eunuchs mentioned in the passage. It also provides some context about celibacy and its significance in both Christian and Islamic traditions.\n\nWhile the response is generally clear and concise, it could benefit from more depth and analysis to fully address the concern about understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy. The response primarily focuses on summarizing Jesus' statement rather than exploring the implications and nuances of his teaching.\n\nTo improve the grade, additional insights into the biblical context, theological significance, and practical applications of Jesus' words would be helpful."
