  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of Jesus' discussion on eunuchs in relation to celibacy, referencing the biblical context from Matthew 19:12. It effectively contrasts the Christian perspective on celibacy with the viewpoint in Islam, emphasizing the voluntary nature of celibacy for spiritual devotion. The explanation is well-supported and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and the motivations for choosing a celibate life."
