The explanation of the different types of eunuchs as discussed by Jesus is clear and aligns well with a Christian worldview. Additionally, the comparison with Islamic perspectives on celibacy adds depth to the analysis. This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and effectively addresses the concern raised."
