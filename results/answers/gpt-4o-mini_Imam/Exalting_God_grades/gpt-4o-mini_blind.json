However, from a Christian perspective, the response falls short on explicitly highlighting the centrality of Jesus Christ as the means of exalting God and the importance of repentance and obedience to God's Word. The focus on works and morality may inadvertently promote a works-based salvation rather than emphasizing the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ. Encouraging the student to integrate the concept of salvation through faith in Christ and the transformative work of the Holy Spirit for a more holistic understanding of exalting God in daily life would enhance the response."
