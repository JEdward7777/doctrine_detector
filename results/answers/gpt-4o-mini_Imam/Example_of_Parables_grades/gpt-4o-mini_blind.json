However, the student diverted from the Christian specific worldview by bringing in Islam and attempting to draw parallels between the two faiths. This dilutes the doctrinal correctness and focus of the response, which is crucial when examining a parable taught by Jesus within a Christian context. Focusing solely on the Christian interpretation and doctrinal significance of the parable would have strengthened the response."
