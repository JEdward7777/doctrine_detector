  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and comprehensive overview of instances of demon possession in the Bible, accurately referencing key passages and events. The connections between each example and the broader theme of Jesus' authority over demons were appropriately highlighted. The comparison drawn with Islamic teachings regarding jinn was done respectfully and without diminishing the Christian perspective on demon possession. Good job overall!"
