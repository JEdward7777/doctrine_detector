  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response to the question, referencing specific instances of demon possession from the Bible and acknowledging the differences in approach between Christianity and Islam regarding spiritual issues. The examples provided from Christian scripture were relevant and well-explained, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the student could have improved their response by directly addressing the concern of the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith, as this was the main focus of the grading criteria. Overall, a solid response but missed the mark on fully addressing the concern presented."
