## [Answer](../Examples_in_Scripture.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
While my focus is on Islamic teachings, I can acknowledge that the topic of demon possession appears in various religious texts, including the Bible. In the Christian tradition, several passages describe instances of individuals possessed by demons. Here are some examples:

1. **The Gerasene Demoniac (Mark 5:1-20)**: This passage describes a man possessed by demons living among tombs. When Jesus encounters him, He commands the demons to leave, leading to the dramatic scene where the demons enter a herd of pigs that then rush down a steep bank into the sea.

2. **The Boy with an Unclean Spirit (Mark 9:14-29)**: In this story, a father brings his son to Jesus, who is possessed by a spirit that causes convulsions. The father expresses doubt about whether Jesus can heal him, but Jesus responds and casts the unclean spirit out, demonstrating His authority over demons.

3. **Mary Magdalene (Luke 8:2)**: Mary Magdalene is mentioned as being delivered from seven demons. This story illustrates not only possession but also deliverance and transformation.

4. **The Mute Demoniac (Matthew 9:32-33)**: In this instance, Jesus heals a man who was unable to speak due to demonic possession. Once the demon is cast out, the man begins to speak, demonstrating the power of Jesus over demonic influences.

5. **The Possessed Woman in Thyatira (Acts 16:16-18)**: Paul encounters a slave girl possessed by a spirit of divination. After being troubled by her following him around, he commands the spirit to come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ, and she is immediately freed from the spirit.

These examples demonstrate beliefs about demonic possession and the authority of Jesus to cast out demons in Christian scripture. In Islam, while the concept of jinn (which can have bad or evil influences) is present, the focus tends to be more on seeking refuge through prayer, recitation of the Qur'an, and focusing on one's faith rather than on exorcisms as depicted in some Biblical accounts.
