However, the response could have been improved by emphasizing the theological significance of guilt within Christian doctrine and the concept of atonement through Jesus Christ, which is fundamental to understanding guilt in a Christian worldview. Additionally, while the student's expertise lies in Islamic teachings, a more explicit acknowledgment of the differences in how guilt is understood and dealt with in Christian and Islamic faiths would have been beneficial."
