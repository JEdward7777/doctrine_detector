  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided well-detailed examples from the Bible demonstrating the concept of guilt, showing an understanding of how guilt operates in the context of personal transgressions and the need for repentance. However, the student's answer could have been improved by including the specific example given in the reference answer provided by the teacher, which highlights the contrast between innocence and guilt in the context of divine judgment. Integrating this key example would have strengthened the overall response and demonstrated a deeper engagement with the concern provided."
