The additional example of Pilate declaring Jesus innocent and the robber acknowledging guilt compared to Jesus in Luke 23:41 aligns well with the concern about understanding guilt in the context of justice and innocence and the need for divine judgment. The incorporation of both Christian and Islamic perspectives enriches the discussion on guilt and repentance from a faith-based worldview."
