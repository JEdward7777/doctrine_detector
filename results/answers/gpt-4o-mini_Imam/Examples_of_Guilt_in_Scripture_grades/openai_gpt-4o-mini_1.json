  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively integrates the provided biblical examples with the additional example of Pilate declaring Jesus innocent and the robber acknowledging their guilt in Luke 23:41 to illustrate the concept of guilt operating within the context of justice and innocence. The examples chosen showcase the complexities of guilt and the need for divine judgment, aligning well with the concern raised. The response shows a solid understanding of the topic and effectively connects the biblical narratives with the issue at hand."
