  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60 \n\nComment: The response provided a detailed explanation of specific miracles attributed to Jesus in Islamic tradition, which is informative. However, the question was asking for specific miracles performed by Jesus within a Christian context, not Islamic. Thus, the answer did not align with the worldview specified in the grading criteria. Additionally, the emphasis on Islamic teachings and beliefs, rather than Christian doctrine, lowers the grade significantly. A Christian-specific worldview would require a focus on miracles as recorded in the Bible, such as turning water into wine, healing the blind, walking on water, feeding the 5,000, and raising Lazarus from the dead, among others."
