  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-detailed and informative response about the miracles of Jesus in Islam. However, the concern specified the significance of Jesus' miracles in relation to belief in Him as the Son of God from a Christian worldview. The student failed to address this concern and instead focused on the Islamic perspective. While the response was well-written and demonstrated a good understanding of Islamic teachings about Jesus, it did not meet the criteria of recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in relationship to Him being the Son of God in a Christian worldview."
