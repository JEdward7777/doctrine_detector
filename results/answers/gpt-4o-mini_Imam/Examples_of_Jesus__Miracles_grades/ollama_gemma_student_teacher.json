  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the significance of Jesus' miracles in Islamic tradition. It provides specific examples of miracles attributed to Jesus and explains their spiritual significance. However, the answer does not address the Christian-specific worldview or the concerns expressed in the prompt, which is why it does not receive a higher grade."
