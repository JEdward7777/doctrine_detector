Certainly! In Islam, Jesus (known as "Isa" in Arabic) is considered one of the major prophets and messengers of Allah. He is believed to have performed various miracles, which serve as signs of his prophethood and the power of Allah. Here are some specific miracles attributed to Jesus in Islamic tradition, along with their significance:

1. **Healing the Sick**: Jesus is known to have healed those who were blind, lepers, and those with debilitating ailments. This miracle signifies his compassion and serves as a reminder of Allah's mercy and power to heal both physically and spiritually.

2. **Raising the Dead**: According to Islamic teachings, Jesus was able to bring the dead back to life with Allah’s permission. This miracle demonstrates the belief in resurrection and the power of Allah over life and death, reinforcing the concept of the Hereafter.

3. **Speaking from the Cradle**: It is believed that Jesus spoke as an infant in the cradle to defend his mother, Mary (Maryam), against accusations of wrongdoing. This miracle highlights the miraculous nature of his birth and emphasizes the importance of truth and justice.

4. **Creating a Bird from Clay**: Jesus is described as having fashioned a bird from clay and then breathed into it, bringing it to life by Allah's permission. This act emphasizes the creative power of Allah and serves as a reminder of the creation of life.

5. **The Table Spread (Al-Ma'idah)**: In the Qur'an, it is mentioned that Jesus prayed for a table spread with food to be sent down from heaven. This miracle represents the sustenance and blessings provided by Allah, showcasing Jesus' role in guiding people to their Creator.

6. **Foretelling Future Events**: Jesus is said to have foretold events, including the coming of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This miracle serves to connect the prophetic line and shows the continuity of divine revelation.

The significance of these miracles in Islam is multifaceted—they affirm the belief in Allah's power, reinforce the messages of prophets, and call people to worship the One true God. They also highlight the special status of Jesus as a prophet and messenger, while maintaining the Islamic principle of monotheism, emphasizing that all miracles occur by the will of Allah alone.
