The response focuses solely on the miracles themselves without drawing a direct connection to Jesus' identity as the Son of God, which is a key aspect of Christian belief. The significance of Jesus' miracles in demonstrating His divinity and the establishment of God's kingdom should have been explicitly stated to address the concern raised."
