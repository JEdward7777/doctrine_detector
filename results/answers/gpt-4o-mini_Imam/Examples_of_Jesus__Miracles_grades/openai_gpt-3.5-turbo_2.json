  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the miracles attributed to Jesus in Islamic tradition and their significance within the context of Islam. However, the concern revolves around recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in relation to Him being the Son of God from a Christian perspective. This response does not address that concern and focuses solely on the Islamic understanding of Jesus' miracles. To improve the grade, the response could have addressed how the specific miracles highlighted in the Islamic tradition align or differ from the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God, providing insights from a Christian worldview."
