In a Christian worldview, Jesus' miracles are indeed significant, not only as signs of His divinity and God's kingdom but also as concrete demonstrations of His unique identity as the Son of God. It is important to emphasize the deity of Jesus and His role in the Trinity when discussing His miracles from a Christian perspective."
