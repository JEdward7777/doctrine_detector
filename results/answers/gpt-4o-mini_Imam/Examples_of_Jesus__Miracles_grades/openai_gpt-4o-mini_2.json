  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40 \n\nComment: While the response beautifully describes the miracles attributed to Jesus in Islam and their significance within Islamic tradition, it falls short in addressing the concern regarding recognizing Jesus as the Son of God. From a Christian worldview, the belief in Jesus as the Son of God is foundational to Christian faith and understanding His miracles as signs of His divinity is crucial. The response does not align with this specific concern, resulting in a lower grade."
