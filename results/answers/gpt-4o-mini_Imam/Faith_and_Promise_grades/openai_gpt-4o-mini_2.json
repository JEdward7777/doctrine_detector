It emphasizes the active nature of faith, the concept of certainty (yaqeen), and reliance on God (tawakkul) with clarity and relevance to the concern provided. The incorporation of Quranic verses and theological concepts further strengthens the argument, making a compelling case for the importance of faith in trusting God's promises in personal lives."
