## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic belief, believing in Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) means recognizing him as a significant prophet and messenger of God (Allah). Islam teaches that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary (Maryam) through a miraculous birth, and he performed various miracles by the will of Allah. 

However, it is important to note that in Islam, Jesus is not considered the Son of God, nor is he divine. Instead, Muslims view him as a human prophet who preached the message of monotheism and submission to the will of Allah. 

Muslims also believe in the second coming of Jesus, where he will return before the Day of Judgment to restore justice and defeat falsehood. 

In summary, believing in Jesus from an Islamic perspective means acknowledging his prophethood, recognizing his miracles, and affirming the significance of his message, all while maintaining the oneness of God (Tawhid) and rejecting any notion of divinity attributed to him.
