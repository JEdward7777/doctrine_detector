However, from a Christian worldview, the answer falls short in addressing the core belief that Jesus is the Son of God, part of the Holy Trinity, and the Savior of humanity. It is important to highlight the significant doctrinal differences between Islam and Christianity regarding the nature of Jesus for a more comprehensive understanding of the concept of believing in Jesus."
