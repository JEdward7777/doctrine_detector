However, the core Christian beliefs about Jesus as the Son of God, his sacrificial death for sins, and the importance of living in a way that honors him were not directly addressed or affirmed. Further explanation connecting Islamic beliefs with the Christian notion of faith and trust in Jesus would have been helpful in this context."
