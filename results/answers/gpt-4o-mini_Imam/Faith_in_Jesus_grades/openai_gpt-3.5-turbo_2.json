However, the given answer centered on Christian beliefs regarding Jesus as the Son of God and the importance of his sacrifice for sins in personal life, which is not addressed in the Islamic perspective. The response could have been improved by relating the implications of faith and trust in Jesus to personal life within an Islamic framework."
