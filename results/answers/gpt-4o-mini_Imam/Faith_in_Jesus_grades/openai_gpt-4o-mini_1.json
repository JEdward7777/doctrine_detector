From a Christian worldview, belief in Jesus goes beyond acknowledging his prophethood and miracles; it involves recognizing him as the Son of God, understanding his sacrificial atonement for sins, and living a life that reflects love and obedience to him. Therefore, while the response is informative about Islamic views, it does not directly address the concern from a Christian perspective."
