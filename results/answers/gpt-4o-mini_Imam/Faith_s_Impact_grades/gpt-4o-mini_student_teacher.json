  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-written and thoughtful, does not directly address the concern of recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life from a Christian perspective. The answer provided focuses more on general principles of faith and ethical behavior rather than specifically tying these manifestations back to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in a believer. A stronger connection to the Christian worldview and the unique role of the Holy Spirit in producing spiritual fruits would significantly improve the response."
