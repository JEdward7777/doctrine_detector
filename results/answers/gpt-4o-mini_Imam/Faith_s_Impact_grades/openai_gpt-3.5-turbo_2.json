  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough exploration of how true faith in Jesus, from an Islamic perspective, can manifest in an individual's life. The emphasis on values such as submission to God's will, moral conduct, prayer, charity, humility, community engagement, reflection, and acceptance of diversity aligns well with Christian teachings on genuine faith producing good spiritual fruits. However, the response did not directly address the given answer that true faith in Jesus produces good spiritual fruits because the Holy Spirit lives in the individual. While the content of the response is insightful and relevant, the lack of direct engagement with the specified concern impacted the overall grade."
