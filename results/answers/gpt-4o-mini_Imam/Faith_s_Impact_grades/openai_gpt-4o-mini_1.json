However, it does not directly address the given answer that true faith in Jesus produces good spiritual fruits because of the Holy Spirit living within the individual. While the provided response is insightful and well-written, it lacks alignment with the specified concern. Further integration of the Christian-specific worldview regarding the role of the Holy Spirit in producing genuine faith would enhance the response."
