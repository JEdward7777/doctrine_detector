While the concept of the Holy Spirit living in believers is not directly addressed, the emphasis on the importance of genuine faith producing good spiritual fruits aligns with the concerns of recognizing authentic faith in daily life. The response effectively demonstrates how faith impacts one's actions and interactions with others, reflecting true belief in Jesus."
