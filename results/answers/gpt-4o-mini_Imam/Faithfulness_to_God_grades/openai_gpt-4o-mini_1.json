The response draws parallels to Islamic beliefs without sufficiently highlighting the unique Christian perspective on faithfulness to God. It could have delved more deeply into the Christian understanding of faith, such as the role of grace, the redemptive work of Christ, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in enabling believers to be faithful. More explicit references to biblical passages or principles would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
