  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The student provided a well-written explanation of grace from an Islamic perspective. However, the answer deviates from the Christian view of grace, which is central to salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. In Christian theology, grace is understood as the unmerited favor and love of God towards sinners, demonstrated through the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross for the redemption of humanity. The answer did not address this key aspect of Christian belief, resulting in a lower grade. It is important to ensure answers align with the specific worldview being asked for in the question."
