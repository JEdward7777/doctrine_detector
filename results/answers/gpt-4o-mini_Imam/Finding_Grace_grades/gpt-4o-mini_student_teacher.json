  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nThe student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of grace in Islamic theology and how individuals can seek and attain God's favor. While the answer is well-written and insightful, it deviates from the Christian specific worldview requested. The answer focuses on Islamic beliefs and examples rather than providing a Christian perspective on finding grace in the eyes of God. Therefore, the grade reflects the depth of understanding and explanation provided, but deducts points for not aligning with the specified concern of using a Christian-specific worldview."
