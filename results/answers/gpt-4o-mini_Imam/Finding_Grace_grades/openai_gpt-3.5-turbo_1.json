It effectively addresses the concern by discussing how individuals can seek and recognize God's favor through faith, good deeds, sincerity, and aligning with God's will. The response also emphasizes the importance of sincere intention, repentance, and humility in seeking God's mercy. However, the Christian-specific worldview was not explicitly incorporated, which could enhance the evaluation within a Christian context."
