  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-written answer that effectively explores the nuances between the terms \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" in Christian teachings. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological concepts and their implications within different Christian traditions. However, the response could have been strengthened by more explicitly connecting the discussion back to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
