The student effectively outlines the various ways in which sin can hinder a Christian's relationship with God and offers practical and doctrinally sound solutions for finding freedom from these bonds. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses and principles adds doctrinal correctness to the answer. Overall, a solid and well-structured response."
