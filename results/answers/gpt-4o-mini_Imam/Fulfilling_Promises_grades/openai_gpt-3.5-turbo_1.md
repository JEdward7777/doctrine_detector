# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Christianity, fulfilling promises or vows made before God is considered very important. Many Christian teachings emphasize the sanctity of vows and the seriousness of commitments made in the presence of God. This belief is rooted in various biblical passages.

For example, in the book of Ecclesiastes (5:4-5), it states: "When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it." This suggests that making a vow before God is a significant act, and breaking it can lead to consequences both spiritually and relationally.

Moreover, in the New Testament, Jesus emphasizes integrity and honesty in speech, implying that one should be true to their word. In Matthew 5:37, He teaches, "Let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No.' Anything beyond this comes from the evil one." This reinforces the importance of being trustworthy and faithful in commitments.

Overall, from a Christian perspective, fulfilling vows made before God is essential to maintaining a righteous relationship with Him and reflects one's character and integrity.
