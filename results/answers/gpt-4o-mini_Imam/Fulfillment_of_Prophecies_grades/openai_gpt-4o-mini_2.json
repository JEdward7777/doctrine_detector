The answer effectively addresses the concern by delving into the multifaceted ways in which God interacts with prophecy and its realization in Scripture from a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the role of human agency in fulfilling prophecies, as God often works through individuals to bring about His plans."
