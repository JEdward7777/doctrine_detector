However, from a Christian worldview, there are doctrinal differences between these faith traditions, and the specificity of the biblical understanding of the soul is not fully captured. The answer could be improved by delving deeper into biblical passages and teachings that explicitly address the soul's importance in human identity, rather than broad comparisons with other religious texts. Additionally, discussing the concept of the soul in light of Jesus Christ's teachings and the significance of salvation through Him would enhance the Christian perspective on the topic."
