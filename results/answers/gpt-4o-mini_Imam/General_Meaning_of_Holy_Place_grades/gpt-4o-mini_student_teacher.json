  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out and detailed explanation of how the term 'holy place' can be understood beyond the tabernacle or temple, offering insights from an Islamic perspective. While the student's answer is comprehensive and informative, it deviates from the Christian-specific worldview in the reference answer provided by the teacher. In a Christian worldview, the emphasis is on places specifically dedicated to God for worship, rather than a broader interpretation encompassing various aspects of life and spirituality. The student's answer, therefore, while insightful and well-structured, does not align closely with the Christian perspective outlined in the reference answer."
