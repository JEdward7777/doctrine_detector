However, the answer focuses on Islamic practices and beliefs related to Allah, which do not align with the Christian worldview. The student should have addressed ways in which a believer in the Christian faith can actively glorify God in their daily life, such as prayer, studying the Bible, worshiping in community, showing love and compassion to others, living a life of integrity, and spreading the message of salvation. The response would have been greatly improved by framing the practices within the context of Christianity."
