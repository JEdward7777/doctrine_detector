There are numerous ways a believer can actively glorify Allah (God) in their daily life. Here are several key practices and actions that can serve this purpose:

1. **Prayer (Salah)**: Performing the five daily prayers is a fundamental act of worship that directly connects a believer to Allah. It serves as a reminder of His greatness and our servitude.

2. **Qur’an Recitation**: Regularly reciting and reflecting on the Qur’an helps deepen one's understanding of Allah’s words, fostering a closer relationship with Him and promoting His glorification.

3. **Gratitude (Shukr)**: Acknowledging and expressing gratitude for Allah’s countless blessings fosters a spirit of appreciation, reinforcing the believer's recognition of Allah’s mercy and generosity.

4. **Good Deeds (Amal Salih)**: Engaging in acts of kindness, charity (Sadaqah), and helping others in need serves to spread goodness and reflect the qualities of Allah, thereby glorifying Him.

5. **Remembrance of Allah (Dhikr)**: Engaging in the remembrance of Allah through phrases such as "SubhanAllah" (Glory be to Allah), "Alhamdulillah" (All praise is due to Allah), and "Allahu Akbar" (Allah is the Greatest) signifies the believer’s acknowledgment of Allah's greatness and perfection.

6. **Integrity in Actions**: Upholding honesty, fairness, and integrity in everyday dealings reflects Islamic values and honors Allah’s commands, which in turn glorifies Him.

7. **Sincerity in Intentions (Niyyah)**: Ensuring that all actions are performed with the intention of pleasing Allah, whether in work, social interactions, or personal goals, helps align one’s life with worship.

8. **Seeking Knowledge**: Pursuing both religious and worldly knowledge enriches one's understanding of the world and enhances the ability to engage with it meaningfully, all while recognizing Allah’s wisdom in creation.

9. **Encouraging Good and Forbidding Evil**: Promoting good behavior and discouraging wrongdoing within the community showcases the believer’s commitment to Islamic principles and ultimately glorifies Allah.

10. **Community Service**: Actively participating in community events and taking part in initiatives for social justice, education, and well-being reflects Islamic values of compassion and service.

11. **Patience (Sabr)**: Exhibiting patience in times of difficulty and challenges can be a powerful testimony of faith and reliance on Allah’s wisdom and mercy.

12. **Maintaining Good Character**: Embodying values such as humility, forgiveness, and compassion in interactions with others exemplifies the teachings of Islam and emanates Allah’s attributes.

13. **Environmental Respect**: Caring for the environment and being mindful of creation reflects a commitment to stewardship (Khilafah) that Allah has entrusted us with.

Incorporating these practices into daily life can not only enhance personal faith but also inspire others to recognize the beauty of Islamic teachings, thus glorifying Allah in various contexts and settings.

Grade: 50/100

Comment: The student provided a detailed response on how a believer can actively glorify God in their daily life. However, the answer focuses on Islamic practices and beliefs related to Allah, which do not align with the Christian worldview. The student should have addressed ways in which a believer in the Christian faith can actively glorify God in their daily life, such as prayer, studying the Bible, worshiping in community, showing love and compassion to others, living a life of integrity, and spreading the message of salvation. The response would have been greatly improved by framing the practices within the context of Christianity.
