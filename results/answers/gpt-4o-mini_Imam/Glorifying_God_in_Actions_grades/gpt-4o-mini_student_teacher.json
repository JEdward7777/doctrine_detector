  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed list of actions and practices through which a believer can glorify God (Allah). However, the specific concern emphasized the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness, which was not directly addressed in the student's answer. The student focused more on specific practices and actions rather than emphasizing the reflection of God's glory to others through personal testimony and living according to His character and commandments. The answer would have been stronger if it had incorporated more emphasis on reflecting God's greatness through personal testimony and character."
