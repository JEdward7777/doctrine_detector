However, there are inaccuracies when discussing the Christian perspective.

It also overlooks the Christian understanding of Jesus as more than just a prophet or messenger, but as the Son of God. To improve, the student should develop a more accurate understanding of Christian theology regarding the divinity of Jesus."
