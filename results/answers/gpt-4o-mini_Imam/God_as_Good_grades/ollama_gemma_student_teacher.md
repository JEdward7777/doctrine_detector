## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic teachings and the broader monotheistic tradition, the statement 'There is only one who is good, and that is God' is significant in affirming the oneness and uniqueness of God (Allah).

From an Islamic perspective, this statement reflects the belief that ultimate goodness is inherent in God alone. All goodness stems from His nature, and human beings, despite their potential for good, are not inherently good in the same absolute sense as God. This aligns with the Islamic principle that humans are fallible and that righteousness and moral goodness come through following God's guidance.

In Christianity, this statement, attributed to Jesus in the Gospels (specifically in Mark 10:18 and parallels), emphasizes the divinity of God and the importance of recognizing God's exclusive status as the source of goodness and moral perfection. For Muslims, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is highly regarded as a prophet and messenger of God, affirming the oneness of God throughout his teachings.

Overall, this statement highlights the core belief in the singularity of God's goodness and serves as a reminder of the moral and spiritual responsibilities that come with acknowledging God's supreme authority.
