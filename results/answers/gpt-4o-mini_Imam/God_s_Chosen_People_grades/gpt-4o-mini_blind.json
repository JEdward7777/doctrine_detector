However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to note that the concept of a remnant in Islam differs significantly from the Christian understanding. In Christianity, the remnant typically refers to a faithful minority preserved by God's grace within a larger community that has turned away from Him. The explanation should have also emphasized the salvific nature of God's grace towards His remnant, pointing to Jesus Christ as the ultimate embodiment of God's selective grace for His people. Additionally, there should have been a distinction made between the Christian view of grace as unmerited favor versus the implication in the Islamic view that grace is earned through sincerity, faith, and righteousness. The explanation could have been improved by highlighting the biblical references to the remnant in the Old and New Testaments, such as Romans 11:5 which states, \"So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.\""
