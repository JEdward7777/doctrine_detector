## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Christian tradition, the Bible portrays God as compassionate and merciful. Several passages highlight this aspect of God's nature:

1. **Exodus 34:6-7** – In this passage, God describes Himself to Moses: "The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin."

2. **Psalm 103:8-14** – This Psalm emphasizes God's compassion: "The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. He will not always chide; neither will he keep his anger forever. He has not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities."

3. **Matthew 9:36** – The New Testament also illustrates God's compassion through Jesus. "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."

4. **Luke 6:36** – Jesus instructs his followers to emulate God's nature: "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful."

These verses portray a God who is deeply aware of human suffering and injustice and who responds with kindness and an invitation for repentance and healing. Similarly, in Islam, Allah is also described as "The Most Compassionate" (Ar-Rahman) and "The Most Merciful" (Ar-Rahim), emphasizing a shared understanding of God's compassionate nature across both faiths.
