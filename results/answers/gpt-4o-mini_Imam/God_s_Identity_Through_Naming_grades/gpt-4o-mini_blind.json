However, the response did not align with a Christian worldview, as it focused solely on Islamic beliefs and concepts rather than offering a Christian perspective on the topic. Furthermore, it did not incorporate any references to biblical passages or Christian teachings to support the discussion. In a Christian-specific context, it is important to emphasize the uniqueness of God's relationship with His children, the significance of being called by name in the Bible, and the implications for one's identity, purpose, and belonging in Christ."
