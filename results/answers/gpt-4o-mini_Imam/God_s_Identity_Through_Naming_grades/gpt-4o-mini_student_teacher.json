  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the concept of being \"called by my name\" in Islamic theology, which is insightful and well-written. However, the student did not fully address the concern of exploring the implications of identity and belonging to God in a Christian's life. The response focuses on Islamic beliefs and lacks the Christian-specific perspective required for this assignment. The student's analysis demonstrates critical thinking and understanding of theological concepts, but the divergent focus from the Christian worldview impacts the overall grading."
