The mention of the context of Exodus and the comparison to a husband expecting loyalty from his wife is beneficial in illustrating the concept. However, the inclusion of the Islamic perspective, while informative, is not directly relevant to the question asked, which specifically pertains to the description of God's jealousy in the Bible. Focusing solely on the Christian understanding of God's jealousy would have strengthened the response."
