  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of God's jealousy in the Bible, emphasizing the importance of loyalty and covenant relationship with God. They made a good effort to connect the concept to examples from scripture, specifically the Book of Exodus. However, the student deviated from the Christian worldview by introducing an Islamic perspective, which was not requested in the question. The answer would have been stronger if it had remained focused solely on the Christian understanding of God's jealousy."
