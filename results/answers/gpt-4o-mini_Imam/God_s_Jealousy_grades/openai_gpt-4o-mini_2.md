## [Answer](../God_s_Jealousy.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Bible, when God is described as "jealous," it reflects God's passionate desire for loyalty and a covenant relationship with His people. This concept of jealousy does not bear the same negative connotations that jealousy can have in human terms, such as envy or insecurity. Instead, it denotes God's protective fervor for the worship and devotion of His followers.

For example, in the context of the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the Book of Exodus (Exodus 20:5), God expresses His jealousy in relation to idolatry. This signifies that God desires exclusive worship and fidelity from His people, much like a husband would expect loyalty from his wife. It emphasizes the seriousness of turning away from God and engaging in practices that are counter to His commandments and covenant.

From an Islamic perspective, the attribute of being "jealous" can be understood in terms of God's singularity and His rights over His creation. In Islam, God (Allah) is also protective over His oneness (Tawhid) and desires that humans recognize and worship Him alone, without associating partners with Him (Shirk).

Thus, the attribute of jealousy in the context of the Bible portrays Godâ€™s deep commitment to His people and His desire for a sincere, undivided relationship with them. This theme is similarly echoed in Islam, where the concept of God's oneness invites believers to place their worship and devotion solely towards Allah.
