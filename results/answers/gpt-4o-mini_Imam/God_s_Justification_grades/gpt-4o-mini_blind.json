The primary focus should have been on the Christian doctrine of justification by faith through the grace of God, as revealed in the Scriptures. The student's answer, therefore, lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic beliefs and practices may cause confusion in the reader regarding the differences between Christian and Islamic soteriology."
