However, it does not address the specified concern about clarifying the Christian doctrine of justification through faith in Jesus for salvation. From a Christian worldview, the response lacks the crucial point that God justifies sinners through faith in Jesus Christ as the atoning sacrifice for their sins, which is central to the Christian understanding of justification and salvation."
