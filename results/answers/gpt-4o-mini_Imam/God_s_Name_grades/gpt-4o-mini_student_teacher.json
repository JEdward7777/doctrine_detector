While they acknowledge the importance of the name 'Yahweh' in the Hebrew Bible and its association with God's eternal and unchanging nature, they could have delved deeper into the Christian worldview's perspective on the significance of this name. The focus on Islamic beliefs, while relevant in a comparative analysis, could be more balanced with a stronger emphasis on the Christian understanding of 'Yahweh.'"
