## [Answer](../God_s_Name.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In a Muslim context, the name "Yahweh" is primarily recognized as a name for God used in the Hebrew Bible, particularly within the traditions of Judaism and Christianity. It derives from the tetragrammaton YHWH, which is considered sacred in Jewish tradition. The name is often translated as "LORD" in many English versions of the Bible and is closely associated with the concept of God's eternal and unchanging nature.

From an Islamic perspective, while we acknowledge the importance of God's names in other Abrahamic faiths, we focus on the names of God as presented in the Qur'an. In Islam, God is referred to by the Arabic name "Allah," which encompasses the same monotheistic essence as 'Yahweh.' Both names reflect the singular nature of God, who is merciful, compassionate, and the creator of the universe.

In summary, the significance of "Yahweh" in the Bible denotes God's personal and covenantal relationship with His people. In Islam, we emphasize the attributes and names of Allah as described in the Qur'an, recognizing the unity and oneness of God, which is fundamentally similar to the conception of God found in the Bible, but acknowledged through different names and linguistic traditions.
