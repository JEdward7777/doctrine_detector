  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided an in-depth and thoughtful analysis of the term \"Almighty\" in the context of God from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing Allah's infinite power, sovereignty, judgment, protection, and mercy. While the response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept, the focus deviates slightly from the specific Christian worldview that was expected for this grading. The student could have integrated more Christian theological perspectives and references to Scripture to align closer with the given answer and the concern of understanding God's omnipotence in the context of faith and worship."
