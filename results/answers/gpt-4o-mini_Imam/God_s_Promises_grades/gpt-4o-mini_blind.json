However, the response lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective. It is important to note that Christian theology views God's promises in a distinct light, especially concerning the fulfillment of these promises in Jesus Christ. Additionally, the response could benefit from more explicit references to biblical examples and teachings to align more closely with a Christian worldview."
