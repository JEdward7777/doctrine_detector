  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-thought-out answer from an Islamic perspective, offering relevant spiritual practices and advice for discerning God's plan. However, the response does not align with the Christian worldview specified in the given answer. In a Christian context, the emphasis is on prayer, reading the Bible, seeking counsel from mature Christians, and observing circumstances through a Biblical lens. While the student's answer is insightful and valuable from an Islamic standpoint, it does not directly address the Christian-specific approach to discerning God's plan, leading to a lower grade in this context."
