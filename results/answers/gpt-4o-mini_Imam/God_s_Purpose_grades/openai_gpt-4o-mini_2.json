  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive guide on discerning God's plan from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing prayer, consultation, reflection, Quranic study, patience, seeking knowledge, consistent efforts, and being open to change. While the response is highly informative and relevant to the concern, deducting points for not specifically referencing the Bible or mature Christians in the Islamic perspective provided. However, the guidance given is deeply rooted in spiritual principles and aligned with seeking God's will, offering valuable insights for believers navigating spiritual uncertainty."
