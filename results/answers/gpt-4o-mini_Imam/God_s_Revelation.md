## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Bible, God introduces Himself using various names that reveal different aspects of His nature and character. For instance:

1. **Yahweh (Jehovah)**: This is one of the most significant names for God in the Old Testament, often translated as "LORD" in English translations. It emphasizes God's self-existence and eternal nature. In Exodus 3:14, God reveals His name to Moses as "I AM WHO I AM," underscoring His eternal and unchanging nature.

2. **El Shaddai**: Translated as "God Almighty," this name signifies God's omnipotence and nurturing aspect. It is frequently used in the context of God's covenant with Abraham (Genesis 17:1).

3. **El Elyon**: Meaning "Most High God," this name underscores God's sovereignty and supremacy over all creation (Psalm 78:35).

4. **Adonai**: This name means "Lord" or "Master," indicating authority and leadership.

5. **Jehovah Jireh**: Translated as "The LORD Will Provide," this name reflects God's provision and care for His people (Genesis 22:14).

6. **Jehovah Rapha**: Meaning "The LORD Who Heals," it demonstrates God's ability to heal both physically and spiritually (Exodus 15:26).

7. **Abba**: This term is used in the New Testament and translates to "Father." It conveys a deep personal relationship with God, emphasizing intimacy and love (Romans 8:15).

These names and titles collectively offer a multifaceted understanding of God's identity, highlighting His divine attributes such as mercy, power, and relational qualities. While the Bible presents an understanding of God as per Christian theology, it is essential to remember that in Islam, God (Allah) is recognized as the same singular, all-powerful Creator, who is also referred to by 99 names (Asma'ul Husna) that encompass similar attributes like mercy, strength, and wisdom.
