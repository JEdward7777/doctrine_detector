  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a good job of recognizing the importance of God's revelation in understanding His character and relationship with His followers. The writer provides several examples of God's names and titles from the Bible, which demonstrates their knowledge of Scripture. They also highlight the significance of God's self-revelation, particularly through the name \"Yahweh\" or \"I AM WHO I AM.\"\n\nThe only thing that keeps this response from being a 100 is that it could be developed further. The writer could provide more detail and examples to support their points, and they could also explore how these names and titles relate to God's character and relationship with His followers in a more nuanced way.\n\nComment: This response provides a good starting point for exploring the importance of God's revelation in understanding His character and relationship with His followers. To take it to the next level, consider providing more specific examples from Scripture and developing your ideas further."
