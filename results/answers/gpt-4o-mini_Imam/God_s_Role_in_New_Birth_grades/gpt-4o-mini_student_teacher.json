  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding spiritual rebirth and the role of Allah in guiding individuals towards repentance and renewal of faith. However, the student did not address the Christian perspective on being born again, which is the focus of the question. The Christian viewpoint emphasizes that new birth is solely a work of God's grace and initiative, not achieved by human effort. Therefore, the student's response, while informative from an Islamic standpoint, does not directly answer the question with a Christian worldview."
