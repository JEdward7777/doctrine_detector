  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on spiritual rebirth and God's role in the process. It clearly articulates the concepts of Tawbah, Imaan, guidance, mercy, and the transformation of the heart. The inclusion of relevant Quranic verses and Hadith adds credibility to the response. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the idea of divine initiative in the new birth experience as highlighted in the reference answer."
