However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about recognizing God's sovereignty and grace as the primary initiators of the process of spiritual rebirth, which are central aspects of Christian doctrine. The Islamic concepts discussed emphasize human effort and divine guidance, but do not fully align with the Christian understanding of new birth as ultimately a work of God's grace and sovereignty."
