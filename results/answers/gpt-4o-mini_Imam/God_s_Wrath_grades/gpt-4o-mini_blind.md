In Islamic belief, the term "Day of Yahweh" is not commonly used since "Yahweh" refers specifically to the Hebrew name for God in Judeo-Christian contexts. However, the concept of the Day of Judgment, known as "Yawm al-Qiyamah" in Islam, parallels the themes found in other religious traditions regarding divine judgment.

In the Quran, the Day of Judgment is vividly described as a time when everyone will be resurrected and held accountable for their deeds. The punishment for those who have disbelieved or committed injustices is severe. Various verses narrate the conditions of that day, including:

1. **Resurrection and Reckoning**: Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:36-40) indicates that humans will be resurrected for judgment, and their deeds will be weighed.

2. **Hellfire**: The Quran frequently describes the punishments of Hell (Jahannam) for the wrongdoers. For example, Surah Al-Mulk (67:6) speaks of those who will face severe punishment in Hell, while Surah Al-Baqarah (2:81) mentions that those who do not believe will face eternal punishment.

3. **Fear and Regret**: The day is marked by extreme fear and regret among those who did not heed the signs of Allah. Surah Al-Hadid (57:20) emphasizes that this worldly life is temporary, and the reality of the afterlife will bring true consequences.

4. **Divine Justice**: The concept of justice is central. In Surah Al-Nisa (4:40), it is stated that Allah does not do injustice, and everyone will be rewarded or punished fairly according to their actions.

In conclusion, while the terminology may differ, the Islamic understanding of God's punishment on the Day of Judgment emphasizes accountability, retribution for deeds, and the severity of divine justice that will be manifest when all humans are resurrected and judged by Allah.
