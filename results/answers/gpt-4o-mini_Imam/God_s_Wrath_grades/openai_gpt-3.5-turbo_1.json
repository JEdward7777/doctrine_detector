  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic concept of the Day of Judgment, emphasizing accountability, retribution for deeds, and the severity of divine justice. It effectively addressed the concern regarding the consequences for disbelief by discussing the punishment in Hell for wrongdoers and disbelievers. The inclusion of Quranic references further supported the response. The only area for improvement could be to explicitly tie in the concept of God's wrath as described in the provided answer to the broader theme of divine judgment and consequences for disbelief."
