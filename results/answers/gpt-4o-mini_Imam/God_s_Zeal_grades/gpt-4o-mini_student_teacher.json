  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of how the term \"zeal of the Lord\" reflects God's actions towards His people. The response effectively incorporates biblical references and interpretations to support their points. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern provided, focusing more on how recognizing God's zeal deepens believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being. Additionally, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the aspect of justice in relation to God's zeal, as highlighted in the reference answer."
