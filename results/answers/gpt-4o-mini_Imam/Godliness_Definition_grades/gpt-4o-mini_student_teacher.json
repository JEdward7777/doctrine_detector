  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as a 90.\n\nWhile the student did an excellent job providing a detailed explanation of 'godliness' from a Christian perspective, referencing key Bible verses to support their points, they did not directly address the concern of clarity on how to incorporate godliness into daily life and actions. The response focused more on defining godliness rather than providing practical guidance for application in daily living. \n\nThe student's understanding of the concept and its significance in Christianity is commendable, but they could have enhanced their response by offering specific examples or practical suggestions on how individuals can actively live out godliness in their everyday actions."
