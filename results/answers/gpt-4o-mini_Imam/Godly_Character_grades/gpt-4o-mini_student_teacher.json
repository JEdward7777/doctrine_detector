  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful comparison between the fruits of the Holy Spirit and Islamic virtues, demonstrating an understanding of how similar principles are present in different faith traditions. However, the student deviated significantly from the Christian-specific focus of the question, complicating the direct application of the teachings to a Christian worldview. The response could be enhanced by focusing more on the Christian perspective and demonstrating a deeper understanding of the unique aspects of godly character within a Christian context."
