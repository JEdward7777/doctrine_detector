It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how these characteristics of a godly individual can be cultivated within both faith traditions. The integration of Islamic principles with the Christian perspective demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter and exemplifies a holistic view of spiritual virtues across different religious contexts. Well done!"
