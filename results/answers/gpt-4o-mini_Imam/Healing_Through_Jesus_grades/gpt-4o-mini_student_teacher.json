  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 80. \n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals, they did not explicitly mention the foundational element of recognizing the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing, which was the specified concern. The student effectively covered Jesus' authority over demons and his compassion for the suffering, but they could have strengthened their answer by highlighting the importance of prayer and faith in the healing process. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but missed addressing one specific aspect."
