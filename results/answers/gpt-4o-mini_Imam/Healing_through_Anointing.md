## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The practice of anointing in the New Testament is often associated with healing, both physically and spiritually. While this concept is not central to Islamic teachings, it is valuable to understand its context within the New Testament narratives.

Anointing with oil in the New Testament can be seen in several passages, particularly in the Gospels and the Epistles. Here are a few significant examples:

1. **James 5:14-15** - This passage encourages the sick to call for the elders of the church, who should pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer of faith is said to save the sick, indicating a direct correlation between the act of anointing and healing.

2. **Mark 6:13** - Here, the disciples are noted to have anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. This showcases anointing as a tangible action associated with invoking God's healing power.

3. **Luke 4:18** - Jesus reads from the scroll of Isaiah, proclaiming that He has been anointed to bring healing and liberation. While this passage speaks more about spiritual healing and the overall mission of Jesus, it highlights the significance of anointing in a broader sense.

In the context of these scriptures, anointing serves both as a physical act and a symbolic gesture of invoking God's blessing and healing. It often accompanies prayer and the invocation of faith, emphasizing the belief that healing comes from God's power.

While Islam also recognizes the importance of prayer and supplication for healing, it may not directly correlate to the practice of anointing with oil as described in the New Testament. Instead, Muslims rely on prayers (dua), verses from the Qur'an, and various healing practices that align with Islamic teachings.

For a deeper understanding of healing in an Islamic context, the Qur'an and Hadith emphasize turning to Allah for healing, the importance of patience during illness, and the spiritual lessons derived from trials of health.
