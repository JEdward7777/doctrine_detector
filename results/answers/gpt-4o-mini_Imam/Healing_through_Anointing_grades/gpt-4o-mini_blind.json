However, the answer lacks depth in explaining the theological significance of anointing in the Christian faith specifically. It also downplays the sacramental nature and the understanding of anointing as a means of God's grace and healing power rather than just a symbolic gesture. The comparison with Islamic practices, while informative, overshadows the distinct Christian understanding and practice of anointing. Further exploration of the doctrinal implications and theological depth of anointing in Christian belief would enhance the response."
