  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the practice of anointing related to healing in the New Testament, citing relevant biblical passages and discussing the symbolic and tangible aspects of anointing. The answer is well-structured and shows a good understanding of the spiritual significance of anointing for healing. However, the student's comparison between Christian and Islamic perspectives on healing could be more focused on addressing the concern of recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing within Christian practice. Overall, a strong response with insightful analysis."
