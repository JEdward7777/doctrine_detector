It addresses the concern by discussing both physical and spiritual healing in connection to the practice of anointing. The response also highlights the difference in approach to healing between Christianity and Islam, showing a clear understanding of the role of anointing in Christian practice from a Christian worldview. The only room for improvement could be further elaboration on the specific theological significance of anointing in Christian belief."
