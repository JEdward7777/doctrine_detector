  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the practice of anointing in the New Testament, highlighting its association with healing in both physical and spiritual contexts. The student effectively addresses the concern by discussing the significance of anointing in seeking healing through God's intervention and power. The response also demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian perspective on anointing with references to relevant scriptures. However, the response could have been enhanced by further connecting the practice of anointing to the broader theme of seeking God's blessing and healing power in Christian belief."
