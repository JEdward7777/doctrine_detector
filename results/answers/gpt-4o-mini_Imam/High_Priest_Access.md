## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the biblical tradition, the Ark of the Covenant was a sacred object that represented God's presence among the Israelites and was housed within the innermost sanctum of the Tabernacle (and later in the Temple in Jerusalem). According to the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the Book of Exodus and the Book of Leviticus, specific rules governed who could approach the Ark and under what circumstances.

1. **The High Priest**: Primarily, the High Priest was the individual allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, where the Ark was located. This was only done once a year on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, when he would perform rituals for the atonement of the people of Israel.

2. **Purification**: Those who entered the presence of the Ark, particularly the High Priest, had to be ritually pure. This involved various forms of cleanliness and following specific sacrificial rituals as prescribed in the Torah.

3. **Specific Instructions**: The manner of approach was strictly outlined by God. For example, when the Ark was transported, it was to be carried by the Levites using poles that were fitted through rings on the Ark, never to be touched directly, as this was considered sacred.

4. **Consequences of Improper Approach**: There were severe consequences for improper handling or approaching the Ark without the right authorization. An example from the Bible is the story of Uzzah, who reached out to steady the Ark and was struck dead because he touched it, an act that violated the divine commandments regarding the Ark's handling.

In summary, only the High Priest was permitted to approach the Ark, and he could do so only under specific conditions of ritual purity and during designated times, underscoring the sanctity and holy nature of the Ark of the Covenant in the Israelite tradition.
