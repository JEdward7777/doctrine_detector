  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the restrictions and significance surrounding approaching the ark of the covenant, highlighting the role of the High Priest and emphasizing the importance of ritual purity and obedience to God's specific instructions. The additional details provided by the student further enhance the explanation, showing a depth of knowledge on the topic. However, the student could have concisely stated the key point that only the high priest could approach the ark, as mentioned in the reference answer, to align more closely with the Christian specific concern on the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God."
