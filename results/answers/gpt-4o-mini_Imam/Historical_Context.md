## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The concept of the "remnant" is a significant theme in the Hebrew Bible, particularly within the prophetic texts of Isaiah and Amos. In these contexts, the term "remnant" refers to a small group of people who remain faithful to God amidst widespread disobedience and injustice. This idea not only highlights the mercy of God but also serves as a promise of hope and restoration.

### Isaiah
1. **Isaiah 1:9** - Here, the prophet Isaiah speaks of a remnant that will survive the judgment that is to come upon Judah. He states that if the Lord of Hosts had not left a few survivors, they would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah, completely destroyed. This indicates that even in times of rebellion, God preserves a faithful remnant.

2. **Isaiah 10:20-22** - After detailing the judgment that would come against Israel, Isaiah speaks about the remnant of Israel who will rely on God. Specifically, only a remnant will return, highlighting the idea that despite the punishment, God will not abandon His people entirely.

3. **Isaiah 11:11-12** - This passage speaks of the Lord recovering the remnant of His people from various nations. It symbolizes hope for restoration and the gathering of those who have remained loyal to Him, thus indicating God's continued faithfulness despite the failures of His people.

### Amos
1. **Amos 5:3** - In a context of condemnation for the injustices seen in Israel, Amos proclaims that 'a remnant' of the nation will be saved, emphasizing those who will survive the coming devastation. The phrase denotes that while many will face judgment for their wrongdoings, there will still be a group that God will preserve.

2. **Amos 9:8-9** - Amos emphasizes that while God will destroy Israel, He will not entirely annihilate the house of Jacob. Here, he speaks of the sifting of the people, suggesting that though calamity will strike, a faithful remnant will remain, signifying that not every individual will be swept away, but only those unfaithful to God's covenant.

### Conclusion
In both Isaiah and Amos, the "remnant" serves as a powerful theological motif, reminding believers that God's mercy prevails even amid judgment. It emphasizes that faithfulness and righteousness have value in God's eyes, and that a core group of true believers will experience divine restoration and blessings. This idea is echoed in various Islamic teachings, where the theme of striving for faith and holding onto righteousness in challenging times is equally significant.
