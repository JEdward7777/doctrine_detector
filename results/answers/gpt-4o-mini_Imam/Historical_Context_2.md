## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a significant part of the Passover story, which is commemorated in the Jewish tradition. According to the Quran and the biblical narrative, God commanded the Israelites to prepare for their departure from slavery in Egypt by eating unleavened bread, known as "matzah" in Hebrew.

The main reason they ate unleavened bread (which is bread made without yeast) was because they had to leave Egypt hastily. Yeast requires time to rise, and there was no time for the dough to rise before they left. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:50), it is mentioned that Allah saved the Children of Israel and drowned Pharaoh and his army. This escape was urgent, and they needed to depart immediately, leading them to prepare and consume bread that could be made quickly.

Additionally, the unleavened bread is a symbol of their quick departure from bondage and a reminder of humility and simplicity. In Islam, we recognize the story of Moses (Musa) and the liberation of the Israelites as a sign of Allah's mercy and guidance. The observance of the unleavened bread during Passover reflects the themes of freedom and reliance on Allahâ€™s help in times of hardship.
