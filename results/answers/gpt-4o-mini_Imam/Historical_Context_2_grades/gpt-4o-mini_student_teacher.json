  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response contains some accurate information regarding the significance of unleavened bread during the Israelites' escape from Egypt and the symbolism it carries in Jewish and Islamic traditions. However, the student included references to the Quran and Islamic beliefs which are not part of a Christian worldview. The student's answer could have focused more on the specific Biblical account and theological reasons provided in the reference answer. The student demonstrated a good understanding but strayed away from the Christian-specific perspective required for this question."
